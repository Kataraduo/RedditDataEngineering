1c4nwy0,WTF? I'm tired of this crap,"Yes, ""data professional"" means nothing so I shouldn't take this seriously.

But if by chance it means ""data scientist""... why this people are purposely lying? You cannot be a data scientist ""without programming"". Plain and simple.

Programming is not something ""that helps"" or that ""makes you a nerd"" (sic), it's basically the core job of a data scientist. Without programming, what do you do? Stare at the data? Attempting linear regression in Excel? Creating pie charts?

Yes, the whole thing can be dismisses by the fact that ""data professional"" means nothing, so of course you don't need programming for a position that doesn't exists, but if she mean by chance ""data scientist"" than there's no way you can avoid programming.",387,116,MorningDarkMountain,2024-04-15 14:41:20,https://i.redd.it/w31p6ytmnnuc1.jpeg,0,False,False,False,False

1c4m8q6,How to negotiate salary when doing an internal move?,"Hi all,

Basically the title ‚Äî any tips on negotiating the salary when doing an internal move, and the hiring manager / HR most certainly know at least my pay bracket, if not the exact salary I have right now?

I only know some very rough numbers from colleagues and I tend to underestimate their budget / undersell when negotiating.

1c4r5sf,Does anyone use this potential alternative to gradient descent?,"&#x200B;

[ Step 1: there is some loss\/cost function but we don't know its optimal parameters ](https://preview.redd.it/vo2fb58taouc1.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&s=d700eadb8435238bcf549c71cf7974d0d1d27cc1)

&#x200B;

[ Step 2: solve for the derivatives at random points for the parameters and obtain tangent vectors for those points. ](https://preview.redd.it/td8kuu9waouc1.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e0d879dda0ebb502895350fc23a302393268f74)

&#x200B;

[ Step 3: Solve for where the vectors \\""cross\\"" \(when stretched\) in terms of the parameters, and plug those parameters into the loss function. If it seems to be a good place, you could try gradient descent\/back-prop starting from here. The vectors may not intersect at any point with respect to all parameters, but as long as they intersect with respect to enough of them you could try that coordinate. If not you can repeat the process until you find some tangent vectors that intersect with respect to enough parameters. ](https://preview.redd.it/ozkafxn0bouc1.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=81ba479a32c6572f6da6701d3d55d32e223d2507)

 I chose an example in 3 dimensions for obvious reasons. This might not run so fast or be so easy in higher dimensions. Curious to hear what people think though. And maybe this approach already exists?

1c4uvfr,"Real-time hypothesis testing, premature stopping ","Say I want to start offering a discount for shopping in my store. I want to run a test to see if it's a cost-effective idea. I demand an improvement of $d in average sale $s to compensate for the cost of the discount. I start offering the discount randomly to every second customer. Given the average traffic in my store, I determine I should be running the experiment for at least 4 months to determine the true effect equal to d at alpha 0.05 with 0.8 power. 


1. Should my hypothesis be: 

H0: s_exp - s_ctrl < d

And then if I reject it means there's evidence the discount is cost effective (and so I start offering the discount to everyone) 

Or 

H0: s_exp - s_ctrl > d 

And then if I don't reject it means there's *no* evidence the discount is *not* cost effective (and so i keep offering the discount to everyone or at least to half of the clients to keep the test going)


2. What should I do if after four months, my test is not conclusive? All in all, I don't want to miss the opportunity to increase the profit margin, even if true effect is 1.01*d, right above the cost-effectiveness threshold. As opposed to pharmacology, there's no point in being too conservative in making business right? Can I keep running the test and avoid p-hacking?


3. I keep monitoring the average sales daily, to make sure the test is running well. When can I stop the experiment before preassumed amount of sample is collected, because the experimental group is performing very well or very bad and it seems I surely have enough evidence to decide now? How to avoid p-hacking with such early stopping?


Bonus 1: say I know a lot about my clients: salary, height, personality. How to keep refining what discount to offer based on individual characteristics? Maybe men taller than 2 meters should optimally receive two times higher discount for some unknown reasons?


Bonus 2: would bayesian hypothesis testing be better-suited in this setting? Why?
