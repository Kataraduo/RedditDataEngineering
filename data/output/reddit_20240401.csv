1bsndqm,First job out of undergrad is really boring,"Hey all, im a fresh grad with a background with applied math and econ. I got a job really quickly after graduation as a data analyst at a large bank in my country (anti money laundering & compliance), but the actual responsibility of the role is more like a data entry position with excel. As you can imagine, it’s painfully dull and low paying aside from the advantage of good LSB (9-5). I’ve been working on a way to automate my work with python scripts, but aside from this there is really not much to add to my resume. 

My overall goal is to move to a backoffice positon in risk/investment research unit in my bank where they do something more quantitative like analytics, modelling and statistical analysis. What else could I be doing to get there in the future?
