lfv72l,"A set of Jupyter Notebooks to help you understand ML algorithms of regression, dimensionality reduction, unsupervised clustering, KNN, neural networks, etc.","Hey r/learnmachinelearning! I hope you all are all doing well. 

Recently I created SeaLion, a machine learning library designed to help newcomers learn ml in a way that's more about understanding the algorithm than its class functions. The librarie is well-tested and has 70+ stars on GitHub. 

In order to supplement the library I wanted to write some examples of what these algorithms could be used for. I did this in a series of 12 jupyter notebooks. I think that they are incredibly helpful as they apply ml algorithms to real world datasets like breast cancer, iris, titanic, spam classification, moons  MNIST, etc. They also compare and contrast a lot of the algorithms so you can see first hand which is best to use. 

You can find them over here : [GitHub Examples](https://github.com/anish-lakkapragada/SeaLion/tree/main/examples)

A list of all of what the notebooks are on can be found in the screenshot below :

I fine-tuned the 'small' `124M` GPT 2 model using `gpt-2-simple` on SpongeBob SquarePants episode transcripts that I scraped from the [Transcripts Wiki](https://transcripts.fandom.com/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#Episodes). The GitHub repo with the code I used to generate the results is [here](https://github.com/mikhailgaerlan/TV-Show-Script-Writer).

Sandy, you need to get that nut off my back. \[shivering\]

A nut?! \[picks up a nut\]

Thats not what I was talking about! \[pulls the nut off his back\]

Thats not what I meant by... You got him! \[shivering\]

Thats not what I meant! \[hangs up the nut and pulls back the nut\]

Thats not what I meant by... \[stops and looks around\]

Where is it? Where is it? Whats the big... \[stops and looks around again\]

...scam? Is it going on out here? \[starts pulling out his back\]

Thats not where... \[the nut lands on Sandys hand\]

Where is it? Thats not where. Sandy, I dont think you should be doing that.

Sandy! You dont know what youre talking about.

Oh, Sandy, I know that this isnt what Im talking about.

Oh, thats okay. Its not like I dont know anything about nuttastic. \[takes a deep breath\]

Okay, Ill just take this. \[takes the nut, puts it in a jar, and puts it in a blender\]

\[blends the nut, the blender, and the blender all talk at once\]

Okay, this is it! \[in a trance\]

Sandy, you didnt do a good job. Im sorry, SpongeBob, but you failed again. \[in a deeper trance\]

Sandy, did you hear that? \[jumps up and slams his face into a barrel\]

You failed again. \[stops and turns around\]

Okay, okay, Sandy, I know that. I just cant imagine what Im into all the time. Im a nutcase.

\[he jumps up and slams his face into the barrel\]

Youre not. \[jumps up on top of a barrel, picks up SpongeBob, and throws him\]

You failed again. Im a nutcase. Patrick, what are you doing?

Im a nutcase. I need to get a nut. What are you doing? \[jumps up on top of SpongeBob\]

I need to get a big nut. Patrick, I want to talk to you.

No, I dont want to talk to you. I want to talk to... \[Patrick turns around, and turns around twice, turning SpongeBob around\]

Patrick, you failed again. Sandy! \[starts knocking on the door, and Sandy comes in\]

Look, I really am sorry for everything I did. \[hanging onto the barrel, shoving it down, and then banging on it\]

Not only that, but you showed up late for work? \[crying\]

My brain was working all night to make up for the hours I wasted on making up so much cheese.

\[hanging on the barrel, then suddenly appearing\] Patrick, what are you...

\[Patrick turns around, and looks at him for his failure\] Sandy? \[crying\]

I know what you did to me brain. \[turns around, and runs off the barrel. Sandy comes in again\]

\[screams\] What the...? \[gets up, exhausted\]

Oh, Patrick, I got you something. \[takes the nut off of SpongeBobs head\]

Thats it. \[takes the nut from SpongeBobs foot\] Thats it. \[takes the nut off his face. He chuckles, then sighs\]

Thats the last nut I got. \[walks away\] Patrick, maybe you can come back later.

Oh, sure, Im coming with you. \[hangs up the barrel. Sandy walks into SpongeBobs house\] \[annoyed\]

Nonsense, buddy. You let Gary go and enjoy his nice days alone. \[puts her hat on her head\]

You promise me? \[she pulls it down, revealing a jar of chocolate\]

You even let me sleep with you? \[she opens the jar, and a giggle plays\]

Oh, Neptune, that was even better than that jar of peanut chocolate I just took. \[she closes the door, and Gary walks into his house, sniffles\]

Gary? \[opens the jar\] \[screams, and spits out the peanut chocolate\]

Gary?! \[SpongeBob gets up, desperate, and runs into his house, carrying the jar of chocolate. Gary comes back up, still crying\]

SpongeBob! \[SpongeBob sees the peanut chocolate, looks in the jar, and pours it in a bucket. Then he puts his head in the bucket and starts eating the chocolate. Gary slithers towards SpongeBobs house, still crying\]

SpongeBobs right! \[SpongeBob notices that some of the peanut chocolate is still in the bucket, so he takes it out. Then he puts the lid on the bucket, so that no",699,47,mikhailgaerlan,2020-11-05 05:44:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/jodejr/i_forced_a_bot_to_watch_over_1000_hours_of/,0,learnmachinelearning

adwft2,All the math you might need for machine learning [list of resources] (feel free to add and comment),"

1. https://mml-book.github.io/
Well, this is literally almost all the math necessary for machine learning. Covering everything in great detail requires more than ~400 pages, but overall this is the most detailed guide on the mathematics used in machine learning. 

2.	 http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf
	http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf
  These concise guides belong to the famous CS229 course by Andrew Ng and are very helpful for refreshing one's knowledge of linear algebra and probability theory. Don't expect it to be comprehensive. Expectedly, the primary purpose of the notes is to serve as a brief refresher that you can use to find out which subjects you should revisit.  

3. 	https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/linear_algebra.html
	https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/prob.html
Very close in quality and coverage to the notes above. 
By the way, both the notes from Stanford and DL Book also include additional notes on optimization, information theory, and some other subjects. Those, however, are decently covered in mml-book.

4. 	https://gwthomas.github.io/docs/math4ml.pdf
These notes spend less time on each subject, which doesn't make them bad though. I would recommend using this guide as a checklist of math prerequisites. 

5. https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mlr/marc/teaching/18-Maths/paper.pdf
Math for intelligent systems. The preface promises that this course will recap the essentials of linear algebra, optimization, probabilities, and statistics, which definitely sounds ambitious. Unlike other resources from the list, I have only briefly skimmed through the notes. 

6. 	https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html
Matrix calculus you might need for machine learning. 

7. https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf
A collection of facts and properties related to matrices. 

8.	http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/vmls.pdf
This is a great book on applied linear algebra in the context of machine learning. Not much time is spent on theoretical aspects, which is probably good considering the applied orientation of the book. 

9. http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf
Luckily free book on convex optimization.

10.	https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/
I wish I was taught statistics using an approach like this.

11.   https://the-learning-machine.com/article/machine-learning/linear-algebra
       https://the-learning-machine.com/article/machine-learning/calculus
https://the-learning-machine.com/article/machine-learning/unconstrained-optimization
A set of truly visual courses that help you not only understand the subject but also see what's going on under the mathematical hood. 

12.	https://probabilitycourse.com/
A free and high-quality book to learn probability and statistics. I believe the author has reached some sort of balance between rigor and intuition.

He makes an apology video, and when his victims ask for their refund, his followers respond with ""Be kind. He's asking for your forgiveness""","This is fucking sick..

People based in India, the Philippines, and other countries that do not have the resources to go after Siraj legally are those who need the money the most. 200$ could be a months worth of salary, or several months. And the types of people who get caught up in the scams are those who genuinely looking to improve their financial situation and work hard for it. This is fucking **cruel**. 

I'm having a hard time believing Siraj's followers are that brainwashed. Most likely alt accounts controlled by Siraj.

ey5tql,"Introducing Boring Data Science, a blog to learn about software engineering good practices in Data Science.","Hello everyone,

I'm a data scientist/analytics engineer with a few years of experience under my belt. Recently I decided to start a blog named [Boring Data science](https://guillaumelegoy.github.io/) to talk about the boring stuff in data science: testing code or data, setting up repositories, software engineering good practices, etc. So far it's aimed mostly at beginners or data analysts/data scientists/ BI analysts who want to adopt software engineering as part of their workflow. I believe in the value of reproducible code, testing, and security (devops aspect) in machine learning projects.

&#x200B;

The reason behind this project is that, in my humble opinion, there is a plethora of amazing machine learning/data science blogs and tutorials, but not enough focusing on the ""boring stuff"" I mention above. I am very grateful to have worked and to be still working with amazing DBAs and engineers who taught me a lot, so this is my turn to give back.

&#x200B;

This blog is mostly a learning experience for myself as well, as writing down concepts help me understand them better, and I don't claim to be an absolute expert, but I believe this can help others (I wish I knew this when I started!). Feedback or ideas for future posts are highly welcomed.

n0btp6,The hitchhikers guide to computer vision,"Hey there,

This is my first blog post ever - it is a summary of all the good knowledge that I have in the computer vision area. It is not a tutorial or how-to-use-something post, but rather a set of links, tips, lifehacks. Covers data governance, mlops, tools, courses. I tried to make it practical and useful. Link to the origin: [The Hitchhiker's guide to computer vision](https://irregularadel.substack.com/p/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-computer-21-04-28?r=l7n3m&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy)

So, are you tired of this towardsdatascience/medium tutorials and posts about deep learning? Don‚Äôt panic. ¬© Take another one.

&#x200B;

[I was thinking to add some DL meme at the beginning and my friend come up with this. Adel is me, by the way \( Õ°‚ùõ ·¥• Õ°‚ùõ\) ](https://preview.redd.it/jmhcpovghyv61.jpg?width=1076&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eedf09c31fc497682b4dffed470f60efbb4a1617)

So, as I said, there are so many educational resources around the deep learning area that at some point I found myself lost in all that mess. There are tons of towardsdatascience/medium tutorials on how to use something, and most of them are on a beginner‚Äôs level (although I enjoined some of the articles).

I felt that there should be something higher than ‚Äúpiece of cake‚Äù or ‚Äúbring it on‚Äù levels. Like ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù or even ‚Äúnightmare‚Äù. In the end, I want resources that will bring value, and not something I already know. I don‚Äôt need detailed tutorials (well, usually), instead, I want to see directions. Some reference points from where I can start my own path. And it may be the case, that I can write such an article for others, who feel the same way.

So I came to the idea of a short ‚Äúhow-to-and-how-not-to‚Äù post on the computer vision area (mostly from DL perspective). Some links, tips, lifehacks. Hope it will create adding value for someone. And hope it won‚Äôt be yet another boring tutorial.

Finally, a small disclaimer: these are my personal beliefs and feelings, they are not necessarily true. Moreover, I feel that some of the points are not optimal solutions, and I would be happy if someone will propose a better option.

Enjoy!

## Now, let‚Äôs start with the tools and infrastructure, for your CV research.

In general, several areas should be presented in your projects. There are a huge number of options in each area, and you can easily get lost. I believe that you should just choose one sample from each area and stick to it. These areas are:

* Starting from simple. **Language** ‚Äî without doubts, python. Others are way below. (Sorry R and [Matlab ](https://pics.me.me/pytorch-tensorflow-matlab-source-unknown-deep-learning-frameworks-war-52460350.png)users).
* **IDE** ‚Äî what IDE you will use? I personally use PyCharm, but know a lot of people who use VS Code. I know that there are Jupyter notebooks, google colabs. [Deepnote ](https://deepnote.com/)is quite a good tool as well. In fact, they all are nice, but not for proper R&D nowadays. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love Jupyter notebook and use it a lot, but let‚Äôs be honest, it is not IDE, but rather a research prototyping environment. A combination of jupyter notebooks and proper IDE will boost your projects a lot.
* **Frameworks** ‚Äî today there are only two main players in this area: Pytorch and Tensorflow. There are hundreds of comparison articles, and both frameworks are great (some [fresh discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/k6n8m5/d_revisiting_the_tensorflow_vs_pytorch/) on Reddit). Again, just choose what you like the most and never regret it. My choice is Pytorch ‚Äî like it as hell. There also wrappers of these frameworks, I use[ Pytorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) ‚Äî amazing stuff. There is a good [ecosystem around Pytroch](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/) and sometimes I found something interesting and new there. Probably there is a similar thing for Tensorflow (sorry, too lazy to check)
* **Data management** ‚Äî very important and undeservedly ignored by the majority of people. There are amazing speeches of Andrej Karpathy about data importance, very inspiring ‚Äî highly recommend ([this](https://slideslive.com/38917690/multitask-learning-in-the-wilderness) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx7BXih7zx8) ‚Äî they are about a lot of things, tbh, but also about the importance of data). This is one of his slides that tells a lot. I use [DVC](https://dvc.org/) for data version control ‚Äî we also created a [data registry](https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/data-registries) in our team. We keep track of all the changes in original raw data there (adding new data, reannotations, changes). Enjoying it a lot. Nice developing is happening in Activeloop: [Hub](https://github.com/activeloopai/Hub) is interesting solution and worth attention. Important thing: metadata is highly valuable as well. Never underestimate its importance. Data labeling could be a separate chapter, but I decided to put it here. Again, tons of image annotation tools on the market: choose the one that fits your need. We use [supervisely](https://supervise.ly/) at the moment, super convenient in distributed labeling. In general, be prepared to spend a lot of time on data: structuring, cleaning, labeling, visualizations, etc. ‚Äî all that is, in my opinion, way more important than actual straight ML/DL stuff. This is just something you should deal with. So keep calm, and spent time on data. More about data management is [here](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/spring2021/lecture-8/).

&#x200B;

[ I a bit remade the image to make text more visible. ](https://preview.redd.it/byx7dmxjhyv61.png?width=1988&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d9391cd22b23f87d15dd5134d337dae1ce89557)

* **MLOps** ‚Äî something that everyone starts to talk about. To simplify: this is DevOps in the ML area. Probably, DVC can be related here as well. MLops is everything you will need to create a nice infrastructure for your ML projects. That includes experiments tracking, comparing, reproduction, models saving/tracking, CI/CD stuff that you can use. The market is full of free and paid packages. We use [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) and like it a lot. We have an MLFlow server with a minio backend, we store all our team experiments there. At the same time, we have [a Model registry](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html), that helps a lot in production. It gives us version control over the models and an easy way to load them. MLflow is not the only solution, of course. Take a look at others: [W & B](https://wandb.ai/site), [comet](https://www.comet.ml/site/), [neptune](https://neptune.ai/). Also, nice free book: [Introducing MLOps](https://pages.dataiku.com/oreilly-introducing-mlops) from O‚ÄôReilly & DataikuPlus some combination of this and previous bullet points: MLOps: From [Model-centric to Data-centric AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo) lecture from Andrew Ng.

## Let‚Äôs go to the methods and algorithms.

CV is the most advanced field in DL (sorry NLP enthusiasts) and that causes the large variety of cool models/methods. On the other hand, each freaking day there is something new. Still, there are some classical constants that barely change. (in fact, if you are not into fundamental research, you can just choose some proven techniques and they will work. Well, most likely.)

* There are always some SOTA back-bone architectures, and they are quite constant. Resnets are a good baseline, se\_resnexts are usually way better. Efficient nets are also awesome. Unets are a solid choice for segmentation. FasterRCNN, yolos ‚Äî for detection. MaskRCNN for instance segmentation (but usually you want a separate classification part).
* A lot of nice Github repos on models mentioned above. Just google it, and find the one you like (or the one that fits in the current situation). For example, I enjoy this [pytorch segmentation repo](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch). Or this [efficient-net package](https://github.com/lukemelas/EfficientNet-PyTorch).
* Resources ‚Äî first of all, [ml in reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/). All cool stuff ends up being posted there anyway, so this is a must-read resource. Then, Twitter (sorry). I am subscribed to guys like mentioned earlier Andrej Karpathy. Find the ones you respect and believe in and follow them. You can also subscribe to official Pytorch/Tensorflow/You-name-it accounts, they announce and retweet a lot of cool stuff as well. Best courses I‚Äôve seen: from [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) (good DL for coders + SOTA algorithms discussed), [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/) ‚Äî just the best practical course I‚Äôve seen. [Basics of conv nets](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) from Stanford ‚Äî classic. Kaggle is the perfect way to follow on development of the best tricks and techniques (crazy augmentations like mix up, cutmix, tricky loss functions, multi-head networks etc.). The creativeness of sportsmen (and people there are real sportsmen imho) never stops to surprise me. Plus there are usually winning solution blog post, so keep an eye on them

Some words about GPUs

Miners blow the market and GPUs costs like spaceship now. But anyway, there are different options you can use, either you buy your own GPUs or borrow them in the cloud. It is relatively easy to come up with some AWS or Google cloud solutions. Also, in my experience, for most of the tasks, a few 10\*\*/20\*\* are already a solid choice at the beginning. Of course, that depends on the task and data, but most likely you can survive with smaller scales for a while.

&#x200B;

[ But, boi, how satisfactory is it to work with big GPUs. ](https://preview.redd.it/22x8zmplhyv61.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b97920502a4f036490192e38e89d12c80d318b22)

Hope I didn‚Äôt forget anything important!

I wish that could help someone in this crazy world of computer vision.

k1h6nl,Why You Don‚Äôt Need to Learn Machine Learning,"I notice an increasing number of Twitter and LinkedIn influencers preaching why you should start learning Machine Learning and how easy it is once you get started.

While it‚Äôs always great to hear some encouraging words, I like to look at things from another perspective. I don‚Äôt want to sound pessimistic and discourage no one, I‚Äôm just trying to give an objective opinion.

While looking at what these Machine Learning experts (or should I call them influencers?) post, I ask myself, why do some many people wish to learn Machine Learning in the first place?

Maybe the main reason comes from not knowing what do Machine Learning engineers actually do. Most of us don‚Äôt work on Artificial General Intelligence or Self-driving cars.

It certainly isn‚Äôt easy to master Machine Learning as influencers preach. Being ‚ÄúA Jack of all trades and master of none‚Äù also doesn‚Äôt help in this economy.

# Easier to get a Machine Learning job

One thing is for sure and I learned it the hard way. It is harder to find a job as a Machine Learning Engineer than as a Frontend (Backend or Mobile) Engineer.

Smaller startups usually don‚Äôt have the resources to afford an ML Engineer. They also don‚Äôt have the data yet, because they are just starting. Do you know what they need? Frontend, Backend and Mobile Engineers to get their business up and running.

Then you are stuck with bigger corporate companies. Not that‚Äôs something wrong with that, but in some countries, there aren‚Äôt many big companies.

# Higher wages

Senior Machine Learning engineers don‚Äôt earn more than other Senior engineers (at least not in Slovenia).

There are some Machine Learning superstars in the US, but they were in the right place at the right time ‚Äî with their mindset. I‚Äôm sure there are Software Engineers in the US who have even higher wages.

# Machine Learning is future proof

While Machine Learning is here to stay, I can say the same for frontend, backend and mobile development.

If you work as a frontend developer and you‚Äôre satisfied with your work, just stick with it. If you need to make a website with a Machine Learning model, partner with someone that already has the knowledge.

# Machine Learning is Fun

While Machine Learning is fun. It‚Äôs not always fun.

Many think they‚Äôll be working on Artificial General Intelligence or Self-driving cars. But more likely they will be composing the training sets and working on infrastructure.

Many think that they will play with fancy Deep Learning models, tune Neural Network architectures and hyperparameters. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, some do, but not many.

The truth is that ML engineers spend most of the time working on ‚Äúhow to properly extract the training set that will resemble real-world problem distribution‚Äù. Once you have that, you can in most cases train a classical Machine Learning model and it will work well enough.

# Conclusion

I know this is a controversial topic, but as I already stated at the beginning, I don‚Äôt mean to discourage anyone.

If you feel Machine Learning is for you, just go for it. You have my full support. Let me know if you need some advice on where to get started.

But Machine Learning is not for everyone and everyone doesn‚Äôt need to know it. If you are a successful Software Engineer and you‚Äôre enjoying your work, just stick with it. Some basic Machine Learning tutorials won‚Äôt help you progress in your career.

In case you're interested, I wrote an opinion article [5 Reasons You Don‚Äôt Need to Learn Machine Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-reasons-you-dont-need-to-learn-machine-learning-5f9b1ddf8eb5?sk=ff8c0476bd19f3ae32e71f6eefe703d4).

I am sharing a curriculum I created and followed that has helped me transition from a non technical job (marketing) to a career where I am now building deep learning training pipelines, prototyping apps and deploying them online. 

Resources are based on 2 years of constantly searching for the best online materials whether they're a course, a book, a YouTube channel, or even a newsletter. This is the 3rd edition of this curriculum, updated two weeks ago. 

It is intended to be equivalent to a Master degree in Data Science and as an alternative to attending college. It is focused on being practical but without neglecting Math, learning how to code, and also learning how to learn. 

I'd love to hear your feedback and to know if anyone else has made a complete career change from a non technical position?

dd5lvs,After two years of self-study I finally got a job as a data scientist,"I've waited a long time for this day, so I'd like to share it with you. 

I have a rather unconventional background as I am a trained business psychologist. Early in my studies I liked the empirical/statistical subjects and when I finally heard about ML for the first time I knew that I wanted to deal with it professionally in the long run. So I took several online courses (including Professor Ng's Machine Learning Course on coursera and MITx's Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data on edX) and enrolled in a technical university parallel to my business psychology studies to take some additional math and computer science modules.

I submitted my bachelor thesis a few weeks ago and am now a graduate of business psychology. So I started looking for a job right afterwards and to my surprise I was immediately hired by a large company based in Germany. Maybe I was just lucky, but I think the entry threshold wasn't as high as I thought it would be. I don't regret investing so much extra work in my data science education, I think it's just a small milestone and I'll be busy training myself for decades to come. Next year I'll start my Master's in Cognitive Science/AI and from there we'll see where I'll end up.

I would like to wish you all good luck on your own paths!

Susan is an Applied Scientist at **Amazon** and is responsible for building state-of-the-art advertising recommendation systems! Krishna has had a slightly unconventional path to get to this point. His background is in Civil Engineering and he was first a Data Science consultant before joining Amazon. I'm looking forward to having him share his journey and the tips he picked up along the way.

Last session was an absolute blast with over 250 people who attended from all over the world. I hope you see you all there!

With the great collaboration of a friend of mine, we built and deployed a machine learning application to AWS using Python.

To tell you more about this fun journey, we wrote a post where we'll walk you through the steps to:

*  Collect and scrape data with Scrapy / Selenium
* Train a deep character CNN for (English) sentiment analysis using PyTorch
* Build an interactive web app with Dash to serve the model in real-time
* Put everything in Docker Compose
*  Deploy to AWS on a custom domain name

Hey guys, I‚Äôve been doing a lot of preparation for interviews lately, and thought I‚Äôd compile a document of theories, algorithms, and models I found helpful during this time. Originally, I was just keeping notes in a Google Doc, but figured I could create something more permanent and aesthetic.

It covers topics (some more in-depth than others), such as:

* Distributions
* Linear and Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees and Random Forest
* SVM
* KNN
* Clustering
* Boosting
* Dimension Reduction (PCA, LDA, Factor Analysis)
* NLP
* Neural Networks
* Recommender Systems
* Reinforcement Learning
* Anomaly Detection

The four-page Data Science Cheatsheet can be found [here](https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet/blob/main/Data_Science_Cheatsheet.pdf), and I hope it's helpful to those looking to review or brush up on machine learning concepts.

o3ztwb,90% of the truth about ML is inconvenient,"Hey guys! I once discussed with my past colleague that 90% of machine learning specialist work is, actually, engineering. That made me thinking, what other inconvenient or not obvious truths are there about our jobs? So I collected the ones that I experienced or have heard from the others. Some of them are my personal pain, some are just curious remarks. Don‚Äôt take it too serious though.

Maybe this post can help someone to get more insights about the field before diving into it. Or you can find yourself in some of the points, and maybe even write some more.

Original is post is [here](https://irregularadel.substack.com/p/90-of-the-truth-about-ml-is-inconvenient).

[Right?..](https://preview.redd.it/n92t3wfked671.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=acb652d066d813b5db77de4dc1f334f3d97e7496)

# List of inconvenient truth about ML job:

1. 90% of your job won‚Äôt be about training neural networks.¬†
2. 90% of ML specialists can‚Äôt answer (hard) statistical questions.
3. In 90% of cases, you will suffer from dirty and/or small datasets.
4. 90% of model deployment is a pain in the ass. ( . ‚Ä¢ÃÅ \_ ñ ‚Ä¢ÃÄ .)¬†
5. 90% of success comes from the data rather than from the models.
6. For 90% of model training, you don‚Äôt need a lot of super-duper GPUs
7. There are 90% more men in Ml than women (at least what I see).
8. In 90% of cases, your models will fail on real data.
9. 90% of specialists had no ML-related courses in their Universities. (When I was diving into deep learning, there were around 0 courses even online)
10. In large corporations, 90% of your time you will deal with a lot of security-related issues. (like try to use ‚Äúpip install something‚Äù in some oil and gas company, hah)
11. In startups, 90% of your time you will debug models based on users' complaints.
12. In 90% of companies, there are no separate ML teams. But it‚Äôs getting better though.
13. 90% of stakeholders will be skeptical about ML.
14. 90% of your questions are already on StackOverflow (or on some Pytorch forum).

P.S. 90% of this note may not be true

Please, let me know if you want me to elaborate on this list - I can write more extensive stuff on each point. And also feel free to add more of these.

Thanks!

kb94wv,How NOT to learn Machine Learning,"In this thread, I address common missteps when starting with Machine Learning.

In case you're interested, I wrote a longer article about this topic: [How NOT to learn Machine Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-not-to-learn-machine-learning-80ce68f364b0?sk=7c2e65f478b874b8b091ceed0197456a), in which I also share a better way on how to start with ML.

Let me know your thoughts on this.

https://preview.redd.it/z2d3szz3xl461.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25d0e1d5c7eae5cedfa5f2f63ced200ce39fc47f

**These three questions pop up regularly in my inbox:**

* Should I start learning ML bottom-up by building strong foundations with Math and Statistics?
* Or top-down by doing practical exercises, like participating in Kaggle challenges?
* Should I pay for a course from an influencer that I follow?

## Don‚Äôt buy into shortcuts

My opinion differs from various social media influencers, which can allegedly teach you ML in a few weeks (you just need to buy their course).

I‚Äôm going to be honest with you:

>There are no shortcuts in learning Machine Learning.

There are better and worse ways of starting learning it.

Think about it ‚Äî if there would exist a shortcut, then many would be profiting from Machine Learning, but they don‚Äôt.

Many use Machine Learning as a buzz word because it sells well.

Writing and preaching about Machine Learning is much easier than actually doing it. That‚Äôs also the main reason for a spike in social media influencers.

# How long will you need to learn¬†it?

https://preview.redd.it/9uc7jag7xl461.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8ac8051b6b380cd0053ef1f07ef70b7052e72f6

It really depends on your skill set and how quickly you‚Äôll be able to switch your mindset.

Math and statistics become important later (much later). So it shouldn‚Äôt discourage you if you‚Äôre not proficient at it.

Many Software Engineers are good with code but have trouble with a paradigm shift.

>Machine Learning code rarely crashes, even when there‚Äôre bugs. May that be in incorrect training set specification or by using an incorrect model for the¬†problem.

I would say, by using a rule of thumb, you‚Äôll need 1-2 years of part-time studying to learn Machine Learning. Don‚Äôt expect to learn something useful in just two weeks.

# What do I mean by learning Machine Learning?

https://preview.redd.it/rdk22lo8xl461.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33f9eb8cc5511045e147818574c8b3045618c9e8

I need to define what do I mean by ‚Äúlearning Machine Learning‚Äù as learning is a never-ending process.

>As Socrates said: The more I learn, the less I realize I¬†know.

The quote above really holds for Machine Learning. I‚Äôm in my 7th year in the field and I‚Äôm constantly learning new things. You can always go deeper with ML.

**When is it fair to say that you know Machine Learning?**

In my opinion, there are two cases:

* In the first case, you use ML to solve a practical (non-trivial) problem that you couldn‚Äôt solve otherwise. May that be a hobby project or in your work.
* Someone is prepared to pay you for your services.

**When is it NOT fair to say you know Machine Learning?**

Don‚Äôt be that guy that ‚Äúknows‚Äù Machine Learning, because he trained a Neural Network, which (sometimes) correctly separates cats from dogs. Or that guy, who knows how to predict who would survive the Titanic disaster.

Many follow a simple tutorial, which outlines just the cherry on top. There are many important things happening behind the scenes, for which you need time to study and understand.

The guys that ‚Äúknow ML‚Äù above would get lost, if you would just slightly change the problem.

# Money can buy books, but it can‚Äôt buy knowledge

https://preview.redd.it/mzxcduu9xl461.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ac80b86ea53b29fb339fb99f14c327faab36c02

As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, there is more and more educational content about Machine Learning available every day. That also holds for free content, which is many times on the same level as paid content.

To give an answer to the question: Should you buy that course from the influencer you follow?

>Investing in yourself is never a bad investment, but I suggest you look at the free resources first.

# Learn breadth-first, not depth-first

https://preview.redd.it/s4272vzazl461.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a779cfd3efa597090cea776b7be8e50c7bd050da

I would start learning Machine Learning top-down.

It seems counter-intuitive to start learning a new field from high-level concepts and then proceed to the foundations. IMO this is a better way to learn it.

Why? Because when learning from the bottom-up, it‚Äôs not obvious where do complex concepts from Math and Statistics fit into Machine Learning. It gets too abstract.

My advice is (if I put in graph theory terms):

>Try to learn Machine Learning breadth-first, not depth-first.

Meaning, don‚Äôt go too deep into a certain topic, because you‚Äôd get discouraged quickly. Eg. learning concepts of learning theory before training your first Machine Learning model.

When you start learning ML, I also suggest you use multiple resources at the same time.

Take multiple courses. You don‚Äôt need to finish them. One instructor might present a certain concept better than another instructor.

Also don‚Äôt focus just on courses. Try to learn the field more broadly. IMO finishing a course gives you a false feeling of progress. Eg. Maybe a course focuses too deeply on unimportant topics.

While listening to the course, take some time and go through a few notebooks in [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks). This way you‚Äôll get a feel for the practical part of Machine Learning.

Edit: Updated the rule of thumb estimate from 6 months to 1-2 years.

ll3yi3,Struggling With My Masters Due To Depression,"Hi Guys, I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to post this. If not then I apologise and the mods can delete this. I just don‚Äôt know where to go or who to ask. 

For some background information, I‚Äôm a 27 year old student who is currently studying for her masters in artificial intelligence. Now to give some context, my background is entirely in education and philosophy. I applied for AI because I realised that teaching wasn‚Äôt what I wanted to do and I didn‚Äôt want to be stuck in retail for the rest of my life. 

Before I started this course, the only Python I knew was the snake kind. Some background info on my mental health is that I have severe depression and anxiety that I am taking sertraline for and I‚Äôm on a waiting list to start therapy. 

My question is that since I‚Äôve started my masters, I‚Äôve struggled. One of the things that I‚Äôve struggled with the most is programming. Python is the language that my course has used for the AI course and I feel as though my command over it isn‚Äôt great. I know this is because of a lack of practice and it scares me because the coding is the most basic part of this entire course. I feel so overwhelmed when I even try to attempt to code. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I don‚Äôt know how I can find the discipline or motivation to make an effort and not completely fail my masters. 

When I started this course, I believed that this was my chance at a do over and to finally maybe have a career where I‚Äôm not treated like some disposable trash. 

I‚Äôm sorry if this sounds as though I‚Äôm rambling on, I‚Äôm just struggling and any help or suggestions will be appreciated.",409,67,ALostKashmiri,2021-02-16 13:38:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/ll3yi3/struggling_with_my_masters_due_to_depression/,0,learnmachinelearning

&#x200B;

The mods of /r/learnmachinelearning are creating this megathread to aggregate all future posts related to recent scandals involving Siraj Raval for the following reasons:

&#x200B;

1. Raise awareness: if you were curious why Siraj Raval is discussed, hopefully this thread can help you get back on the loop
2. Use as a future reference post: Should someone ask about Siraj Raval or post his materials in the future, you can reference this post
3. Stop witch hunting: Yes, he has done some wrongdoings, but we do not need entire subreddit disparaging him.
4. Prevent posts about/against him burying other educational posts in /r/lml: Perhaps the most important reason. I see the large portion of the /r/LML front page occupied about him . While it's important to know where \*not\* to get education, it's also hindering the original goal of learning machine learning.

&#x200B;

Effective from the creation of this post, please redirect all posts about Siraj Raval into this thread as a comment instead. Any future posts about Siraj Raval will be deleted. If you see any posts created after this about Siraj Raval, please flag it so mods can take the appropriate actions.

mbhfso,Advanced Takeaways from fast.ai book,"I recently read the Fast AI deep learning [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50204643-deep-learning-for-coders-with-fastai-and-pytorch) and wanted to summarise some of the many advanced takeaways & tricks I got from it.  I‚Äôm going to leave out the basic things because there‚Äôs enough posts about them, i‚Äôm just focusing on what I found new or special in the book.

I‚Äôve also put the insights into a [deck](https://saveall.ai/shared/deck/140&4&3K3uXPazkg4) on save all to help you remember them over the long-term. I would **massively recommend using a spaced repetition app (video** [**explanation**](https://youtu.be/AD0aFdRCskQ)**) like anki or** [**save all**](https://saveall.ai/) **for the things you learn** otherwise you‚Äôll just forget so much of what is important. Here‚Äôs the takeaways:

# Neural Network Training Fundamentals

* Always **start** an ML project by **producing simple baselines**
   * If is binary classification then could even be as simple as predicting the most common class in the training dataset
   * Other baselines: linear regression, random forest, boosting etc‚Ä¶
* Then you can **use your baseline to clean your data** by looking at the datapoints it gets most incorrect and checking to see if they are actually classified correctly in the data
* In general you can also **leverage your baselines** to **help debug** your models
   * e.g. if you make your neural network 1 layer then it should be able to match the performance of a linear regression baseline, if it doesn‚Äôt then you have a bug!
   * e.g. if adding a feature improves the performance of linear regression then it should probably also improve the performance of your neural net unless you have a bug!
* Hyperparameter optimisation can help a bit (especially for the learning rate) but in general there are default hyperparameters that can do quite well and so **closely** **optimising the hyperparameters should be one of the last things you try** rather than the first
* **If you know something** about the problem then try to **inject it as an inductive bias into the training process**
   * e.g. if some of your features are related in a sequential way then incorporate them into training separately using an RNN
   * e.g. if you know the output should only be between -3 and 3 then use sigmoid to design the final layer so that it forces the output of the network to be in this range

# Transfer Learning

* Always use transfer learning if you can by finding a model pre-trained for a similar task and then fine-tune that model for your particular task
   * e.g. see [huggingface](http://huggingface.co/) for help with this in NLP
* **Gradual unfreezing** and **discriminative learning rates** work well when fine-tuning a transfer learned model
   * **Gradual unfreezing** = freeze earlier layers and **train the later layers only**, then **gradually unfreeze** the earlier layers one by one
   * **Discriminative learning rates** = having **different learning rates per layer of your network** (usually **earlier** **layers** have **smaller learning rates** than later layers)

# Tricks to Deal with Overfitting

* **Best way** to deal with **overfitting** is by getting **more data**. **Exhaust this first** before you start regularising with other methods
* **Data augmentation** is really powerful and now possible with text as well as images:
   * **Image** data augmentation -  crop, pad, squish and resize images
   * **Text** data augmentation - negate words, replace words with similes, perturb word embeddings (nice github [repo](https://github.com/QData/TextAttack) for this)
* **Mixup regularisation** = create new data by averaging together training datapoints
* **Backwards training (NLP only):** train an additional separate model that is **fed text backwards** and then **average the outputs** of your two models to get your final prediction

# Other Tricks to Improve Performance

* **Test time augmentation** = at test time, use the **average prediction** from many **augmented versions of the input** as your prediction rather than just the prediction from the true input
* **1 cycle training** = when you increase and reduce the learning rate throughout training in a circular fashion (usually makes a **huge difference)**
* **Learning rate finder algorithm** = algorithm that Fast AI provide to help you automatically discover roughly the best learning rate
* **Never use one-hot encodings,** use **embeddings** instead, even in **tabular data**!
* Using **AdamW** instead of **Adam** can help a little bit
* **Lower precision training** can help and on [pytorch lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) is just a simple flag you can set
* For **regression problems** if you know the **output should be within a range** then its good to use **sigmoid** to force the neural net output to be within this range
   * I.e. make the network output:  min\_value + sigmoid(output) \* (max\_value - min\_value)
* **Clustering** your features can help you **identify which ones are the most redundant** and then removing the can help performance
* **Label smoothing** = use 0.1 and 0.9 instead of 0 and 1 for label targets (can smoothen training)
* **Don‚Äôt dichotomise** your data, if your output is continuous then its better to train the network to predict continuous values rather than turning it into a classification problem
* **Progressive resizing** = train model on smaller resolution images first, then increase resolution gradually (can speed up training a lot)
* Strategically using **bottleneck layers** to force the network to form **more compact representations of the data** at different points can be helpful
* Try using **skip connections** as they can help smooth out the loss surface

&#x200B;

js8e8e,Don‚Äôt Repeat These Mistakes with SQL,"SQL and Machine Learning have a few things in common. It‚Äôs easy to start with one as it doesn‚Äôt require a lot of coding. Also, code rarely crashes.

I would argue that the fact that the SQL queries don‚Äôt crash makes the Data Analysis even harder. How many datasets I‚Äôve extracted from the database, that turned out to have wrong or missing data? Many!

# 1. Not knowing in what order queries execute

[SQL query execution order](https://preview.redd.it/ncty0v0e7my51.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cfa8f55df0828f3ef61534b78d8668bfc7615a3)

SQL has a low barrier to entry. You start writing queries ‚Äî use a JOIN here and there, do some grouping and you‚Äôre already an expert (at least some people think so).

**But does the so-called expert even know in what order do SQL queries execute?**

SQL queries don‚Äôt start with SELECT ‚Äî they do in the editor when we write them, but the database doesn‚Äôt start with SELECT.

The database starts executing queries with FROM and JOIN. That‚Äôs why we can use fields from JOINed tables in WHERE.

Why can‚Äôt we filter the result of GROUP BY in WHERE? Because GROUP BY executes after WHERE. Hence, the reason for HAVING.

At last, we come to SELECT. It selects which columns to include and defines which aggregations to calculate. Also, Window Functions execute here.

This explains why we get an error when we try to filter with the output of a Window Function in WHERE.

# 2. What do Window Functions actually do?

[Example of a transformation with a SUM Window Function](https://preview.redd.it/jxz0203i7my51.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=b04a2a8be6a2e73493a00137cddae123fae43ee6)

Window Functions seemed cryptic to me when I first encountered them. Why use Window Functions as GROUP BY can aggregate the data?

Well, a Window Function (WF) simplifies many operations when designing queries:

* WF allows access to the records right before and after the current record. See Lead and Lag functions.
* WF can perform an additional aggregation on already aggregated data with GROUP BY. See the example in the image above, where I calculate sales all with a WF.
* ROW\_NUMBER WF enumerates the rows. We can also use it to remove duplicate records with it. Or to take a random sample.
* As the name suggests WF can calculate statistics on a given window:

&#x200B;

    sum(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID BY ts ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as cumulative_sum

The WF above would calculate the cumulative sum from the first record to the current record.

**Where did I do a mistake with Window Functions?**

I didn‚Äôt take the time for a tutorial that would explain the basics and the power of Window Functions. Consequently, I avoided them and the queries became overcomplicated. Then bugs creep in.

**Run the example**

I got many requests from readers that would like to play with the example above. Now, you can run the example online in [SQL Fiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/#!15/9eecb7db59d16c80417c72d1e1f4fbf1/35342).

[Tree of the Deep Learning course, yellow rectangles are course, orange rectangles are colab, and circles are anki cards.](https://preview.redd.it/t7c4b2fr27381.jpg?width=944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bb914a55959f961309173333fb849ad82a1fe7a)

We start from the basics, what is a neuron, how to do a forward & backward pass, and gradually step up to cover the majority of computer vision done by deep learning.

In each course, you have extensive slides, a lot of resources to read, google colab tutorials (with answers hidden so you'll never be stuck!), and to finish [Anki cards](https://ankiweb.net/) to do spaced-repetition and not to forget what you've learned :)

The course is very up-to-date, you'll even learn about research papers published this November! But there also a lot of information about the good old models.

Tell me if you liked, and don't hesitate to give me feedback to improve it!

Happy learning,

Just this week I started a new job in a company that is very experienced in ML. I think that I got lucky on technical interviews. I just got a task to basically run some data through the model they have, do the preprocessing etc. and I feel completely overwhelmed by the codebase and the task.

I am posting all my recorded lecture videos to YouTube this semester. It's the most robust platform I found for sharing video material and embedding it into my classroom modules. A nice side-effect is that others may find them helpful as well :). 

The course is an intro to ML course (most students taking this course are new to ML). There will be a balance between concepts and coding (I will walk through several coding examples in this course using Python).

Long story short: Here's the playlist in case you find it useful (of course, more content will be added over time / on a weekly basis) :)

A  lot of beginner tutorials out there for using machine learning don't really go beyond copy-pasting some sample code off the Tensorflow website and running it through an overused benchmark dataset.

So  I thought I would describe a viable sequence for carrying a machine  learning product through a more realistic lifecycle from **initial idea** to a **deployed solution**.

The domain is fake news detection and in a series of blog posts I describe:

\- project setup

\- exploratory data analysis

\- building a training/evaluation pipeline

\- error analysis

\- deploying a server and creating a Chrome extension for browser-side interaction

\- building a continuous integration/deployment solution.

Here's the [first post in the series](https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/setting-up-a-machine-learning-project/) and [associated source code](https://github.com/mihail911/fake-news).

* Added Statistics
* Added A/B Testing
* Improved Distribution Section
* Added Multi-class SVM
* Added HMM 
* Miscellaneous Section

n397hw,We're building a platform to efficiently learn machine learning,"Online education is slow and frustrating. 

We're building a graph-based platform for educational content that learns to recommend you the best content based on your knowledge and goals. It's faster, more engaging, and improves as you use it. 

We are very early stage and are looking for signals of interest: If you want this to exist, [sign up here](https://learney.me).

And can read more about what we're building here: [https://henry-pulver.medium.com/the-future-of-online-learning-for-knowledge-work-cb9608f9bc1a](https://henry-pulver.medium.com/the-future-of-online-learning-for-knowledge-work-cb9608f9bc1a)

The basic logic is:

# Courses don't make sense online

Educational content is almost always structured as a course. These siloed linear structures cannot take your current knowledge into account. While it's convenient for providers to package content this way, for the user this means:

* Time wasted restudying material you already know
* Starting content at the wrong difficulty level

# Another way is now possible

Two huge changes mean a more efficient way of learning online has recently become possible. Enormous quantities of educational content is now freely available, and machine learning enables curation of content that is right for you. ***However, as everything is currently packaged as a course, a newly structured platform is required to deliver this.***

We are building a platform structured as a network, with nodes being concepts and edges being dependencies. Here's what that enables:

* Association of each concept (node) with the best educational content from across the internet
* Help you visualise a new area quickly based on the network structure
* Find the best content for a specific idea quickly
* Show you what you need to know before you're able to understand that idea
* Increase knowledge retention through regular questioning on the topics that matter to you

And here's an example of how it saves time when learning a topic you'll all know about, linear algebra: 

&#x200B;

[How Learney saves you time](https://preview.redd.it/xf6wflr1aqw61.png?width=2481&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1eec45517914ef84467f108a4e67169312f3912)

Rather than take the whole linear algebra course, Learney can compute the most efficient path you learning what you need to know. 

# Long term vision

We aim to have questions associated with each node for you to test your knowledge in that area, and apply techniques such as spaced repetition to maximise knowledge retention. We also aim to have associated coding exercises with datasets if relevant. 

While we are starting with machine learning, we envisage this platform being the central hub for online learning, allowing you to track your knowledge, find the best content for achieving your learning goals, and ensure knowledge retention.

Overall we aim to build an adaptive learning system for online education. JOIN US!",365,33,Ok-Craft-9908,2021-05-02 15:51:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/n397hw/were_building_a_platform_to_efficiently_learn/,1,learnmachinelearning

**Test your skills by implementing a use case from scratch**. Without using any ready-made resources or instructions. From data collection, data preparation & understanding, modeling, training, optimization to a robust pipeline. Be able to explain and interpret what you have realized. **Try to visualize it and describe it to someone who is not an expert.

gudqiz,The (temporarily free) Coursera machine learning guided projects are pretty helpful,"For those who didn't know, Coursera is allowing people to get one free guided project of their choice. Basically, it's a project that's spoonfeed to you by the instructor though a cloud desktop. It's a short 1-2 hour tutorial, and you get a certificate. It's usually ten bucks.   [https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=guided+projects&index=prod\_all\_products\_term\_optimization&skills=Machine+Learning](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=guided+projects&index=prod_all_products_term_optimization&skills=Machine+Learning) 

I've just started to take Andrew Ng's machine learning course, so I decided to take one of the beginner machine learning projects. I took one about multiple linear regression .  [https://www.coursera.org/projects/scikit-learn-multiple-linear-regression?](https://www.coursera.org/projects/scikit-learn-multiple-linear-regression?)  Unlike the coursera course, it didn't go deep into the theory, and went straight to the applications. It was helpful, because it taught Python and its libraries, while the machine learning course only teaches Octave and MATLAB, and it reinforced what I learned in class. 

I wouldn't normally buy it for the ten dollar price, since it's very short. If you're just starting out like me, I highly recommend it while it's free. It's free until the 12th, and you have to add it to your cart, and then it should show it as 0 cents.",355,37,Comfooder,2020-06-01 04:16:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/gudqiz/the_temporarily_free_coursera_machine_learning/,0,learnmachinelearning

I have been working as DS for the last 3 years in two different companies. I have never studied a course on machine learning, but I'm good at math, statistics, and coding. Today I took LinkedIn's Machine Learning assessment and failed. To be honest, it felt pretty bad, because I believed that I had a good understanding of almost all ML topics, and also because the questions were not so difficult. Until today I had some impostor syndrome, but after failing the test that feeling has grown a lot.

What do you recommend me to do? Should I take some ML courses to improve my knowledge of those topics?

ogw1c0,I'm learning algorithms and I'm blown away by their awesomeness,"I've been a data scientist for several years. I know how to apply machine learning tools in different contexts and I've run numerous large scale projects. Recently I've been studying discrete math and classical CS algorithms. It's amazing how much you can do with decades-old ideas! 

I was working on an NP-Hard problem and thought I'd have to come up with a complicated model to even get close to a solution. Instead, I find an old approach that was good enough for my purposes. The people who invented it had access to such weak computers that they had to be clever. 

It's a shame that there's such a divide between the education of most DS and CS practitioners.

jiw1jd,Code marathon for writing machine learning and deep learning code until Christmas,"\-----MAJOR UPDATE GUYS-----After receiving so many messages and comments, putting the link again. Once you join the server you will have to do this, you will also read this in the welcome channel when you join:

1. It will be really helpful if you can put a one liner here about yourself.
2. What kind of projects you want to work on. Where you want to spend much of your time (for example I will be doing NLP).
3. Post that you can message privately to people who have similar intertests or whom you want to make a group with.
4. We will proceed with groups of 5-8 people.
5. Once you have decided to make a group, please let the moderators know.We will create separate channel for you.
6. After people are divided into groups you can either follow and standard blueprint that I am creating that I am interested in, you can create your own discussing it with your group, take from another group etc.We will try to keep weekly live streams where one person from a group will coding something live for others to learn and ask doubts.Inter and Intra group collaboration processes to be decided yet.Link: [https://discord.gg/EsrDePp](https://discord.gg/EsrDePp)

&#x200B;

\-----Original Post------Hi all, I am doing a code marathon for polishing my ML and DL skills. If you are a beginner and are done with some basic courses, this might be helpful for you. Some things you can expect from the marathon:

* EDA on different datasets.
* Preprocessing data for better performing models.
* Experiments with plotting libraries and different mathematical graphs.

Let me know if you want to tag along. I will create a discord server.

Edit: Thanks guys for the response, I will share the discord details here. Planning to start this by 1st  Nov until Christmas. Also, I am looking for people to help with this, get in DMs if you have ideas.

Edit2: Thanks guys for the overwhelming response. I was not expecting these many people being interested. I will create a discord server at night and have simple channels made for discussions and intros. I will work on a methodology on how to do this properly and better meanwhile, all suggestions are welcome. Will start coding on 1st of November. Really excited for this.

Edit3: Hi guys, created this Discord channel: \[removed\] Feel free to join, there is nothing much there yet. Just introductions and collecting idea on how to do this better, frankly wasn't expecting these many responses. Feel think a little bit more about how to do this before we actually start coding form 1st Nov. Until then join the disco, Introduce yourselves. Happy learning!

Edit4: Hi guys, We had a lot of people joining in so disabled the link for now. Will come up with some concrete processes first and then add more people soon.

eh7qef,Why 100 Days of ML Code Challenge is great,"I am on Day 27 today and I'm quite convinced already that consistent efforts, however small, can help someone go a long way. I've been wanting to actively pursue Machine Learning and Data Science for more than a year now but haven't been consistent and usually forget after 3-4 days. 

The challenge includes posting what you do on your social media handles so that you stay more committed to this challenge. After a few days, the habit sticks and you simply can't go to sleep without learning something. I've had a few very busy and tiring days too in these 27 days, but I've made sure I did something at least in those days. I'd strongly recommend anyone who's passionate about Machine Learning to take up this challenge. 

I post my challenge details in the blog below, on Github, on Twitter, and my projects on Linkedin.
https://hitheshai.blogspot.com

Here's a summary of how much I was able to learn because of this challenge in 25 Days. Also, getting best wishes from Josh Starmer on one of my Twitter posts (a scholar who runs Statquest channel on YouTube, one of the best in the genre) was a great deal of encouragement. 

(Note: In my version of this challenge, I don't necessarily have to code everyday because of college and other commitments. Some days, even watching a single YouTube video might be sufficient as long as I make some progress from the previous day.)

Completed two MOOCs on Coursera

gozj4h,Important of Linear Regression,"I've seen many junior data scientists and data science aspirants disregard linear regression as a very simple machine learning algorithm. All they care about is deep learning and neural networks and their practical implementations. They think that y=mx+b is all there is to linear regression as in fitting a line to the data. But what they don't realize is it's much more than that, not only it's an excellent machine learning algorithm but it also forms a basis to advanced algorithms such as ANNs. 

I've spoken with many data scientists and even though they know the formula y=mx+b, they don't know how to find the values of the slope(m) and the intercept(b). Please don't do this make sure you understand the underlying math behind linear regression and how it's derived before moving on to more advanced ML algorithms, and try using it for one of your projects where there's a co-relation between features and target. I guarantee that the results would be better than expected. Don't think of Linear Regression as a Hello World of ML but rather as an important pre-requisite for learning further.

Hope this post increases your awareness about Linear Regression and it's importance in Machine Learning.",331,78,rtthatbrownguy,2020-05-23 05:32:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/gozj4h/important_of_linear_regression/,0,learnmachinelearning

ov5sbr,Your daily dose of machine learning,">This is a series of posts that I post almost daily on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nour-islam-mokhtari-07b521a5/) and now I am sharing them here as well. I call them ""*your daily dose of machine learning*"".

Here's an ML interview question for you.

What is high bias in deep learning and how do you know that your neural network has a high bias?

‚û°Ô∏è A high bias in deep learning means that your neural network is underfitting the training data. Which means that your neural network is not learning a complex enough model.

An example of this would be : you want to build a classifier that can separate between 2 classes. These 2 classes look like the image below.

So instead of learning a CIRCULAR boundary, your neural network will learn a LINEAR boundary.

Empirically, if your training accuracy is much lower than human-level accuracy then you have a high bias (or underfitting).

Possible solution? Make your neural network more complex by adding more layers for example.

10fw2df,GPT-4 Will Be 500x Smaller Than People Think - Here Is Why,"&#x200B;

[Number Of Parameters GPT-3 vs. GPT-4](https://preview.redd.it/yio0v3zqgyca1.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2ee034ce7ed48c9adc1793bfdb495e0f0812609)

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That‚Äôs a *trillion* with a ‚Äút‚Äù.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI‚Äôs new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger ‚Äî fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let‚Äôs go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): ‚ÄúFrom talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters‚Äù.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there‚Äôs a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community‚Äôs understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: ‚ÄúScaling Laws For Neural Language Models‚Äù.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind‚Äôs 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): ‚ÄúTraining Compute-Optimal Large Language Models‚Äù

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!  
The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ‚Äã[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails‚Äã

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

geuukb,Want to learn ML by applying it to Games? I'll personally call you weekly and make sure you do it!,"Hi everyone, my name‚Äôs Chris! I‚Äôm a research software engineer with a focus on applying machine learning techniques to a variety of new inventions. I‚Äôm also the co-founder and current co-lead of my company‚Äôs machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) community of practice.

In my free time, I apply ML to games in many different ways. My projects so far mainly have to do with Old School Runescape (examples below but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm here for today). I‚Äôm here today because a few people have reached out to me recently about starting their own projects applying ML to various games and I think that‚Äôs a great idea!! After all, the best way to learn is through implementation and why not implement something you care about? Not to mention, personal projects look great on any resume!

Throughout my journey, I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôm happiest when helping people out by thinking through their process with them and figuring out what comes next. I would really like to share my experience and expertise gained with anyone who is interested in making their own projects and learning much more about ML and its applications in the process. I also have a bunch of ideas for ML-game projects that I‚Äôll never have the time to implement myself which someone else might find invigorating.

That said, I‚Äôm thinking of starting what I‚Äôll call the Chronic Coder Academy. I‚Äôll start with a few students who I personally call on a weekly basis for about 30 minutes to an hour to discuss their new or ongoing ML projects - weekly todos, potential resources and next steps. I personally think it‚Äôd help keep people accountable on their personal journey learning ML and also keep them motivated if I direct them well instead of being lost in the rough sea of ML/AI.

This is targeted at people who care about games and also want to learn more about ML through application. Your age, race, gender, ethnicity, etc mean nothing to me but you have to be passionate about what you do and hopefully converse well enough in English. Everything you make is completely your own, no matter how much advice or guidance I end up giving. Oh and also, it‚Äôs completely free (before anyone asks). I‚Äôm really in this to better expose myself to different applications and ideas plus I truly enjoy watching people learn especially from interesting use cases like these. If they will allow me, I might use their projects as examples for teaching people more about specific ML concepts in the future. All that said, please fill out this survey if you‚Äôre interested: [https://forms.gle/W37tzNFsTCFXGEwMA](https://forms.gle/W37tzNFsTCFXGEwMA)

If this isn‚Äôt for you at this point in your life, feel free to join our discord! This applies regardless of who you are, what you do or what your experience level is. It‚Äôs an amazing community of ML experts and curious students alike who also happen to share a love for games. We could always use more experts to help anyone in need but also it‚Äôs a place to learn if you‚Äôre doing your own applied ML project and aren‚Äôt sure who to go to. Join us here: [https://discord.gg/ZummSXK](https://discord.gg/ZummSXK)

Oh and if you‚Äôre looking for a job sometime soon and worried about a project involving games not being a series enough topic to get hired, I previously did some asking around: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tU2GxQ3SZJVjV8\_A\_PwJBlrQf1tGO1mN0n9YIYLnlSg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tU2GxQ3SZJVjV8_A_PwJBlrQf1tGO1mN0n9YIYLnlSg/edit?usp=sharing). Looks like most professionals agree that ML applied to games can be as serious a topic as any other within the ML field.

Whew that was a long piece... Thank you for reading if you've made it this far!

or **TL;DR** \- I want to help people learn ML by applying it to games. I intend to personally call them on a weekly basis to discuss progress and next steps. Fill out the form above if you‚Äôre interested!

**EDIT**: Firstly, THANK YOU FOR MY FIRST GOLD.

On the topic of when you can expect a response, I'll read through every submission by the end of the week and I'll let you guys know who I decide to start off working with by this weekend (05/10/2020). Probably a max of 5 individuals who I will reach out to once chosen.

The goal is to have a variety of different projects each from different games the individuals are passionate about. This is to hopefully allow for a broader scope of projects that ALL of you can contribute to as well. I plan to make a discord text channel for each game that we're going to be working on. There, we can all discuss ideas, issues and breakthroughs of applying ML to the chosen game. To be clear, these channels are not just for the main project that we'll be working on with the CCA Fellows (which you can contribute as well) but also for your own project ideas that you can work through alongside other ongoing projects that are different but still focused on that specific game.  So please join the discord if you're interested with working on these projects!

I know I will not be able to reach all of you due to the overwhelming response (once again, thank you so much!). However, I still definitely believe in the power of learning through application. Therefore, even if I can't get to you all personally, I hope you still get started on your own by either contributing to the main projects or with your own ML+Game projects. If you do, please keep us up to date as well on the channels we'll create for the games. We'll make sure to check in and, even if it's not a long personal call, that'll definitely still be a way to keep you accountable and continuously learning!",329,27,chriskok1337,2020-05-06 23:10:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/geuukb/want_to_learn_ml_by_applying_it_to_games_ill/,1,learnmachinelearning

üîµ Eigenvectors üîµ  


üöÄ An eigenvector is a special vector associated with a linear transform. It's special in the sense that after applying the said transform it does not change direction but only gets scaled (multiplied by a scalar value) by the eigenvalue.  


üî® Each eigenvector comes with a corresponding scalar called the eigenvalue. Breaking a matrix M into its eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors is called eigendecomposition.  


üî≠ The word ""Eigenvector"" comes from ""eigen"" in German where it means ""its own"". It was originally used to study rigid body motion and in the discovery of principal axes. However, nowadays it has found its way into a wide array of applications from my favorite: principal component analysis, differential equations, and problems in physics and chemistry relating to wave transport and molecular orbitals.  


üé≠ Another one of the classical applications is the Eigenfaces project for facial recognition. Eigenfaces decompose a face as a composition of face templates (basis) called eigenfaces. Imagine N eigenfaces E\_1, ..., E\_n when given a new face F it can be written as a composition of each of these N eigenfaces for example: F = (10% of E\_1 + 55% of E\_2 + 35% of E\_3). Each eigenface would represent a meaningful feature in the high-dimensional space of faces.

nwkamt,Best practices for learning Machine Learning,"Hi all,

I want to compile a list of best practices for learning data science. A list of things that you'd tell yourself if you could go back in time to when you were starting from scratch. What is relevant, what is not.

I have started a list, but I want to discuss it with the community and curate it with your help.

1. Before you start, get a solid math and prob/stats core. It's not so important to be able to proof a theorem, but you should know your way around matrices and vectors and intuitively undersand probabilities
2. Learn either Python or R and their data handling packages (Pandas and Numpy for Python, data.table/dplyr for R) and learn them well. Most of your time will be spent working with these tools
3. Try to learn code good practices. This could take a whole post, a quick summary would be: use descriptive names for variables, columns and functions; don't repeat code (use functions instead); understandable code is better than compact one (10 lines everybody understands > 2 lines nobody understands); don't overoptimize your code at the start, but know where the bottlenecks are in case you need it to scale
4. You don't need to learn all fancy models out there. For basic tasks linear regression is surprisingly effective. XGBoost is one of the most effective models for tabular data. Only learn/use neural nets for image, NLP or some other very specific domain
5. Once you know the basics and understand them well, it's mostly about doing projects
6. When learning a new topic, doing tutorial projects or understanding projects done by others is very helpful
7. You can learn everything online for free. But paying may give you other things other than knowledge (credentials, a class of peers, in some courses better resouces)
8. Explaining your work to others is a great way to consolidate your knowledge
9. Nobody gets it right the first time. Trial and error is the way to go, especially on fields like this where there is no one exact solution
10. The internet is full of helpful and generous people, if you're struggling with something search and if you don't find the answers, ask in the forums (reddit or stackoverflow)
11. Don't focus only on the purely technical, try to understand what is really behind the problems you're modeling

What do you think is missing from the list?

What would you add?

kifqtc,Study Plan for Learning Data Science Over the Next 12 Months [D],"In this thread, I address a study plan for 2021.

In case you're interested, I wrote a whole article about this topic: [Study Plan for Learning Data Science Over the Next 12 Months](https://www.datasource.ai/en/data-science-articles/study-plan-for-learning-data-science-over-the-next-12-months)

Let me know your thoughts on this.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/emg20nzhet661.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf09e4dc5e82ba2fd7b57c706ba2873be57fe8de

We are ending 2020 and it is time to make plans for next year, and one of the most important plans and questions we must ask is what do we want to study?, what do we want to enhance?, what changes do we want to make?, and what is the direction we are going to take (or continue) in our professional careers?.

Many of you will be starting on the road to becoming a data scientist, in fact you may be evaluating it, since you have heard a lot about it, but you have some doubts, for example about the amount of job offers that may exist in this area, doubts about the technology itself, and about the path you should follow, considering the wide range of options to learn.

I‚Äôm a believer that we should learn from various sources, from various mentors, and from various formats. By sources I mean the various virtual platforms and face-to-face options that exist to study. By mentors I mean that it is always a good idea to learn from different points of view and learning from different teachers/mentors, and by formats I mean the choices between books, videos, classes, and other formats where the information is contained.

When we extract information from all these sources we reinforce the knowledge learned, but we always need a guide, and this post aims to give you some practical insights and strategies in this regard.

To decide on sources, mentors and formats it is up to you to choose. It depends on your preferences and ease of learning: for example, some people are better at learning from books, while others prefer to learn from videos. Some prefer to study on platforms that are practical (following online code), and others prefer traditional platforms: like those at universities (Master‚Äôs Degree, PHDs or MOOCs). Others prefer to pay for quality content, while others prefer to look only for free material. That‚Äôs why I won‚Äôt give a specific recommendation in this post, but I‚Äôll give you the whole picture: **a study plan**.

To start you should consider the time you‚Äôll spend studying and the depth of learning you want to achieve, because if you find yourself without a job you could be available full time to study, which is a huge advantage. On the other hand, if you are working, you‚Äôll have less time and you‚Äôll have to discipline yourself to be able to have the time available in the evenings, mornings or weekends. Ultimately, the important thing is to meet the goal of learning and perhaps dedicating your career to this exciting area!

We will divide the year into quarters as follows

* **First Quarter**: Learning the Basics
* **Second Quarter**: Upgrading the Level: Intermediate Knowledge
* **Third Quarter**: A Real World Project ‚Äî A Full-stack Project
* **Fourth Quarter**: Seeking Opportunities While Maintaining Practice

# First Quarter: Learning the Basics

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u7t9bthket661.png?width=998&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ad29cb43618e7acf793259243aa5a60a8535f0a

If you want to be more rigorous you can have start and end dates for this period of study of the bases. It could be something like: From January 1 to March 30, 2021 as deadline. During this period you will study the following:

## A programming language that you can apply to data science: Python or R.

We recommend Python due to the simple fact that approximately 80% of data science job offers ask for knowledge in Python. That same percentage is maintained with respect to the real projects you will find implemented in production. And we add the fact that Python is multipurpose, so you won‚Äôt ‚Äúwaste‚Äù your time if at some point you decide to focus on web development, for example, or desktop development. This would be the first topic to study in the first months of the year.

## Familiarize yourself with statistics and mathematics.

There is a big debate in the data science community about whether we need this foundation or not. I will write a post later on about this, but the reality is that you **DO** need it, but **ONLY** the basics (at least in the beginning). And I want to clarify this point before continuing.

We could say that data science is divided in two big fields: Research on one side and putting Machine Learning algorithms into production on the other side. If you later decide to focus on Research then you are going to need mathematics and statistics in depth (very in depth). If you are going to go for the practical part, the libraries will help you deal with most of it, under the hood. It should be noted that most job offers are in the practical part.

For both cases, and in this first stage you will only need the basics of:

* **Statistics (with Python and NumPy)**

1. Descriptive statistics
2. Inferential Statistics
3. Hypothesis testing
4. Probability

* **Mathematics (with Python and NumPy)**

1. Linear Algebra (For example: SVD)
2. Multivariate Calculus
3. Calculus (For example: gradient descent)

**Note**: We recommend that you study Python first before seeing statistics and mathematics, because the challenge is to implement these statistical and mathematical bases with Python. Don‚Äôt look for theoretical tutorials that show only slides or statistical and/or mathematical examples in Excel/Matlab/Octave/SAS and other different to Python or R, it gets very boring and impractical! You should choose a course, program or book that teaches these concepts in a practical way and using Python. Remember that Python is what we finally use, so you need to choose well. **This advice is key so you don‚Äôt give up on this part, as it will be the most dense and difficult**.

If you have these basics in the first three months, you will be ready to make a leap in your learning for the next three months.

# Second Quarter: Upgrading the Level: Intermediate Knowledge

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y1y55vynet661.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd3e12bb112943025c39a8975faf4d64514df275

If you want to be more rigorous you can have start and end dates for this period of study at the intermediate level. It could be something like: From April 1 to June 30, 2021 as deadline.

Now that you have a good foundation in programming, statistics and mathematics, it is time to move forward and learn about the great advantages that Python has for applying data analysis. For this stage you will be focused on:

## Data science Python stack

Python has the following libraries that you should study, know and practice at this stage

* **Pandas**: for working with tabular data and make in-depth analysis
* **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: for data visualization

Pandas is the in-facto library for data analysis, it is one of the most important (if not the most important) and powerful tools you should know and master during your career as a data scientist. Pandas will make it much easier for you to manipulate, cleanse and organize your data.

## Feature Engineering

Many times people don‚Äôt go deep into Feature Engineering, but if you want to have Machine Learning models that make good predictions and improve your scores, spending some time on this subject is invaluable!

Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data using data mining techniques. These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering can be considered as applied machine learning itself. To achieve the goal of good feature engineering you must know the different techniques that exist, so it is a good idea to at least study the main ones.

## Basic Models of Machine Learning

At the end of this stage you will start with the study of Machine Learning. This is perhaps the most awaited moment! This is where you start to learn about the different algorithms you can use, which particular problems you can solve and how you can apply them in real life.

The Python library we recommend you to start experimenting with ML is: scikit-learn. *However it is a good idea that you can find tutorials where they explain the implementation of the algorithms (at least the simplest ones) from scratch with Python, since the library could be a ‚Äú****Black Box****‚Äù and you might not understand what is happening under the hood. If you learn how to implement them with Python, you can have a more solid foundation*.

If you implement the algorithms with Python (without a library), you will put into practice everything seen in the statistics, mathematics and Pandas part.

These are some recommendations of the algorithms that you should at least know in this initial stage

* **Supervised learning**
   * Simple Linear Regression
   * Multiple Linear Regression
   * K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
   * Logistic Regression
   * Decision Trees
   * Random Forest
* **Unsupervised Learning**
   * K-Means
   * PCA

**Bonus**: if you have the time and you are within the time ranges, you can study these others

* **Gradient Boosting Algorithms**
   * GBM
   * XGBoost
   * LightGBM
   * CatBoost

**Note**: do not spend more than the 3 months stipulated for this stage. Because you will be falling behind and not complying with the study plan. We all have shortcomings at this stage, it is normal, go ahead and then you can resume some concepts that did not understand in detail. The important thing is to have the basic knowledge and move forward!

*If at least you succeed to study the mentioned algorithms of supervised and unsupervised learning, you will have a very clear idea of what you will be able to do in the future*. So don‚Äôt worry about covering everything, remember that it is a process, and ideally you should have some clearly established times so that you don‚Äôt get frustrated and feel you are advancing.

So far, here comes your ‚Äútheoretical‚Äù study of the basics of data science. Now we‚Äôll continue with the practical part!

# Third Quarter: A Real World Project ‚Äî A Full-stack Project

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vrn783vqet661.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=664061b3d33b34979b74b10b9f8a3d0f7b8b99ee

If you want to be more rigorous you can have start and end dates for this period of study at the intermediate level. It could be something like: From July 1 to September 30, 2021 as deadline.

Now that you have a good foundation in programming, statistics, mathematics, data analysis and machine learning algorithms, it is time to move forward and put into practice all this knowledge.

Many of these suggestions may sound out of the box, but believe me they will make a big difference in your career as a data scientist.

## The first thing is to create your web presence:

* *Create a Github (or GitLab) account, and learn Git*. Being able to manage different versions of your code is important, you should have version control over them, not to mention that having an active Github account is very valuable in demonstrating your true skills. On Github, you can also set up your Jupyter Notebooks and make them public, so you can show off your skills as well. This is mine for example: [https://github.com/danielmoralesp](https://github.com/danielmoralesp)
* *Learn the basics of web programming*. The advantage is that you already have Python as a skill, so you can learn Flask to create a simple web page. Or you can use a template engine like Github Pages, Ghost or Wordpress itself and create your online portfolio.
* *Buy a domain with your name*. Something like myname.com, myname.co, myname.dev, etc. This is invaluable so you can have your CV online and update it with your projects. There you can make a big difference, showing your projects, your Jupyter Notebooks and showing that you have the practical skills to execute projects in this area. There are many front-end templates for you to purchase for free or for payment, and give it a more personalized and pleasant look. Don‚Äôt use free sub-domains of Wordpress, Github or Wix, it looks very unprofessional, make your own. Here is mine for example: [https://www.danielmorales.dev/](https://www.danielmorales.dev/)

## Choose a project you are passionate about and create a Machine Learning model around it.

The final goal of this third quarter is to create **ONE** project, that you are passionate about, and that is **UNIQUE** among others. It turns out that there are many typical projects in the community, such as predicting the Titanic Survivors, or predicting the price of Houses in Boston. Those kinds of projects are good for learning, but not for showing off as your **UNIQUE** projects.

If you are passionate about sports, try predicting the soccer results of your local league. If you are passionate about finance, try predicting your country‚Äôs stock market prices. If you are passionate about marketing, try to find someone who has an e-commerce and implement a product recommendation algorithm and upload it to production. If you are passionate about business: make a predictor of the best business ideas for 2021 :)

As you can see, you are limited by your passions and your imagination. ***In fact,*** ***those are the two keys for you to do this project: Passion and Imagination***.

However don‚Äôt expect to make money from it, you are in a learning stage, you need that algorithm to be deployed in production, make an API in Flask with it, and explain in your website how you did it and how people can access it. This is the moment to shine, and at the same time it‚Äôs the moment of the greatest learning.

You will most likely face obstacles, if your algorithm gives 60% of Accuracy after a huge optimization effort, it doesn‚Äôt matter, finish the whole process, deploy it to production, try to get a friend or family member to use it, and that will be the goal achieved for this stage: **Make a Full-stack Machine Learning project.**

By full-stack I mean that you did all the following steps:

* You got the data from somewhere (scrapping, open data or API)
* You did a data analysis
* You cleaned and transformed the data
* You created Machine Learning Models
* You deployed the best model to production for other people to use.

This does not mean that this whole process is what you will always do in your daily job, but it does mean that you will know every part of the pipeline that is needed for a data science project for a company. You will have a unique perspective!

# Fourth Quarter: Seeking Opportunities While Maintaining Practice

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qd0osystet661.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=2da456b15985b2793041256f5e45bca99a23b51a

If you want to be more rigorous you can have start and end dates for this period of study at the final level. It could be something like: From October 1 to December 31, 2021 as deadline.

Now you have theoretical and practical knowledge. You have implemented a model in production. The next step depends on you and your personality. Let‚Äôs say you are an entrepreneur, and you have the vision to create something new from something you discovered or saw an opportunity to do business with this discipline, so it‚Äôs time to start planning how to do it. If that‚Äôs the case, obviously this post won‚Äôt cover that process, but you should know what the steps might be (or start figuring them out).

But if you are one of those who want to get a job as a data scientist, here is my advice.

## Getting a job as a data scientist

>*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to get a job as fast as you think, if you keep thinking the same way‚Äù.Author*

It turns out that all people who start out as data scientists imagine themselves working for the big companies in their country or region. Or even remote. It turns out that if you aspire to work for a large company like data scientist you will be frustrated by the years of experience they ask for (3 or more years) and the skills they request.

Large companies don‚Äôt hire Juniors (or very few do), precisely because they are already large companies. They have the financial muscle to demand experience and skills and can pay a commensurate salary (although this is not always the case). The point is that if you focus there you‚Äôre going to get frustrated!

Here we must return to the following advise: ***‚ÄúYou need creativity to get a job in data science‚Äù***.

Like everything else in life we have to start at different steps, in this case, from the beginning. Here are the scenarios

* *If you are working in a company and in a non-engineering role you must demonstrate your new skills to the company you are working for*. If you are working in the customer service area, you should apply it to your work, and do for example, detailed analysis of your calls, conversion rates, store data and make predictions about it! If you can have data from your colleagues, you could try to predict their sales! This may sound funny, but it‚Äôs about how creatively you can apply data science to your current work and how to show your bosses how valuable it is and **EVANGELIZE** them about the benefits of implementation. You‚Äôll be noticed and they could certainly create a new data related department or job. And you already have the knowledge and experience. The key word here is **Evangelize**. Many companies and entrepreneurs are just beginning to see the power of this discipline, and it is your task to nurture that reality.
* *If you are working in an area related to engineering, but that is not data science*. Here the same applies as the previous example, but you have some advantages, and that is that you could access the company‚Äôs data, and you could use it for the benefit of the company, making analyses and/or predictions about it, and again **EVANGELIZING** your bosses your new skills and the benefits of data science.
* *If you are unemployed (or do not want, or do not feel comfortable following the two examples above)*, you can start looking outside, and what I recommend is that you look for technology companies and / or startups where they are just forming the first teams and are paying some salary, or even have options shares of the company. Obviously here the salaries will not be exorbitant, and the working hours could be longer, but remember that you are in the learning and practice stage (just in the first step), so you can not demand too much, you must land your expectations and fit that reality, and stop pretending to be paid $ 10,000 a month at this stage. But, depending of your country $1.000 USD could be something very interesting to start this new career. Remember, you are a Junior at this stage.

***The conclusion is: don‚Äôt waste your time looking at and/or applying to offers from big companies, because you will get frustrated. Be creative, and look for opportunities in smaller or newly created companies***.

## Learning never stops

While you are in that process of looking for a job or an opportunity, which could take half of your time (50% looking for opportunities, 50% staying in practice), you have to keep learning, you should advance to concepts such as Deep Learning, Data Engineer or other topics that you feel were left loose from the past stages or focus on the topics that you are passionate about within this group of disciplines in data science.

At the same time you can choose a second project, and spend some time running it from end-to-end, and thus increase your portfolio and your experience. If this is the case, try to find a completely different project: if the first one was done with Machine Learning, let this second one be done with Deep learning. If the first one was deployed to a web page, that this second one is deployed to a mobile platform. Remember, creativity is the key!

# Conclusion

We are at an ideal time to plan for 2021, and if this is the path you want to take, start looking for the platforms and media you want to study on. Get to work and don‚Äôt miss this opportunity to become a data scientist in 2021!

d85isn,I open sourced my book,"Hey guys,

I decided to write a small introductory(elementary) book to deep learning. I decided that it will be a cool idea if I open source it on github so that more people can be benefited from it. Since I am no expert, I also considered open sourcing because it will allow other experts to contribute to make this book richer.

In this book I wrote my intuitive understanding about things which can help beginners out.

cs1yz3,I used r/AskMen and r/AskWomen to build a classifier to predict an author's gender from their text.,"[https://github.com/polywock/text2gender](https://github.com/polywock/text2gender)

EDIT2: Yikes, I made a pretty dumb mistake. Wrap it up folks. This model is very stupid. The testing data was USED to calculate a masculinity map that is essential to getting the features. This is probably overfitted garbage. A lesson to you all on behalf, never use the testing data for anything. Sorry folks. I'll try salvage it, and update you guys on the actual accuracy.

EDIT3: Okay, crisis averted. The problem wasn't that big. I had to create 3 separate datasets. Training, testing, and prelim. The prelim dataset is solely used to generate a masculinity map, which is used to get a total masculinity score, a feature of the model. Results are mostly similar. Tbh, it probably didn't even matter that much.

I still wouldn't trust this model for real world data because all training, testing, and prelim data is from AskWomen and AskMen. Next step is testing on data outside of this bubble.

EDIT4: Okay, it seems to hold up on non-AskMen/AskWomen subreddits.

EDIT5: Just to clarify why I thought the model was faulty. I found men/women through AskMen/AskWomen. And used the Pushshift API (god bless them) to query their posts from other subreddits like AskReddit. The API has a ""author=user1,user2,user3,etc"" parameter you can use to get only comments from specific users. I tested the accuracy and it was 50%. For binary classification, that means it was worthless. I freaked out and tried to find the problem. I found a minor problem and just assumed that it was a much bigger problem that it actually was. But, I later realized I was using the API wrong. I was using ""authors="", instead of ""author="". So, I was not filtering by specific users. Essentially getting back random posts, hence the 50% accuracy.",304,58,polywock,2019-08-18 14:38:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/cs1yz3/i_used_raskmen_and_raskwomen_to_build_a/,0,learnmachinelearning

1brerfc,"How to become an ""Expert"" in ML ??","I am planning of giving atleast the next half a decade to ML/AI, I  want to gain expert or researcher level knowledge in this feild if not in the next 5 years then in the next 10 years I want to play this for the long haul right now I have clear basics of python I have done DSA and native android devlopment.

I'll get straight to the questions

1. What would a hand's on approach look like in learning ML basically how to learn ML by building stuff. 
2. Where should one start (what topics one should start with supervised, unsupervised,classification, learn about libraries or something else) ??.
3. What are the basics of linear algebra, calculas, probability, statistic and optimiztion that I should start with and what are the topics that I should go after completing the basics. I really want to overkill in maths
4. I want to be job ready by the next year's march so what are the things that I should focus on in the short term so that it make's it easier to get a job while also helping in the long term goal

If I have to sum it all up in the short term I want build a good base and builds some good projects so I could get hired. In the long term I want become an researcher.

Almost 3 months back I promised myself that I will take up this challenge to warm up my ML skills before starting my Masters in Computer Science (OMSCS) at Georgia Institute of Technology. And I am glad to share that today I have completed my [**#100daysofcode**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=%23100daysofcode) challenge.

**Task Taken:** Create a [**GIT repository**](https://github.com/rj425/ML-Coursera/) containing all the programming exercises written from scratch in Python for the Coursera course called ""Machine Learning"" by Adjunct Professor Andrew Ng at Stanford University.

* Written in Python3 using Jupyter Notebook.
* Explains the mathematical derivations in detail.
* Discusses a few feature engineering techniques.
* Mainly uses Pandas and Numpy library.
* Zero use of Sklearn and like libraries.

You can find the entire list of kernels [here.](https://github.com/rj425/ML-Coursera/blob/master/README.md) My personal favourite is [this one](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rj425/ML-Coursera/blob/master/Exercise-6/ex6.ipynb).

I personally feel the combination of the actual course and this repository would make a great guide for ML beginners who prefer Python over R. It is a collection of all the other supporting research papers and lectures I have used to get an in-depth understanding of various ML techniques...

While taking the course I wrote all the algorithms taught in the course from ***SCRATCH USING NUMPY***. I also added explanations and intuitions which I learned from various sources, to the notebooks.

I have compiled all the jupyter notebooks in a repo and I am sharing it with u people, as it might be helpful to those who wish to learn ML from the fundamentals. Especially for people who are taking the Machine Learning by Stanford course, and are looking for algorithms and neural nets implementted in python from scratch. I have also linked Gerges's repo in Readme, which enables you to submit the Programming Assignments in Python.

During my freshman year, I became enthralled by the thought that systems could have ""intelligence"" of their own. I self-studied calculus, linear algebra, and a hint of probability. Andrew Ng was the one who taught me all the fundamentals. Yannic Kilcher helped me read my first papers.

After learning the basics, I emailed literally every ML professor in Chicago and prayed for a position. I landed on a fantastic lab and was mentored through the scientific aspect of the field. This year I then started my own project combining Neural O/SDEs to generate videos. It was published at the NeurIPS preregistration workshop.

oa3mln,Four books I swear by for AI/ML,"I‚Äôve seen a lot of bad ‚ÄúHow to get started with ML‚Äù posts throughout the internet. I‚Äôm not going to claim that I can do any better, but I‚Äôll try. 

Before I start, I‚Äôm going to say that I‚Äôm highly opinionated: I strongly believe that an ML practitioner should know theoretical fundamentals through and through. I‚Äôm a research assistant, so these recommendations are biased to my experiences. As such, this post does not apply to those who want to use off the shelf ML algorithms, trained or otherwise, for SWE tasks. These books are overkill if all you need is sklearn for some business task and you aren‚Äôt interested in peeling back a level of abstraction. I‚Äôm also going to assume that you know your Calc, Linear Algebra and Statistics down cold.

I‚Äôm going to start by saying that I don‚Äôt care about your tech stack: I‚Äôve been wrong to think that Python or R is the best way to go. The most talented ML engineer I know(who was my professor) does not know Python. 

Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS: I know what you‚Äôre thinking: this looks like a bait and switch. However, knowing how to solve deterministic computational problems well goes a long way. CLRS do a fantastic job at rigorously teaching you how to think algorithmically. As the book ends, the reader learns to appreciate the nature of P and NP problems, and learns a sense of the limits of computability. 

Artificial Intelligence, a Modern Approach: This books is still one of my all time favorites because it feels like a survey of AI. Newer editions have an expanded focus on Deep Learning, but I love this book because it highlights how classic AI techniques(like backtracking for CSPs) help deal with NP hard problems. In many ways, it feels like a natural progression of CLRS, because it deals with a whole new slew of problems from scheduling to searching against an adversary.

Pattern Classification: This is the best Machine Learning book I‚Äôve ever read. I prefer this book over ESL because of the narrative it presents. The book starts with an ideal scenario in which a distribution and its parameters are known to make predictions, and then slowly removes parts of the ideal scenario until the reader is left with a very real world set of limitations upon which inference must be made. Interestingly enough, I don‚Äôt think the words ‚ÄúMachine Learning‚Äù ever come up in the book(though I might be wrong).

Deep Learning: Ian Goodfellow et al really made a gold standard textbook in my opinion. It is technically rigorous yet intuitive. I have nothing to add that hasn‚Äôt already been said.

ArXiv: I know that I said four books but beyond these texts, my best resource is ArXiv for bleeding edge Deep Learning. Keep in mind that ArXiv isn‚Äôt rigorously reviewed so exercise ample caution.

I hope these 4 + 1 resources help you in your journey.",276,42,VimmyBoi,2021-06-29 07:48:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/oa3mln/four_books_i_swear_by_for_aiml/,0,learnmachinelearning

As I want to actually understand what is happening underneath the hood, I am first learning the necessary math (per Khan Academy at the moment). Before that I learned Python for a few months. 

I was told that in order to get good at both (and not forget anything), I should do both things in tandem (programming and learning the math, the first half of the day one thing and the other half the other thing). What are the best projects I could write in this scenario ? I was thinking of doing some projects only involving Pandas and Numpy, as I don't know ML yet as said. Another idea was maybe making some game with Pygame.

It‚Äôs Lewis here, one of the co-developers of the free [Hugging Face course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1) on NLP, Transformers, and beyond. I‚Äôm excited to share that the course is now open source!

This means that it is now possible to translate the course into other languages, which has been one of the most requested features from the community. You can check out the GitHub repo if you‚Äôd like to help out: [https://github.com/huggingface/course#-languages-and-translations](https://github.com/huggingface/course#-languages-and-translations)

This release also comes with a fancy new frontend and here‚Äôs a sneak peek at the third part of the course that we plan to release soon:

* **Building and sharing demos:** shows you how to use Gradio and Spaces to build interactive ML demos.
* **Transformers can hear:** explores the application of Transformers beyond NLP, starting with speech processing tasks like audio classification and models like Wav2Vec2 and HuBERT.
* **Transformers can see:** takes a look (pun intended!) at the application of Transformers to computer vision, using models like ViT and DEIT.
* **Optimizing for production:** introduces a whole bag of tricks like quantization and pruning to compress your models to run faster in production environments.",271,19,lewtun,2022-03-29 14:17:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/tr0s6a/the_hugging_face_course_goes_opensource/,0,learnmachinelearning
syj7vx,Almost no one knows how easily you can optimize your AI models,"The situation is fairly simple.¬†**Your model could run 10 times faster**¬†by adding a few lines to your code, but you weren't aware of it. Let me expand on that.

1. AI applications are multiplying like mushrooms, which is awesome
2. As a result, more and more people are turning to the dark side, joining the AI world, as I did
3. The problem? Developers focus only on AI, cleaning up datasets and training their models. Almost no one has a background in hardware, compilers, computing, cloud, etc
4. The result? Developers spend a lot of hours improving the accuracy and performance of their software, and all their hard work risks being undone by the wrong choice of hardware-software coupling

This problem bothered me for a long time, so with a couple of buddies at [Nebuly](https://nebuly.ai/) (all ex MIT, ETH and EPFL), we put a lot of energy into an¬†**open-source library**¬†called¬†**nebullvm**¬†to make DL compiler technology accessible to any developer, even for those who know nothing about hardware, as I did.

How does it work? It¬†**speeds up your DL models by \~5-20x**¬†by testing the best DL compilers out there and selecting the optimal one to best couple your AI model with your machine (GPU, CPU, etc.). All this in just a few lines of code.

The library is open source and you can find it here¬†[https://github.com/nebuly-ai/nebullvm](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/nebullvm).

Please leave a star on GitHub for the hard work in building the library :) It's a simple act for you, a big smile for us.

**If you are interested in a Career in Data Science and Machine Learning. Take time to read case studies from various industries, reading and implementing research papers.** 

Data science and ML is less about deployment of models and usage of various libraries/ tools but more about its application to solving problems.

¬∑ Reading use case studies from different sources and companies to understand how data science projects operate, function and are utilized. This allows you to see a more practical approach on its applications. Do read use case stories from companies like Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, Uber, Facebook, Airbnb and others that have great use case studies. Check out how Facebook leverages Deep Learning to increase ad revenue and how Amazon developed its anticipatory shipping models, etc.

¬∑ Research on the industries and companies that you are interested in / worked for to get a familiar taste with their challenges and potential data science/ analytics use cases.

¬∑ Next in, seek out existing data, projects and research papers/ resources related to your field and problems, read, understand and attempt to reproduce and implement your results.

¬∑ The Research papers provide an excellent way to learn about how different machine learning models were created, the kinds of problems they can solve and providing you with a better intuition about how they work. More recent publications and industry case studies provide you with insights into how different Data Science technologies are being used to solve real world business problems üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇ

gkr44a,Free zoom lecture about advances in deep learning and 3D modeling for reddit community,"Hi all,

I work with machine learning and 3D modeling (you can checkout my profile info). I have a cool lecture about the advances in Academia in automatic 3D modeling, the lecture is called ""From 2D to 3D with AI"". I usually teach it at conferences and machine learning courses. Now because of Corona, there is less teaching, so I thought of offering it to the community here :) If there will be 20+ redditors who are interested in the lecture we will make it happen. Feel free to DM me, or leave your info here and we will take it from there.

&#x200B;

Hey all, since I see there is a lot of interest already, please fill-out the form so that I would know how to prepare the lecture and at what time: [https://forms.gle/wSXexXSBj5e5267G8](https://forms.gle/wSXexXSBj5e5267G8)

&#x200B;

\[Edited 2\]

Well, this is kind of amazing, I was expecting for 20-50 people maximum, there are currently 232 people registered from literally all over the world. I will probably need to start a group somewhere to manage this. There might be several lectures for different technical backgrounds and time zones. I am still thinking of the best approach. Will send updates via email once the plan is set.

In the meantime, still accepting registration, so fill free to fill the form with your details to stay in the loop.

&#x200B;

\[Edited 3\]

So, following this amazing and unexpected turn, 329 people registered (!!!) from all over the world. This is too many people for one zoom event :P

I have opened a sub-reddit manage all event details and share all the information. In this sub everyone can also discuss about anything regarding image processing, 3D modelling and AI:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/2D3DAI/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2D3DAI/)

Currently there are two events scheduled, one for the eastern hemisphere and one for the western - they are stickied so you can easily find them. I will do the same lecture twice so that people from different timezones could participate, since we truly have people from all over the world :) This lecture will not require technical background in the field.

For the more technically advanced people (almost half the registered have DL background) - we will probably have another set of 2 lectures. I just want to start this first round, see how it goes and take it from there.

Seeing this amazing interest from people, I have started putting into plan more free lectures in deep learning on other subjects from other guest lecturers. We will take it a step at a time. All info will be shared in /r/2D3DAI and probably also in this subreddit.

Regarding recording the event and putting it on youtube - It will definitely be recorded, if I see that the quality is good, I will also publish it online. Will update in the new subreddit (and via email to those who registered).

So I've been working on this project for a very long time now, and I'm finally ready to publish it!

This project started out as a final project for my Data Science course and further evolved while taking the Sequence Models course in the Deep Learning specialization on Coursera.

This notebook is written in an educational style, explaining every step in a beginner friendly manner. I really hope that you'll enjoy going through this notebook and gain not only technical skills but also analytical skills from it. We will discover how to process text in order to infer sentiment from it and try to take advantage of every result, visualization and failure in order to further understand the data and the models.

Throughout this notebook, we will discover the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by building a sentiment analysis model. The goal of such a model would be to classify tweets as either having positive or negative sentiment. We will first build a Na√Øve Bayes model, a classical statistical approach for sentiment classification, and then compare it to a Deep Learning model - LSTM.

bsfp45,Why is ML software so horrible?,"Why the fuck does it take literally DAYS to configure a proper ML environment?

I just spent 5 hours trying to install tensorflow with GPU support without success. 

I've tried just pip installing tensorflow-gpu. But that doesn't work because it blindly assumes I have exactly cuda 10.0 installed, but on my system it's already cuda 10.1. WHY ISN'T THAT COMPATIBLE??!?

But ok, sometimes things are a certain way and you just have to deal with it. So manually installing cuda 10.0 should fix it. So I download the cuda 10.0 package and try to pacman -U cuda-10.0.130-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz and BOOM, ERROR! Installing cuda 10.0 apparently needs gcc7, but I have gcc8 installed. Again: WHY ISN'T THAT COMPATIBLE??!?

Before I completely destroy my dev machine, I'll try another way to gpu support. On the [Tensorflow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source) it says the easiest way to get tf with gpu support is using the docker image. So I install docker... but no no no, not that easy. First I also have to install nvidia-docker, which i understand is a way to give docker apps gpu access. But no no no, there is ofc no package for my system, so I need to fetch it from the AUR. So I install pamac to install nvidia-docker, install nvidia-docker and THEN IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK. ""Unknown runtime specified nvidia.""

Well... then I'll just have to build TF from source manually. To avoid easy mistakes, I use this [very recent guide](https://mc.ai/build-tensorflow-2-0-from-source-with-gpu-and-tensorrt-supports-on-ubuntu-18-04/) on how to do that. It's for Ubuntu, but most things should be similar. Noo, that also requires an old gcc version. But ok, gotta try it anyways. Aaaaaand next problem. EVEN THOUGH I PROPERLY TOLD IT WHICH CUDA VERSION I HAVE INSTALLED AND WHERE IT IS, THE BUILD SCRIPT CANT FUCKING FIND IT: ""no such package '@local_config_cuda//cuda'""

    Cuda Configuration Error: None of the libraries match their SONAME: /opt/cuda/lib64/libcublas.so.10.1, /opt/cuda/lib/libcublas.so.10.1

THESE FILES ARE LITERALLY AT THESE EXACT LOCATIONS! What is the issue?

Why can't I AT LEAST get a proper error message that you can understand without being actively involved in TFs development? I just want to train some neural nets, not get a degree in cuda programming.



I've tried a few other guides but none of them work. Countless other people report the same problems.

Why is it so extremely hard and time-consuming just to set up a development environment? Machine learning is complicated enough by itself. I bet a lot of new people just give up after the first few hours of tinkering, this is so unfortunate. 

I have absolutely no problem with doing so research, editing some config files, manually building some tools, but there is a point where ANY motivation I had is just lost, because no matter what I try, there is always some component that is broken.

This book has been an excellent choice and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to start with ML. It explains well the most common ML models one by one, and allows you to understand how they work first instead of just showing you how to code them in sci-kit learn without any explanation.

Speaking from personal experience, if you feel confused definitely check this book out, it will initially explain everything very simply but also goes in a lot of details when you read further on. And it also teaches you how to apply the things you read about in practice!

iveu4z,Learn machine learning in Python by editing a spreadsheet,"Heyo, I'm Nate!

In quarantine, I've been trying to learn machine learning in Python. Since I'm a beginner, I spend most of my time furiously browsing Stack Overflow to find the right Python functions :)

At school, I learned to do data analysis in a spreadsheet. Because spreadsheets are so visual, they make data cleaning and manipulation parts of machine learning much easier. I wanted to find a way to have this ease in my Python projects.

So I built [Mito](https://trymito.io/?source=reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning)!

Mito is an editable spreadsheet in your Jupyter notebook. Pass in a Pandas data frame, make the edits you want, and Mito will automatically convert your edits into Python code.

You can clean, filter, find/replace, and use standard spreadsheet functions in Mito, giving you the visibility and ease of a spreadsheet with the power of Python.

I built Mito as an extension to Jupyter Lab, which I'm sure many of y'all use for ML projects generally. At a high level, you can think of this as inserting a spreadsheet into your notebook, and then some backend Python is responsible for creating an a ""Python translation"" of the edits you make to the spreadsheet.

I'd love to hear your thoughts about how this might be useful to your learning. I'll be in the comments with my co-creators u/aarondiamond-reivich and u/Jake_Stack808.

g1ebem,Pure NumPy implementation of convolutional neural network (CNN),"tl;dr up front -

I wrote a pure NumPy implementation of the prototypical convolutional neural network classes (ConvLayer, PoolLayers, FlatLayer, and FCLayer, with subclasses for softmax and such), and some sample code to classify the MNIST database using any of several architectures.

Along the way, I found that the typical ConvLayer example was absurdly inefficient, so I provided an equivalent solution that uses NumPy more efficiently and achieves a 1,000-fold performance improvement.

Here's [the GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/neuron-whisperer/cnn-numpy), including a readme and a FAQ about the project and the new ""Stride Groups"" technique.

---

During my machine learning studies, I spent some time completing Dr. Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Coursera sequence, which is generally excellent. The main example, ""Building a Convolutional Network Step By Step,"" provides a NumPy-based implementation of a convolutional layer and max / average pooling layers and is a great learning exercise. However, looking back on the code, I was disappointed to find that it has some problems.

* The code is provided in a Jupyter notebook with a lot of intermediate exposition and unit tests. While it is a great learning exercise, it makes for a poor reference for the code of an actual CNN implementation.

* The code isn't very readable. Global functions, variables passed around in a clumsy dictionary called ""cache"" with string names for variables, cached variables that are never used again... it's quite messy.

* The example isn't complete. The ConvLayer function calculates dW/db, but doesn't update the weights. It doesn't have a flattening layer, or any fully-connected layers, or any loss function or training algorithm - all of those are provided in different exercises.

* Worst of all, it doesn't have any kind of application to a real problem. The next exercise in the course involves applying machine learning to classify the [MNIST handwritten digits data set](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)... but it doesn't use the NumPy code at all. Instead, it makes a hard transition into TensorFlow. ""Now that you know how CNNs work, forget all of that under-the-hood stuff and just use this platform!"" (Worse, the TensorFlow code is all 1.x, so it won't even run in today's TF 2.x environments without a bunch of backwards-compatibility edits.)

Given all of that - I set aside some time to take the example code, clean it up, and add the bits that are missing. The results are nice: every basic layer type as a Python class and a Network class to train them.

[https://www.github.com/neuron-whisperer/cnn-numpy/cnn_numpy.py](https://www.github.com/neuron-whisperer/cnn-numpy/blob/master/cnn_numpy.py)

Then I wrote some code to use it to classify the MNIST handwritten digits data set:

[https://www.github.com/neuron-whisperer/cnn-numpy/mnist.py](https://www.github.com/neuron-whisperer/cnn-numpy/blob/master/mnist.py)

The problem was that the CNN class is so slow that it's unusable!

Both the ConvLayer and PoolLayer classes feature a four-layer-deep iteration for both forward propagation and backpropagation:

    for i in range(number_of_samples):
        for h in range(output_height):
            for w in range(output_width):
                for f in range(number_of_filters):
                    # do some stuff

Let's say you want to apply a simple CNN to the MNIST database, which has 70,000 images. You choose a 95%/5% train/test split, so the training set has 65,500 inputs. Each image is 28x28x1. Let's say you want to apply one convolutional layer with 32 filters of size 3x3, stride 1, padding 0. (A 3x3 filter of stride 1 is shifted 26x26 steps over each image.)

Based on those hyperparameters, this iteration requires 65,500 * 26 * 26 * 32 = 14,168,960,000 iterations of this loop. That's 14 *trillion* iterations for forward propagation over one training epoch. Backpropagation requires another 14 trillion iterations. Altogether, it requires about 36 hours *for one epoch* on a decently powered workstation (no GPU, because NumPy).

Now, NumPy is really fast - if you use it right. But no matter how optimized it may be, 28 trillion calculations is going to take forever.

So I redesigned it to minimize iteration, and instead came up with a new computational technique that focuses on array slices to align the parts of the input tensor with the corresponding parts of the filter tensor.

The new implementation is 100% equivalent to the prototypical example - you can drop it right into place. And it runs *1,000 times faster*. You can actually train this updated CNN on the MNIST database to under 5% error in about five minutes. It's certainly nowhere near as efficient as TensorFlow or PyTorch, but it works reasonably well for simple problems like the MNIST data set.

We used Bishop's *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* which has some interesting notation that didn't help with how counter-intuitive the math of the neural network felt to me as a beginner. This Kaggle notebook explains in a clearer manner using some updated notation to help explain the math of the feedforward neural network.

nj1jfn,A tool for planning efficient paths through ML topics and learning them,"***First version is live here:*** [https://app.learney.me/](https://app.learney.me/)

Learning ML online is slow, frustrating and often dull.

On courses, you waste time re-covering content you already know or covering content irrelevant to your goal.

We've built a platform to change that by planning the most efficient route through the knowledge graph of ML, and taking into account what you already know.

[In green: your knowledge. In orange: your goal. In blue: the most efficient path](https://preview.redd.it/z8gu5wgcat071.png?width=1385&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfed835bc44204bd8d46e6daea69fe793e28bc90)

It is currently a knowledge graph of the dependencies you need for each concept in ML with the best content we could find for each.

But we're planning to grow this out into: 1) a community platform for curating that content, and 2) asks your regular questions the update the representation of your knowledge base and tailor the best content to you.

***To find out more***, read our previous post and article describing the idea: [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/n397hw/were\_building\_a\_platform\_to\_efficiently\_learn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/n397hw/were_building_a_platform_to_efficiently_learn/)

I've looked at some of the more popular ones out there and here‚Äôs my top 4 so far. Let me know what you guys think about these:

* [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) \- An ML platform by Google Cloud. They have AI-powered tools to ingest, analyze, and store video data. Good for image classification, NLP, recommendation systems etc.
* [Jina AI](https://jina.ai/) \-They offer a neural search solution that can help build smarter, more efficient search engines. They also have a list of [cool github repos](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina) that you can check out. Similar to Vertex AI, they have image classification tools, NLPs, fine tuners etc.
* [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) \- an open-source platform for managing your ML lifecycle. What‚Äôs great is that they also support popular Python libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and R.
* Neptune.ai, which promises to streamline your workflows and make collaboration a breeze.

lw2fkl,A comment on all the little guides posted here.,"I think we have enough of them.

There are so many of the same shallow posts trying to explain all of machine learning in one stupid infographic and somehow they always end up getting a ton of likes.I don‚Äôt see how they are actually helpful to anyone though.If you actually want to help the community and want to make (or more likely steal) a little info graphic, post something that focuses on depth of a single topic rather than trying to overreach.   It would be much more helpful to the community.A single post explaining just Dropout OR just L2, would be much more helpful and insightful than a post that tries to explain every single concept related to overfitting.

Unfortunately this will likely not change though if we as a community continue to upvote these crappy little ‚Äúguides‚Äù that teach you all of machine learning...

What is the point of doing this? I know the final weights will differ depending on the random state chosen, but there's a lot of people where it's really inconvenient to run a complex neural network on a million samples and they just want to try out the estimator in other contexts to see if it works well or not.

With mygrad in hand, my students need only learn NumPy's syntax and rules for array mathematics, but still have the power of auto-diff available to them. It also provides essential operations (e.g. N-dimensional convolutions, pooling, batch-norm, a numba-compiled GRU, etc.) for creating neural networks. This library is simple but quite powerful, if I do say so myself!

[noggin](https://noggin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a library for live-logging and live-plotting measurements during experiments, all in a Jupyter notebook. Think of this as extremely simple version of TensorBoard. This is a great tool for my students to monitor their models' progress in real time. The logging is quite nice too and exports measurements as xarrays (I also use this tool in my actual research!)

[Python Like You Mean It](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/) is a totally-free (no ads!) resource for learning the basics of Python and NumPy, with a bent towards STEM applications. This has proven to be an effective resource for students to develop the sort of Python experience that they need in order to be effective in ML.

I hope that you all find these resources useful. Please also pass these along to educators who may be well-served by them! :)",229,8,meowklaski,2020-02-17 15:13:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/f5a33r/pythonbased_educational_tools_for_machine_learning/,0,learnmachinelearning
nrdajq,A practical guide to MLOps using AWS Sagemaker.,"I recently completed my first end to end model development to deployment project using AWS.
And I was wondering if anyone would be interested in a guide if I wrote one.

The guide will contain below topics.
1. How to create CI/CD pipeline in AWS Sagemaker.
2. How to save transformations on AWS S3.
3. How to build lambda functions to invoke model deployed.
4. How to build REST API to access the model results from front-end.

Let me know what you guys think and if you have any suggestions.

Edit: Thanks for the response everyone, I really appreciate all your inputs. I will get down to work and share the first draft of guide as soon as possible.
Looking forward to getting reviews from you guys.

gke0xq,[Course Giveaway] - Creating a Machine Learning Pipeline,"Hey everyone my new course ""Creating a Machine Learning Pipeline"" was just approved on Udemy. I wanted to celebrate by giving it away to folks who are learning. The course focuses on using React on the Front-end and Firebase on the Back-end.

While we do create a machine learning model that can classify animals that is not the focus of the course. (We actually use Googles AutoML to do the heavy lifting, but you can use your own models, they need to be a tflite version) The focus is creating a pipeline that can process data, get predictions on that data and then displaying the information to a dashboard.

Seriously, this 3-months-to-first-job thing needs to stop. You can get a very nice intro to ML in 3 months, and work on a few easy projects (that likely have been done by someone else already). But being introduced to ML isn't nearly the same as being an employable expert. 

I don't mean to discourage anyone by this rant. On the contrary, I think everyone curious about ML should learn some. Just don't fall prey to some snake oil salesman. Manage your expectations, and keep studying and practicing every moment of your spare time.

P.S. I am sure there are people who have actually managed to get a job in ML after only 3 months of studying.

ocykhn,How do you guys maintain motivation on learning ML?,"As the title suggests, how do you guys keep pushing yourselves on learning ML? I actually self-taught myself web development, made a freelance gig and was successful. So I tried on self-learning ML and said to myself I was successful in self-learning web development, so why not ML.

I am currently enrolled on **Free** Udemy ML courses or skimming through books and I feel overwhelmed by the different math concepts and literatures. Fortunately, I did an engineering degree and was exposed to the math concepts like linear programming, vectors, matrix, and etc. so I'm actually not starting from scratch.

I was actually excited when I planned on learning ML but these days I'm finding it hard to push myself on watching and logging in on the internet to learn. I feel like I'm in a bit of a stump and I am afraid that I might just quit on trying haha. I feel like the reason is in terms of gratification, like I'm not seeing results of my learning immediately compared to when I was learning web dev. Like those little joys when I make something work on a web page and stuff like that haha. I just don't get it through the ML courses I am doing. Don't get me wrong I genuinely want to learn ML, I just don't know how to push myself and get motivated again.

Anyway going back to the main question, did you guys experience any of this? If yes, how would you suggest on getting through it? I'm thinking on enrolling on a paid course or just get into a University instead so I am actually forced to learn haha.

By the way, the courses or videos I went through were mainly focused on discussing the Mathematical foundations of ML. Basically, it goes through all the basic operations that you'll do in ML.

**Edit.** My end goal in this so far is to be able to be knowledgeable enough to implement models and etc. Just to get my foot in it, then maybe explore on research or application of existing researches. If it goes well, then maybe a back-up career if I grow out of my current job (Data Analyst).

**Edit 2.** Sorry, fell asleep and woke up to this!! Wow, I appreciate all your responses. It's reassuring to know that this community is helpful for noobs like me haha. Thanks guys!! Based from what I saw on the comments, I think its just probably my approach on learning ML. I focused too much on the concepts and fundamentals and it got too dry on me fast haha. I'll try on the suggested sites, approaches, and books to maybe go around this stump. I'll still look around on the fundamentals but maybe not too much. Really thankful for all your responses. I'm planning to post up on my learning path in the future if I succeed in this, to someday help starters like me.

jzi1p3,Hidden Features in JupyterLab,"If you work as a Data Scientist, you probably also spend the majority of your workday analyzing data in JupyterLab. So it is a good time investment to learn a few built-in JupyterLab features that will simplify your workflow.

# 1. Workspaces

JupyterLab‚Äôs Workspaces comes in handy when working on multiple projects at the same time. Workspaces come builtin with JupyterLab so no third-party extensions are needed.

With Workspaces, you can separate your projects into Workspaces. Then you switch between a Workspace for project A and a Workspace for project B.

Before using Workspaces, I had to close all Notebooks from one project and open the Notebooks for the project I intended to work on. I prefer a clean work environment.

Using Workspaces is really simple. Unknowingly you were already using Workspaces. You start with a default Workspace: [http://localhost:8888/lab](http://localhost:8888/lab).

To create a new Workspace (or access the existing one) simply add to the URL: /[workspaces/blog](http://localhost:8888/lab/workspaces/blog). With this, you would access (or create) a blog Workspace. A full URL is [http://localhost:8888/lab/workspaces/blog](http://localhost:8888/lab/workspaces/blog).

[Organize your projects in Workspaces.](https://i.redd.it/qdxjgn9gwz061.gif)

Workspaces have many powerful features, which are beyond the scope of this article. See [JupyterLab URLs](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/urls.html#url-workspaces-ui) to learn more about Workspaces.

# 2. Window Management

Did you know that JupyterLab has a built-in window manager (no third party extension needed)?

You can organize Jupyter Notebooks side by side (or even three Notebooks vertically or horizontally). You can also move Jupyter Notebooks (or any window) to so that it takes less visual space‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis is useful for the Console.

[Window management in JupyterLab.](https://i.redd.it/43oyifu4wz061.gif)

To code without distractions try Full-Screen editing with JupyterLab. It works great on macOS. When using it, it is hard to distinguish JupyterLab from a full-fledged IDE.

[Full-Screen editing using Chrome on macOS.](https://i.redd.it/n2wn6aeawz061.gif)

While Full-Screen editing in JupyterLab looks great, I rarely use it as it hides browser tabs, which makes browsing the web difficult. Multiple screen setup might help to overcome this issue.

# 3. Use CLI in Jupyter¬†Notebook

Did you know you can access Command Line Interface (CLI) directly from a Jupyter Notebook? You can run CLI commands with¬†! prefix.

Let‚Äôs say you have a missing Python package. You can simply install it from Jupyter Notebook by running in the cell:

    !pip install numpy

dipq7k,Why not a course created by the community for the community?,"I have been following r/learnmachinelearning and r/machinelearning for a while now and I love them both. After reading about the ""Siraj Rival"" incident, I had a few thoughts.

I believe if we can organize ourselves, we can as a community create our own course. I don't mean video lectures and stuff but organizing the content available on the internet to help people at any level of expertise learn something new.

The mods or anyone else can bring together a few people from this community (after verification) and make sure the community is diverse. There are a ton of packages out there that can get a lot of stuff done and given a package, there must be someone who is familiar with it. This group then collect info on what the community needs/wants to learn.

Then, learning paths are created for several applications of machine learning. These should describe the best set of content (blog posts/videos/tutorials, etc) and suggest an order to complete them.

The next step would be to share this content and have a chatroom, preferably in discord. In discord, members have levels that can be improved by completing parts of learning paths or completing projects. These projects will be judged by the community through votes. Members who have a higher level will have more value on their votes and can have the right to suggest changes to the learning paths.

All this must be done free of cost.

I'll read them all and respond after Friday.",212,32,BBloggsbott,2019-10-16 14:01:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/dipq7k/why_not_a_course_created_by_the_community_for_the/,0,learnmachinelearning

cg2nm3,Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow - recommendation,"Hi,

A few months ago I decided to start with ML (complete beginner), I searched online for free tutorials, but I couldn't really find anything good. I kept on feeling very confused and I barely understood linear regression. After a while I decided to buy the book called: 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow'. 

This was literally the best thing I ever bought. I finished reading it yesterday and I feel like I understand a lot about ML (especially neural networks).

I love how this explains the most common ML models one by one, and allows you to actually understand how they work (without confusing too much), instead of just showing how to code them in sci-kit learn without any explanation.

The author also has a github page with all the code used in the book, so there is no need to rewrite it.

If you are a beginner or you are feeling confused definitely check this book out, it will explain everything very simply but still in a lot of details. It also teaches you how to apply the things you read about in practice!

*If you have any questions about the book feel free to ask me!*

125xgvs,We are opening a Reading Club for ML papers. Who wants to join? üéì,"Hey!

My friend, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Oxford and an MSc graduate from Cambridge, and I (a Backend Engineer), started a reading club where we go through 20 research papers that cover 80% of what matters today

Our goal is to read one paper a week, then meet to discuss it and share knowledge, and insights and keep each other accountable, etc.

I shared it with a few friends and was surprised by the high interest to join.

So I decided to invite you guys to join us as well.

We are looking for ML enthusiasts that want to join our reading clubs (there are already 3 groups).

&#x200B;

The concept is simple - we have a discord that hosts all of the ‚Äúreaders‚Äù and I split all readers (by their background) into small groups of 6, some of them are more active (doing additional exercises, etc it depends on you.), and some are less demanding and mostly focus on reading the papers.

As for prerequisites, I think its recommended to have at least BSC in CS or equivalent knowledge and the ability to read scientific papers in English

&#x200B;

If any of you are interested to join please comment below

And if you have any suggestions feel free to let me know

**Question**:  I have no idea how one might go about setting up and deploying a dashbord. How do you do it?

Say my company wants an internally viewable dashboard which tracks what data we have from what customers. This should be accessible from some sort of website (i.e. dashboard.mycompany.com).

I can get those numbers really easily, and save them in some accessible place on AWS easily too.

This is mostly due to being a compiled language as well as decades of optimizations on the compiler side being implemented.

11szhsh,Introducing OpenChatKit - The Open-Source Alternative to ChatGPT,"Hey everyone! I'm excited to share my latest article about a new open-source technology called OpenChatKit.

For those who work in NLP, you're probably familiar with ChatGPT - a powerful language model that can perform various natural language processing tasks. However, ChatGPT is not open-source, which limits its accessibility and customizability.

OpenChatKit, on the other hand, is an open-source alternative to ChatGPT that provides users with similar NLP capabilities while allowing for more customization and control. With OpenChatKit, users can train their own models and fine-tune them to their specific use cases.

In my article, I dive into the features of OpenChatKit, the Instruction-tuned Large Language Model, and the Limitations of the Model.

If you're interested in learning more about OpenChatKit and how it can enhance your NLP workflows, check out my article [OpenChatKit: Open-Source ChatGPT Alternative ](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2023/03/openchatkit-opensource-chatgpt-alternative.html).

üîµ Overfitting üîµ

üßê Overfitting is a common phenomenon the machine learning community tries to avoid like the plague. This is because when a model overfits it performs extremely well on the training data that it is provided but performs poorly and fails to generalize on unseen data.

üíæ You can imagine overfitting with an analogy. When one assumes that the questions in the exercise session of a lecture are exactly what will be asked in the exam and end up memorizing them. During the exam, they realize that this rote-learning would not be of any help in answering unseen questions.

üòÆ Overfitting can be avoided in many ways. 5 common ways to do so is by (1) regularization of the model parameters using L1 or L2 norm for example (see previous posts for more details), (2) gathering more training data to let the model cut through the noise, (3) early stopping by monitoring the training and validation error curves, (4) reducing the number of features by selecting better features and (5) by performing data augmentation.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first post and hopefully the first of many to come. I have been studying and practicing Machine Learning and Computer Vision for 7+ years. As time has passed I have realized more and more the power of data-driven decision-making. Seeing firsthand what ML is capable of I have personally felt that it can be a great inter-disciplinary tool to automate workflows. I will bring up different topics of ML in the form of short notes which can be of interest to existing practitioners and fresh enthusiasts alike.

The posts will cover topics like statistics, linear algebra, probability, data representation, modeling, computer vision among other things. I want this to be an incremental journey, starting from the basics and building up to more complex ideas.

hn62rt,Getting Started Applying Machine Learning,"Hi Everybody,

My name is Benjamin Ricard and I'm a senior PhD student in Quantitative Biomedical Sciences (read: Biomedical Data Sciences) at Dartmouth College. I currently work as a machine learning researcher ([published research here, not all ML](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=benjamin+j+ricard), my previous work was in biochemistry, biophysics and applied mathematics).  For the past 2 years I TAd the QBS 108 Applied Machine Learning class, but I've been tutoring and TAing for many years for my undergraduate and graduate education.

I've met a lot of very intelligent people that are interested in ML but think that maybe because they aren't computer scientists  or mathematicians that they can't do some really cool stuff in ML, and I think that's not true. I want to show people that you don't have to be an elite programmer (though obviously you can't be afraid to get your hands dirty!) to make some really powerful models; I've seen doctors, biologists, and finance people do it.

I'm working on recording a lot of the lectures and materials I've made and collected over the past few years. I've recorded two videos so far, but I'm definitely interested in making more. Any feedback would be very welcome!

Right now I'm doing practice projects for ml but I want to go more in depth and learn about what happens behind the state. Sure, i can keep on coding and go through books that teach me how to code better for ml but in the end, im just using existing functions and libraries to code. If I want to make something innovative with ml, it's pretty hard to do something innovative just by coding. Going through kaggle competition submissions helped me see that literally every submission in the top 50 had the exact same code. Learning how ml actually works is more important to me. So, what are some books or courses that go rigorously into the theory, math, and science behind machine learning? I don't have a super strong math background and I don't want to spend too much time getting stuck on learning the math so what are a few good shorter courses good for the math?


In short, what i want is a book that teaches stuff behind machine learning include deep learning rigorously so that by the end, i can end up creating my own algorithms just using my knowledge on theory. I want to spend more time working on developing new algorithms rather than creating my own code. What are some good books/courses for this?

ev61q6,"Student in College seeking advice: What are the top things I can do right now as a 21 year old, to better adapt to the future of machine learning?","I am a 21 year old college student in Canada who is very fascinated with the future of AI and machine learning. I will graduate this semester with a degree in Social Sciences with Math. How could I get a headstart on the trends which will be the future of this career? I am hearing many things on how Pytorch is an incredible library but people who started with Tenserflow are sticking to that, even though it is (allegedly) much more difficult and worse user interface. I have begun learning Python in my free time on [udemy.com](https://udemy.com), but I am only in the early stages. What can I do to thrive in this environment? 

I am fascinated by music, and I am very comfortable using Ableton Live 9, and quite advanced (been doing it for about 6 years now). There is a company who developed a program called Magenta, which can generate 2 bars of music based on something you give it as an input. For example, if I feed it Vivaldi's 8th symphony, it will generate a (freakishly coordinated and clean) output which sounds exactly like that last piece, but just different enough where it is a new composition entirely. I am also fascinated by VFX and compositing in softwares such as After Effects. I want to somehow mesh all of these together, but I don't know where to start. I feel like investing too much time in a way of coding that is not oriented around my future profession could be a waste of time, and amount to very little in the field I want to explore later in the future. Any and all tips are appreciated.

1afclio,It‚Äôs too much to prepare for a Data Science Interview,"This might sound like a rant or an excuse for preparation, but it is not, I am just stating a few facts. I might be wrong, but this just my experience and would love to discuss experience of other people. 

It‚Äôs not easy to get a good data science job. I‚Äôve been preparing for interviews, and companies need an all-in-one package.

The following are just the tip of the iceberg:
- Must-have stats and probability knowledge (applied stats).
- Must-have classical ML model knowledge with their positives, negatives, pros, and cons on datasets.
- Must-have EDA knowledge (which is similar to the first two points).
- Must-have deep learning knowledge (most industry is going in the deep learning path).
- Must-have mathematics of deep learning, i.e., linear algebra and its implementation.
- Must-have knowledge of modern nets (this can vary between jobs, for example, LLMs/transformers for NLP).
- Must-have knowledge of data engineering (extremely important to actually build a product).
- MLOps knowledge: deploying it using docker/cloud, etc.
- Last but not least: coding skills! (We can‚Äôt escape LeetCode rounds)

Other than all this technical, we also must have:
- Good communication skills.
- Good business knowledge (this comes with experience, they say).
- Ability to explain model results to non-tech/business stakeholders.

Other than all this, we also must have industry-specific technical knowledge, which includes data pipelines, model architectures and training, deployment, and inference.

It goes without saying that these things may or may not reflect on our resume. So even if we have these skills, we need to build and showcase our skills in the form of projects (so there‚Äôs that as well).

Anyways, it‚Äôs hard. But it is what it is; data science has become an extremely competitive field in the last few months. We gotta prepare really hard! Not get demotivated by failures.

I have researched eye strain before to improve my sleep. I decided to give a few suggestions. I will also summarise some of the answers in the thread.

ql2bbz,There's plenty in the data professions that is not glamorous,"When I was a 20-year-old recent college grad (who had studied econ, math, and stats), I spent the first six months of a job cleaning data, visualizing it, summarizing it, and preparing it. Mostly using Excel, some SQL, some SAS, some Stata. I forced in some R and Matlab because I felt restless, but no one needed or wanted that from me. In my first 6 months there, I was required to make exactly one (1!) regression model. That was just us kids being nervous and having something to prove.) 

I remember bristling with frustration because I'd just learned all these crazy cool techniques in college and I was using precisely zero of them. I thought there was something wrong with the job or the company. 

Now that I've got some experience, I understand that this is what the typical data job looks like. There are months of boring chores you have to do before you can make that one model that's genuinely useful. If you do a bunch of flashy stuff without the right prep work and stakeholder alignment, it'll likely go to waste.

isqtix,Andrew Ng programming exercises kinda weird,"I'm doing Andrew's Machine Learning course on Coursera and I'm really demotivated when it comes to the programming parts. 

I'm good with the math and the coding. When it comes to writing a cost function on Octave, I just sit a while to translate the equation to code, and it's done. 

But some exercises seem like a puzzle, just to understand what am I supposed to do. 

On week 6, ex5 learningCurve for example. It's supposed to be a simple learning curve plot. But there's so many exceptions and ""oh you should do just one sample here and change lambda there because idk just be like that"". Not to mention times that the calculus I learned just didn't work in the code (Theta transpose X never worked, I had to write X times Theta) . I was trying to understand wtf I had to do for 40min until I just googled a solution. 

It's the only thing that really holds me back from wanting to finish the course. Everything else is perfect. I want to know if there's somewhere I can better understand these exercises, like some ytb channel.

i0d6c5,Why do Most people not use Fast.Ai library ?,"So I went through the [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) course. I should mention that I was actually pretty familiar with keras before I took the course. After completing the course I realized that it is Insanely Easy to create Deep Learning Models using this Library. 

Creating a CNN with use of transfer learning is just a one liner. You can basically pick any architecture and set everything up in just a single line. You don't have to worry about over fitting your model, whereas in TF you have to basically set up each layer sequentially followed by dropouts and max pooling.

&#x200B;

Then there are other features like the lr\_finder which comes in very handy to pick a learning rate. Since 4 days, I had been attempting to do a deep-learning challenge  with TF and managed to get accuracy of 70%. I used the FastAI lib and it shot straight to a 90%. 

&#x200B;

However, I still don't see people using this lib. Keras is still a standard go to. Surely there must be some downsides to it.
