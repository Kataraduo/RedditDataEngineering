gy6j2w,[E] An entire stats course on YouTube (with R programming and commentary),"Yesterday I finished recording the last video for my online-only summer stats class, and today I uploaded it to YouTube. The videos are largely unedited because video editing takes time, which is something I as a PhD student needing to get these out fast don't have. (Nor am I being paid extra for it.) But they exist for the world to consume.

This is for MATH 3070 at the University of Utah, which is calculus-based statistics, officially titled ""Applied Statistics I"". This class comes with an R lab for novice programmers to learn enough R for statistical programming. The lecture notes used in all videos are available [here](http://www.math.utah.edu/~cmiller/classes/SU203070/).

Below are the playlists for the course, for those interested:

* [Intro stats](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8S7d85iiYRU4CgJplDAnO5LvL2hNAqz5), the lecture component of the course where the mathematics and procedures are presented and discussed
* [Intro R](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8S7d85iiYRUwhpqKyhHQbqXUjXbEC9jC), the R lab component, where I teach R
* [Stats Aside](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8S7d85iiYRVGvHgRTwt-VU0NxNB4iTCf) for topics that are not really required but good to know, and the one video series I would be willing to continue if people actually liked it.

k88ifr,[D] Very disturbed by the ignorance and complete rejection of valid statistical principles and anti-intellectualism overall.,"Statistics is quite a big part of my career, so I was very disturbed when my stereotypical boomer father was listening to [sermon](https://www.gracechurch.org/live) that just consisted of COVID denial, but specifically there was the quote:

“You have a 99.9998% chance of not getting COVID. The vaccine is 94% effective. I wouldn't want to lower my chances.”

Of course this resulted in thunderous applause from the congregation, but I was just taken aback at how readily such a foolish statement like this was accepted. This is a church with 8,000 members, and how many people like this are spreading notions like this across the country? There doesn't seem to be any critical thinking involved, people just readily accept that all the data being put out is fake, or alternatively pick up out elements from studies that support their views. For example, in the same sermon, Johns Hopkins was cited as a renowned medical institution and it supposedly tested 140,000 people in hospital settings and only 27 had COVID, but even if that is true, they ignore everything else JHU says.

This pandemic has really exemplified how a worrying amount of people simply do not care, and I worry about the implications this has not only for statistics but for society overall.",432,88,VReview,2020-12-07 03:18:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/k88ifr/d_very_disturbed_by_the_ignorance_and_complete/,0,statistics

1bedcfp,[D] Gaza War casualty numbers are “statistically impossible”,"
I thought this was interesting and a concept I’m unfamiliar with : naturally occurring numbers 

“In an article published by Tablet Magazine on Thursday, statistician Abraham Wyner argues that the official number of Palestinian casualties reported daily by the Gaza Health Ministry from 26 October to 11 November 2023 is evidently “not real”, which he claims is obvious ""to anyone who understands how naturally occurring numbers work.”

Professor Wyner of UPenn writes:

“The graph of total deaths by date is increasing with almost metronomical linearity,” with the increase showing “strikingly little variation” from day to day.

“The daily reported casualty count over this period averages 270 plus or minus about 15 per cent,” Wyner writes. “There should be days with twice the average or more and others with half or less. Perhaps what is happening is the Gaza ministry is releasing fake daily numbers that vary too little because they do not have a clear understanding of the behaviour of naturally occurring numbers.”

EDIT:many comments agree with the first point, some disagree, but almost none have addressed this point which is inherent to his findings: **“As second point of evidence, Wyner examines the rate at of child casualties compared to that of women, arguing that the variation should track between the two groups”**

“This is because the daily variation in death counts is caused by the variation in the number of strikes on residential buildings and tunnels which should result in considerable variability in the totals but less variation in the percentage of deaths across groups,” Wyner writes. “This is a basic statistical fact about chance variability.”


https://www.thejc.com/news/world/hamas-casualty-numbers-are-statistically-impossible-says-data-science-professor-rc0tzedc

That above article also relies on data from the following graph:

https://tablet-mag-images.b-cdn.net/production/f14155d62f030175faf43e5ac6f50f0375550b61-1206x903.jpg?w=1200&q=70&auto=format&dpr=1

**“…we should see variation in the number of child casualties that tracks the variation in the number of women. This is because the daily variation in death counts is caused by the variation in the number of strikes on residential buildings and tunnels which should result in considerable variability in the totals but less variation in the percentage of deaths across groups. This is a basic statistical fact about chance variability.**

**Consequently, on the days with many women casualties there should be large numbers of children casualties, and on the days when just a few women are reported to have been killed, just a few children should be reported. This relationship can be measured and quantified by the R-square (R2 ) statistic that measures how correlated the daily casualty count for women is with the daily casualty count for children. If the numbers were real, we would expect R2 to be substantively larger than 0, tending closer to 1.0. But R2 is .017 which is statistically and substantively not different from 0.”**

j0zqs7,I hate data science: a rant [C]," 

I'm kind of in career despair being basically a statistician posing as a data scientist. In my last two positions I've felt like juniors and peers really look up to and respect my knowledge of statistics but senior leadership does not really value stats at all. I feel like I'm constantly being pushed into being what is basically a software developer or IT guy and getting asked to look into BS projects. Senior leadership I think views stats as very basic (they just think of t-tests and logistic regression \[which they think is a classification algorithm\] but have no idea about things like GAMs, multi-level models, Bayesian inference, etc).

In the last few years, I've really doubled down on stats which, even though it has given me more internal satisfaction, has certainly slowed my career progress. I'm sort of at the can't-beat-em-join-em point now, where I think maybe just developing these skills that I've been resisting will actually do me some good. I guess using some random python package to do fuzzy matching of data or something like that wouldn't kill me.

Basically everyone just invented this ""data scientist"" position and it has caused a gold rush. I certainly can't complain about being able to bring home a great salary but since data science caught on I feel like the position has actually become filled with less and less competent people, to the point that people in these positions do not even know very basic stats or even just some common sense empiricism.

All-in-all, I can't complain. It's not like I'm about to get fired for loving statistics. And I admit that maybe I am wrong. I feel like someone could write a well-articulated post about how stats is a small part of data science relative to production deployments, data cleansing, blah blah and it would be well received and maybe true.

I guess what I'm getting at is just being a cautionary tale that if statistics is your true passion, you may find the data science field extremely frustrating at times.

192fkms,[Career] I fear I need to leave my job as a biostatistician after 10 years: I just cannot remember anything I've learned.,"I'm a researcher at a good university, but I can never remember fundamental information, like what a Z test looks like. I worry I need to quit my job because I get so stressed out by the possibility of people realising how little I know.

I studied mathematics and statistics at undergrad, statistics at masters, clinical trial design at PhD, but I feel like nothing has gone into my brain.

My job involves 50% working in applied clinical trials, which is mostly simple enough for me to cope with. The other 50% sometimes involves teaching very clever students, which I find terrifying. I don't remember how to work with expectations or variances, or derive a sample size calculation from first principles, or why sometimes the variance is sigma^(2) and other times it's sigma^(2)/n. Maybe I never knew these things.

Why I haven't lost my job: probably because of the applied work, which I can mostly do okay, and because I'm good at programming and teaching students how to program, which is becoming a bigger part of my job.

I could applied work only, but then I wouldn't be able to teach programming or do much programming at all, which is the part of my job I like the most.

I've already cut down on the methodological work I do because I felt hopeless. Now I don't feel I can teach these students with any confidence. I don't know what to do.

Additionally, suppose that the lifetime of a celebrity feud is exponentially distributed with unknown rate λ and that λ has a gamma(a,b) distribution. After sampling celebrity feuds (such as Kylie Jenner vs. Jordyn Woods, Lauren Conrad vs. Heidi Montag, and Naomi Campbell vs. Tyra Banks), their lifetimes are recorded as X1,...,Xn.

85xp2c,"This sub is a microcosm of the field of statistics, which isn't a good thing","This is a rant.

For a little background on this rant, I have two academic biostatisticians in my immediate family, including one who recently retired. I am an academic epidemiologist who functions as an applied statistician in much of my work.

The most common complaint I hear from biostatisticians about their jobs is that their time is grossly under-appreciated. One of the statisticians in my family has related countless stories to me of being put grants to do data analysis at 2-5% funding. For non-academics, this is like someone paying for an hour or two of your time. In my experience, this is enough to attend a weekly or biweekly meeting and answer occasional high-level questions about stats. It is not nearly enough to do data analysis. 

This reflects a larger pattern that statisticians are viewed as essentially the backbone of an academic service sector. 

That's what this sub is. I can't recall the last time I saw a post from /r/statistics show up in my feed that was remotely interesting. It's almost exclusively people with little to no statistical training essentially getting free statistics consulting. While I find it fun to help people, I no longer see the value in using my hard fought knowledge to support other people's work on this subreddit. Many of us could be making good money for the type of advice we hand out here, but instead we are left answering homework questions or helping out researchers who should be paying for another statistician's time.

I can't, in good conscience, keep providing for free what others should be getting paid for.

I wish I had a solution for this sub other than just quitting it. /r/machinelearning recently had a post that was very similar to this one, and the sub went through major changes. Now, there is a lot of interesting content about current research that gets posted there, and the incessant string of ""how does backpropogation work?""-type questions came to a swift end. I don't have time or energy to moderate that kind of sub, but I'm worried that my views represent the views of a lot of subscribers to this sub who no longer see the worth of it. Some ideas would be: weekly discussion of items from Andrew Gelman's blog; journal clubs; debates; AMAs; anything but homework problems.

I wish I had more solutions, but I've at least decided to stop being part of the problem by boycotting the overwhelming onslaught of posts that ask absurdly basic questions. If you are an academic and you need someone to help you with an analysis: include some money in a grant to keep a statistician employed. If you are a student, ask your TA.

oh2uxn,[Q] Would you be interested in a website where you can play competitive games which require you to use your probability and statistics knowledge?,"Hi all! We're thinking about making a website where you can practice your probability and statistics knowledge by playing competitive games. Is this something that you would be interested in trying out?
Thanks in advance!

UPDATE: Thank you for all the replies! We appreciate the feedback.
We are just starting to develop this platform and the games haven't been created yet so everything is subject to change. We wanted to see if there's any interest although we understand it's hard to determine without providing you with actual ideas.
Here are clarifications to some of your questions:

The original conception of the games (by our team leader) is to be against other people (multiplayer) in real time. The duration of a game is on the scale of half an hour to an hour. There won't be any out of pocket expenses!

The games are intended to be on the level of an undergraduate probability and statistics/data analysis course. Programming will be involved. One of the main motivations for the games is to help university students reinforce/practice their knowledge in an engaging way.

As far as we are aware, the competitions on Kaggle are over a long time span which isn't what we wanted.

Thank you again for all your feedback! We have resolved to embark on this journey to develop this platform and we aim to share updates in the future.",221,36,periperimoon,2021-07-09 19:32:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/oh2uxn/q_would_you_be_interested_in_a_website_where_you/,0,statistics

7w318r,"""It is part of the human condition that we are statistically punished for rewarding others and rewarded for punishing them"" - Kahneman in his 2002 Nobel Prize Speech.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292229/

>I had the most satisfying Eureka experience of my career while attempting to teach flight instructors that praise is more effective than punishment for promoting skill-learning. When I had finished my enthusiastic speech, one of the most seasoned instructors in the audience raised his hand and made his own short speech, which began by conceding that positive reinforcement might be good for the birds, but went on to deny that it was optimal for flight cadets. He said, “On many occasions I have praised flight cadets for clean execution of some aerobatic maneuver, and in general when they try it again, they do worse. On the other hand, I have often screamed at cadets for bad execution, and in general they do better the next time. So please don't tell us that reinforcement works and punishment does not, because the opposite is the case.” This was a joyous moment, in which I understood an important truth about the world: because we tend to reward others when they do well and punish them when they do badly, and because there is regression to the mean, it is part of the human condition that we are statistically punished for rewarding others and rewarded for punishing them. I immediately arranged a demonstration in which each participant tossed two coins at a target behind his back, without any feedback. We measured the distances from the target and could see that those who had done best the first time had mostly deteriorated on their second try, and vice versa. But I knew that this demonstration would not undo the effects of lifelong exposure to a perverse contingency.

They include lecture notes and exercises on the following: The use of digital writing tools, ways to combine equations and language, citations and intellectual property, reporting statistical results, types of academic and industrial publications, verbal presentations, posters, surveys and questionnaires, technical writing, data dictionaries, and consulting.

I've tried to adapt these notes to be independent and distance-learning friendly as I could in a PDF.

c3vud9,"My problem with ""data science""","So in the last weeks for various reasons I have been meeting with individuals that identified as data scientists, or that had taken several courses, wether online or in a university, of data science.

What I realized is that most of this programs do not actually provide the necessary tools for doing a correct statistical analysis. They focus on visual presentation of results and some coding (which don't get me wrong, is quite important), but they do not teach what you actually need to do a good project: statistical theory ( and maybe some maths to understand the insides of the processes, but if all they do is of an applied nature, I think this is more of secondary importance).

As a result, I have seen projects which , even if they are very pretty to look at, show a lack of understanding of some basic  ideas of statistics, such as running an OLS regression with no or few controls in a non-experimental setting and claiming to have found a causal relationship between the variables.

In my case I can tell to an extent what is wrong with the design or methodology of the project, but I wonder, now that data science seems to be all the rage, how many people with similar skills have been hired by bussinesses that do not have people with knowledge of statistics, and as result can't know what is wrong with what they do.

jo0e5f,"[D] Data science might be a bubble reminiscent of the 90s ""dot com"" crash","This is **my opinion**, and mine alone. I'm interested in community opinions in response, see questions at bottom.

**Some trends in data science that are worrisome:**

\- Big tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon,...) are first and foremost computer science organizations. Do they employ statisticians? Of course. But CS is driving the narrative of what ""data science"" is. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I'm not convinced it's a good thing, either.

\- Machine learning has become boiled down to regression, classification, and clustering. Statistics is often just as interested in predictive accuracy as in inferring relations between variables. (ie ""*How much does a small increase in price affect customer demand*?"" versus binary (y/n) ""*will a customer purchase this product?*"") Of course prediction, alone, **is** a powerful tool. But it doesn't require complete domain or statistical knowledge. Emphasis has been placed on API knowledge (ie sklearn) and feature engineering know-how. As a consequence, access to (and demand for) intro level ML education material has exploded. Due to the supply and demand relationship, I believe it's only a matter of time before the market reaches its pandas/sklearn practitioner ""carrying capacity.""

\- Interest in natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning has skyrocketed. Google, for example, has touted 77% accuracy on BERT's natural language reasoning performance. However, recently studies have been done where wording on these tasks has been altered in subtle ways, [triggering dramatic drops in performance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07355.pdf). The study suggests that performance on boilerplate datasets has become the gold standard; cynically, I believe Google and the like are incentivized to maximize performance on these datasets due to a strong effect on the company's valuation.

\- Big data problems invite (but don't necessarily require) big data solutions. Neural networks are, in my opinion, overfit machines; they only produce state of the art results, when the sample is so large that it  converges on the population size. (ex Google allocates server resources, most companies simply don't have to train state of the art models.) Nonetheless, it appears that big data solutions have been overestimated in their relevance to problems most organizations face. (Segue: I find that Bayesian statistics are far more powerful when data size is limited.)

Edit: Transfer learning does exist such that learned features from RES-NET, for example, can be passed to a new model with a different (but related) task (ex classifying pictures as ""cat"" or ""dog"".) I have limited experience with transfer learning, so this **is** anecdotal: I was unimpressed. Can discuss in comments upon request.    

\- Google and Amazon are incorporating ML tools into their cloud infrastructures and making access to training/certification materials very accessible. This is reminiscent of Amazon's ""prime strategy"" where they accepted a loss in profits in the short-term to secure a sizeable market share. Once customers were ""hooked"", they correctly predicted that customers would be hesitant to leave. I hardly have to put my imagination to work in picturing myself learning ML within the context of AWS or Google Cloud; I'd be extremely incentivized to maintain usage of said stack, and I'd potentially lose the ability to migrate my business to an alternate platform. In consequence, this could mean that mastery of ML is measured by familiarity with AWS and/or Google Cloud in the long run. (I don't see this being true for research scientists at PhD level, but more likely for entry level analyst/data scientist roles.)

\- Big picture: I believe CS-dominated corporations are defining data science in terms of highly flexible models, achieving high accuracy on large data sets and marginalizing the importance of understanding variable relationships, interactions, etc. Further, I believe that big tech companies are incentivized to foster a belief that these methods are applicable to any business across the spectrum, regardless of size and/or function. And lastly, if smaller companies were to lose profits over the results of these models, there might be backlash, where demand for data scientist would collapse to its true carrying capacity and most companies wouldn't know how to evaluate whether someone ""knew their stuff."" This could mean highly variable job market.

**Questions:**

\- Am I overly cynical, reading too much into the ""tea leaves"", etc?

\- How should statistics-oriented data scientists gain a larger sphere of influence in ""what data science is""?

\- Anything else you'd like to add?",188,101,None,2020-11-04 17:04:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/jo0e5f/d_data_science_might_be_a_bubble_reminiscent_of/,0,statistics

For e.g sklearn's default L2 regularization comes to mind. Blog link: [https://ryxcommar.com/2019/08/30/scikit-learns-defaults-are-wrong/](https://ryxcommar.com/2019/08/30/scikit-learns-defaults-are-wrong/)

On requesting correction, the developers reply "" scikit-learn is a machine learning package. Don’t expect it to be like a statistics package.""

Given this context, My belief is that the developer of any software / tool designed for statisticians have statistics / Maths background.

What do you think ?

Edit: My goal is not to bash sklearn. I use it to a good degree. Rather my larger intent was to highlight the attitude that some developers will brow beat statisticians for not knowing production grade coding. Yet when they develop statistics modules, nobody points it out to them that they need to know statistical concepts really well.",175,107,venkarafa,2021-12-08 19:09:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/rbyj6g/d_people_without_statistics_background_should_not/,0,statistics
i4c6e3,Does anyone else feel like some data science firms are predatory? [D],"I've been noticing that there are a lot of data science firms out there coming to big companies and selling fairly bunk data science solutions to execs for pretty massive amounts of money.

And I guess I should be explicit that I'm noticing it at my own company. Ive been called in to consult on a few of these internally, and I'm seeing a lot of people pitch decision trees or a simple set of sklearn commands as ""next gen AI"" to our execs. What really concerns me isnt even that these are solutions any decent statistician could offer, it's that a lot of the problems arent even appropriate for the advanced solutions they offer. 

Like solving an SQC process monitoring problem as a Random Forest, because the one thing that is not Random about the Random Forest is that it's going to get offered to you as ""Our Proprietary Advanced Machine Learning Models"". I legit had someone try to sell us a forecasting model as RF before even trying ARMIAX.

Anyways, the whole thing strikes me as predatory. I've started taking a bit more of an activist approach to this, because I am kind of worried that our execs are out there buying these things and wasting money that we desperately need. 

It's like trying to stop the king from buying magic beans.

But it sucks because I have to do it in a way that doesnt sandbag me when I actually need to use a Random Forest. So like, buy my beans, not theirs.

10w51w2,[D] I'm so sick of being ripped off by statistics software companies.,"For info, I am a PhD student. My stipend is 12,500 a year and I have to pay  for this shit myself. Please let me know if I am being irrational.

Two  years ago, I purchased access to a 4-year student version of MPlus. One  year ago, my laptop which had the software on it died. I got a new  laptop and went to the Muthen & Muthen website to log-in and  re-download my software. I went to my completed purchases tab and  clicked on my license to download it, and was met with a message that my  ""Update and Support License"" had expired. I wasn't trying to update  anything, I was only trying to download what i already purchased but  okay. I contacted customer service and they fed me some bullshit about  how they ""don't keep old versions of MPlus"" and that I should have  backed up the installer because that is the only way to regain access if  you lose it. I find it hard to believe that a company doesn't have an  archive of old versions, especially RECENT old versions, and again- why  wouldn't that just be easily accessible from my account? Because they  want my money, that's why. Okay, so now I don't have MPlus and refuse to  buy it again as long as I can help it.

Now  today I am having issues with SPSS. I recently got a desktop computer  and looked to see if my license could be downloaded on multiple  computers. Apparently it can be used on two computers- sweet! So I went  to my email and found the receipt from the IBM-selected vendor that I  had to purchased from. Apparently, my access to my download key was only  valid for 2 weeks. I could have paid $6.00 at the time to maintain  access to the download key for 2 years, but since I didn't do that, I  now have to pay a $15.00 ""retrieval fee"" for their customer support to  get it for me. Yes, this stuff was all laid out in the email when I  purchased so yes, I should have prepared for this, and yes, it's not  that expensive to recover it now (especially compared to buying the  entire product again like MPlus wanted me to do) but come on. This is  just another way for companies to nickel and dime us.

Is it just me or is this ridiculous? How are people okay with this??

EDIT: I was looking back at my emails with Muthen & Muthen and forgot about this gem! When I had added my ""Update & Support"" license renewal to my cart, a late fee and prorated months were included for some reason, making my total $331.28. But if I bought a brand new license it would have been $195.00. Can't help but wonder if that is another intentional money grab.",165,146,dammit_sammy,2023-02-07 15:47:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/10w51w2/d_im_so_sick_of_being_ripped_off_by_statistics/,0,statistics
18xuavt,[C] How do you push back against pressure to p-hack?,"I'm an early-career biostatistician in an academic research dept. This is not so much a statistical question as it is a ""how do I assert myself as a professional"" question. I'm feeling pressured to essentially p-hack by a couple investigators and I'm looking for your best tips on how to handle this. I'm actually more interested in general advice you may have on this topic vs advice that only applies to this specific scenario but I'll still give some more context.

They provided me with data and questions. For one question, there's a continuous predictor and a binary outcome, and in a logistic regression model the predictor ain't significant. So the researchers want me to dichotomize the predictor, then try again. I haven't gotten back to them yet but it's still nothing. I'm angry at myself that I even tried their bad suggestion instead of telling them that we lose power and generalizability of whatever we might learn when we dichotomize.

This is only one of many questions they are having me investigate. With the others, they have also pushed when things have not been as desired. They know enough to be dangerous, for example, asking for all pairwise time-point comparisons instead of my suggestion to use a single longitudinal model, saying things like ""I don't think we need to worry about within-person repeated measurements"" when it's not burdensome to just do the right thing and include the random effects term. I like them, personally, but I'm getting stressed out about their very directed requests. I think there probably should have been an analysis plan in place to limit this iterativeness/""researcher degrees of freedom"" but I came into this project midway.",166,49,blumenbloomin,2024-01-03 21:14:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/18xuavt/c_how_do_you_push_back_against_pressure_to_phack/,0,statistics

nbihwy,[C] I'm in Six Sigma Training and the course director told us statisticians don't really know stats,"I have my masters degree in statistics and I've noticed that during this training, a lot of the black belts have no idea what they're talking about. While the main course instructor is an amazing engineer, he does tend to say that what I learned in my degree program is incorrect because my uppity stats professors do not understand true stats because they've adapted or changed the ""original"" meaning of things, therefore what they say and what I learned is irrelevant and not true. And I'm not paraphrasing. This is what they said word by word. My argument to this is, why should I believe you? They seem to be looking down at people with a Phd in statistics since they claim they don't understand true stats. I find it hard to believe that an engineer knows stats better than well known statisticians from a top-10 stats program. I find that I am unable to suspend my disbelief and feel like I'm becoming quite resistant to the learning process, even though I would like to keep an open mind. I just find it hard to believe that my professors are all poorly informed and don't know anything, while the engineers understand true stats.

Someone explain this to me please? Is this normal for 6 Sigma? It has honestly really turned me off towards the whole thing. I think I'm struggling because I have a lot of respect and admiration for a lot of my professors--I still speak to my advisor even though I graduated years ago.

b48e3p,I feel that a major reason of these statistical misconceptions in science is that statistics as a discipline isnt respected as much as it should be,"In most scientific departments statistics is taught and viewed simply as a technical formality that you need in order to do a proper research. Instead of the introductory stats classes being presented as giving a general view of the interdisciplinary language of sciences (=statistics), students get the impression that they can actually conduct statistical analysis by themselves.

 Imagine if non-law students who take civil law courses (most social sciences and humanities disciplines have those) believed that they wouldnt need a lawyer if they got into legal trouble. Or if biologists thought that they can do the job of the doctor because they had some courses on human physiology.

 Yet in the case of statistics there are so many researchers who run quantitative research and think that they dont need consultancy from an actual statistician. How low your opinion on statistics as a discipline must be in order to think that? 

 I maybe sound elitist or gatekeeper, but this isnt my intention. I just want statistics to get the same respect and recognition that any other scientific specialty gets.

13qrll4,[Education] [PSA] [Rant] Don't you dare write or post about Gamma distributions without saying what parameterization you are using.,"I mean, really. I've spent the last several days working a model involving old-school ARD priors for factor weights, using a Gamma prior, and related topics.

And ALMOST NONE of the 100+ web pages and PDFs I've been reading EVER take the simple step of explicitly saying what parameterization for Gamma they are referring to in their paper/post. Is it shape? Is it rate? Who knows? 

No, I don't know what's common in your discipline. And I suspect  you don't, either.

No, I can't know for sure just because you use a ""beta"" instead of a ""theta"". Sure, the wikipedia notation is more popular than it used to be, but not everyone uses those consistently.

So if you are one of those people that write about the Gamma distribution without explicitly saying whether you are using shape, rate (or some other!!) parameterization, YOU ARE A BAD PERSON. May all your models fail to converge. May all your reviewers be ""Reviewer #3"". May your IRB committee require you to get informed consent in triplicate not just from subjects, but from subject's parents and grandparents and roomates' cousins' uncles.

My next PSA will be called: ""If you use priors in a paper with empirical results but never tell us what numbers you used for your top-level priors, YOU ARE A BAD PERSON.

11o1cmi,[D] Job more challenging than university,"Hi all! I work as a statistician in an factory. I would like to share my experience with you to know if it is common or not. For many reasons I find my current job more challenging than (or as challenging as) university. I had no difficulties during the first 3 years of university, while the fourth and the fifth year where tough but I finished with high final grades. Before getting a job, I did not expect to encounter so many difficulties at work. There are many things that troubles me:

* I realise I don't have much experience. I focused most of my time as a student to study statistics rather than to analyse many datasets. I still see myself as a beginner. I learn from every analysis. I always feel like I am not good enough and that data can be analysed in a better way.
* Datasets are more messy than university. It is very common to deal with outliers, short and/or intermittent time series, biases, etc.... Moreover data wrangling can take a considerable amount of time. I struggle a lot to get exactly the chart I want to report (maybe I need more time to get handy at using ggplot2)
* It is ridiculously easy to spend too much time doing a project
* I don't remember all the details of the methods I studied at university. Sometimes I feel the need to  revise some topics but there is not much time to do that. Sometimes I need to make decisions which I don't know fully how they would affect further analyses.
* At university it is obvious which methods are more appropriate to use for a specific dataset. Except for prediction problems, sometimes it is not easy to choose which method to use
* Sometimes it is not easy to think statistically
* I have poor social skills and talking is very important
* I tend to overthink about work a lot, even when I am not in the office. Having no teammates does not help either. I often feel the need to discuss with other statisticians but I don't have anyone to talk to except for online communities
* I often feel that the amount of effort I put in an analysis is not rewarded enough. I always compare my analyses with what I learnt at university. My analyses still look quite rough
* I feel a lot of pressure to solve tasks in a short time and get easily exhausted

Is it common ? Will it get better? Should I quit my job?

myinjq,"[D] 7 years since Norm Matloff's blog post ""STATISTICS: LOSING GROUND TO CS, LOSING IMAGE AMONG STUDENTS"". How has the statistics vs CS situation evolved?"," [Statistics: Losing Ground to CS, Losing Image Among Students | Mad (Data) Scientist (wordpress.com)](https://matloff.wordpress.com/2014/08/26/statistics-losing-ground-to-cs-losing-image-among-students/)

I will quote the blog post below.

# STATISTICS: LOSING GROUND TO CS, LOSING IMAGE AMONG STUDENTS

The American Statistical Association (ASA)  leadership, and many in Statistics academia. have been undergoing a period of angst the last few years,  They worry that the field of Statistics is headed for a future of reduced national influence and importance, with the feeling that:

* The field is to a large extent being usurped by other disciplines, notably Computer Science (CS).
* Efforts to make the field attractive to students have largely been unsuccessful.

I had been aware of these issues for quite a while, and thus was pleasantly surprised last year to see then-ASA president Marie Davidson write [a plaintive editorial](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2013/07/01/datascience/) titled, “Aren’t *We* Data Science?”

Good, the ASA is taking action, I thought.  But even then I was startled to learn during [JSM 2014](http://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2014/) (a conference tellingly titled “Statistics:  Global Impact, Past, Present and Future”) that the ASA leadership is so concerned about these problems that it has now retained a PR firm.

This is probably a wise move–most large institutions engage in extensive PR in one way or another–but it is a sad statement about how complacent the profession has become.  Indeed, it can be argued that the action is long overdue; as a friend of mine put it, “They \[the statistical profession\] lost the PR war because they never fought it.”

In this post, I’ll tell you the rest of the story, as I see it, viewing events as a statistician, computer scientist and R enthusiasist.

# CS vs. Statistics

Let’s consider the CS issue first.  Recently a number of new terms have arisen, such as *data science*, *Big Data*, and *analytics*, and the popularity of the term *machine learning* has grown rapidly.  To many of us, though, this is just  “old wine in new bottles,” with the “wine” being Statistics.  But the new “bottles” are disciplines outside of Statistics–especially CS.

I have a foot in both the Statistics and CS camps.  I’ve spent most of my career in the Computer Science Dept. at the University of California, Davis, but I began my career in Statistics at that institution.  My mathematics [doctoral thesis](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aop/1176995798) at UCLA was in probability theory, and my first years on the faculty at Davis focused on [statistical methodology](http://biomet.oxfordjournals.org/content/68/3/685.abstract).  I was one of the [seven charter members ](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/about/history)of the Department of Statistics.   Though my departmental affiliation later changed to CS, I never left Statistics as a field, and most of my research in Computer Science has been [statistical in nature](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1103326).  With such “dual loyalties,” I’ll refer to people in both professions via third-person pronouns, not first, and I will be critical of both groups.  (A friend who read a draft of this post joked it should be titled “J’accuse”  but of course this is not my intention.)   However, in keeping with the theme of the ASA’s recent actions, my essay will be Stat-centric:  What is poor Statistics to do?

Well then, how did CS come to annex the Stat field?  The primary cause, I believe, came from the CS subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI).  Though there always had been some probabilistic analysis in AI, in recent years the interest has been almost exclusively in predictive analysis–a core area of Statistics.

That switch in AI was due largely to the emergence of Big Data.  No one really knows what the term means, but people “know it when they see it,” and they see it quite often these days.  Typical data sets range from large to huge to astronomical (sometimes literally the latter, as cosmology is one of the application fields), necessitating that one pay key attention to the computational aspects.  Hence the term *data science*, combining quantitative methods with speedy computation, and hence another reason for CS to become involved.

Involvement is one thing, but usurpation is another.  Though not a deliberate action by any means, CS is eclipsing Stat in many of Stat’s central areas.  This is dramatically demonstrated by statements that are made like,  “With machine learning methods, you don’t need statistics”–a punch in the gut for statisticians who realize that machine learning really IS statistics.  ML goes into great detail in certain aspects, e.g. text mining, but in essence it consists of parametric and nonparametric curve estimation methods from Statistics, such as logistic regression, LASSO, nearest-neighbor classification, random forests, the EM algorithm and so on.

Though the Stat leaders seem to regard all this as something of an existential threat to the well-being of their profession, I view it as much worse than that.  The problem is not that CS people are doing Statistics, but rather that they are doing it poorly:  Generally the quality of CS work in Stat is weak.  It is not a problem of quality of the researchers themselves; indeed, many of them are very highly talented.  Instead, there are a number of **systemic reasons** for this, structural problems with the CS research “business model”:

* **CS, having grown out of research on fast-changing software and hardware systems, became accustomed to the “24-hour news cycle”**–very rapid publication rates, with the venue of choice being (refereed) frequent conferences rather than slow journals.  This leads to research work being less thoroughly conducted, and less thoroughly reviewed, resulting in poorer quality work.  The fact that some prestigious conferences have acceptance rates in the teens or even lower doesn’t negate these realities.
* Because CS Depts. at research universities tend to be housed in Colleges of Engineering, there is **heavy pressure to bring in lots of research funding, and produce lots of PhD student**s.  Large amounts of time is spent on trips to schmooze funding agencies and industrial sponsors,  writing grants, meeting conference deadlines and managing a small army of doctoral students–instead of time spent in careful, deep, long-term contemplation about the problems at hand.  This is made even worse by the rapid change in the fashionable research topic *de jour,* making it difficult to go into a topic in any real depth.  Offloading the actual research onto a large team of grad students can result in faculty not fully applying the talents they were hired for; I’ve seen too many cases in which the thesis adviser is not sufficiently aware of what his/her students are doing.
* **There is rampant “reinventing the wheel.”**  The above-mentioned  lack of “adult supervision” and lack of long-term commitment to research topics results in weak knowledge of the literature.  This is especially true for knowledge of the Stat literature, which even the “adults” tend to have very little awareness of.  For instance, consider a paper on the use of mixed labeled and unlabeled training data in classification.  (I’ll omit names.)   One of the two authors is one of the most prominent names in the machine learning field, and the paper has been cited over 3,000 times, yet the paper cites nothing in the extensive Stat literature on this topic, consisting of a long stream of papers from 1981 to the present.
* Again for historical reasons, CS research is largely empirical/experimental in nature.  This causes what in my view is **one of the most serious problems plaguing CS research in Stat–lack of rigor**.  Mind you, I am not saying that every paper should consist of theorems and proofs or be overly abstract; data- and/or simulation-based studies are fine.  But there is no substitute for precise thinking, and in my experience, many (nominally) successful CS researchers in Stat do not have a solid understanding of the fundamentals underlying the problems they work on.  For example, a recent paper in a top CS conference incorrectly stated that the logistic classification model cannot handle non-monotonic relations between the predictors and response variable; the paper really stressed this point, yet actually, one can add quadratic terms and so on to model this.
* **This “engineering-style” research model causes a cavalier attitude towards underlying models and assumptions.**  Most empirical work in CS doesn’t have any models to worry about.  That’s entirely  appropriate, but in my observation it creates a mentality that inappropriately carries over when CS researchers do Stat work.  A few years ago, for instance, I attended a talk by a machine learning specialist who had just earned her PhD at one of the very top CS Departments  in the world.  She had taken a Bayesian approach to the problem she worked on, and I asked her why she had chosen that specific prior distribution.  She couldn’t answer–she had just blindly used what her thesis adviser had given her–and moreover, she was baffled as to why anyone would want to know why that prior was chosen.
* **Again due to the history of the field, CS people tend to have grand, starry-eyed ambitions–laudable, but a double-edged sword.**   On the one hand, this is a  huge plus, leading to highly impressive feats such as [recognizing faces in a crowd.](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2014/8/177012-hello-my-name-is/fulltext)  But this mentality leads to  an oversimplified view of things,  with everything being viewed as a paradigm shift.  Neural networks epitomize this problem.  Enticing phrasing such as “Neural networks work like the human brain” blinds many researchers to the fact that neural nets are not fundamentally different from other parametric and nonparametric methods for regression and classification.   (Recently I was pleased to discover–“learn,” if you must–that the famous book by [Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/local.ftp/Springer/OLD/ESLII_print4.pdf) complains about what they call “hype” over neural networks; sadly, theirs is a rare voice on this matter.)  Among CS folks, there is often a failure to understand that the celebrated accomplishments of “machine learning” have been mainly the result of applying a lot of money, a lot of people time, a lot of computational power and prodigious amounts of tweaking to the given problem–not because fundamentally new technology has been invented.

All this matters–a LOT.  In my opinion, the above factors result in highly lamentable opportunity costs.   Clearly, I’m not saying that people in CS should stay out of Stat research.  But the sad truth is that the usurpation process is causing precious resources–research funding, faculty slots, the best potential grad students, attention from government policymakers, even attention from the press–to go quite disproportionately to CS, even though Statistics is arguably better equipped to make use of them.   This is not a CS vs. Stat issue; Statistics is important to the nation and to the world, and if scarce resources aren’t being used well, it’s everyone’s loss.

# Making Statistics Attractive to Students

This of course is an age-old problem in Stat.  Let’s face it–the very word *statistics* sounds hopelessly dull.  But I would argue that a more modern development is making the problem a lot worse–the Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics courses in high schools.

Professor Xiao-Li Meng has written extensively about the [destructive nature of AP Stat](https://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/tast.2009.pdf).  He observed, “Among Harvard undergraduates I asked, the most frequent reason for not considering a statistical major was a ‘turn-off’ experience in an AP statistics course.”  That says it all, doesn’t it?  And though Meng’s views predictably sparked [defensive replies ](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2009/11/01/statviewnov09/)in some quarters, I’ve had exactly the same experiences as Meng in my own interactions with students.  No wonder students would rather major in a field like CS and study machine learning–without realizing it is Statistics.  It is especially troubling that Statistics may be losing the “best and brightest” students.

One of the major problems is that AP Stat is usually taught by people who lack depth in the subject matter.  A typical example is that a student complained to me that even though he had attended a top-quality high school in the heart of Silicon Valley, his AP Stat teacher could not answer his question as to why it is customary to use n-1 rather than n in the denominator of s2 .  But even that lapse is really minor, compared to the lack among the AP teachers of the broad overview typically possessed by Stat professors teaching university courses, in terms of what can be done with Stat, what the philosophy is, what the concepts really mean and so on.  AP courses are ostensibly college level, but the students are not getting college-level instruction.  The “teach to the test” syndrome that pervades AP courses in general exacerbates this problem.

The most exasperating part of all this is that AP Stat officially relies on TI-83 pocket calculators as its computational vehicle.  The machines are expensive, and after all we are living in an age in which R is free!  Moreover, the calculators don’t have the capabilities of dazzling graphics and analyzing of nontrivial data sets that R provides–exactly the kinds of things that motivate young people.

So, unlike the “CS usurpation problem,” whose solution is unclear, here is something that actually  can be fixed reasonably simply.  If I had my druthers, I would simply ban AP Stat, and actually, I am one of those people who would [do away with the entire AP program](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/ap-classes-are-a-scam/263456/).   Obviously, there are too many deeply entrenched interests for this to happen, but one thing that can be done for AP Stat is to switch its computational vehicle to R.

As noted, R is free and is multi platform, with outstanding graphical capabilities.  There is no end to the number of data sets teenagers would find attractive for R use, say the [Million Song Data Set.](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/)

As to a textbook, there are many introductions to Statistics that use R, such as Michael Crawley’s *Statistics: an Introduction Using R,* and Peter Dalgaard’s *Introductory Statistics Using R*.  But to really do it right, I would suggest that a group of Stat professors collaboratively write an open-source text, as [has been done for instance for Chemistry.](http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/)  Examples of interest to high schoolers should be used, say this [engaging analysis on OK Cupid](http://blog.okcupid.com/).

This is not a complete solution by any means.  There still is the issue of AP Stat being taught by people who lack depth in the field, and so on.  And even switching to R would meet with resistance from various interests, such as the College Board and especially the AP Stat teachers themselves.

But given all these weighty problems, it certainly would be nice to do *something*, right?  Switching to R would be doable–and should be done.",154,55,Bayequentist,2021-04-25 21:56:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/myinjq/d_7_years_since_norm_matloffs_blog_post/,0,statistics
m00voj,[C] Forced to p-hack/hide negative results at work,"Hi everyone, 

I made a similar posting in r/datascience a while back and got some helpful input, but wondering if I can get any additional insights from other statisticians. 

I’ve been working as a data scientist for a little under a year now, but my education is in statistics and I consider myself more of a statistician that happens to be in data science. 

Recently at work, I’m being asked to p-hack and find ways to explain away findings that don’t support the bottom line. I’m even being asked to outright change certain numbers so that our readings become significant. My motivation to get into this field was to fight against the misuse of statistics, so I’m having a bit of an existential crisis because of this. 

I’ve tried educating my colleagues/boss on the dangers of p-hacking and have even suggested additional metrics that can be included alongside significance testing (such as effect size, etc.), but I’m not being heard. Worse, my boss seems to understand and believe me, but when we are meetings with executives, goes silent and doesn’t stand behind me as I try to explain everything and do the right thing. 

I’m the only person at my company with classical statistics training and am the newest member. I am just trying to do right and protect my team from reporting out false/inflated values. 

I’m at a bit of a loss and don’t know how to best move forward. On one hand, I’m being pushed to do the additional analyses and to stand up for what is right, but when it counts, I’m being left to fend for myself. 

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Have you been able to successfully navigate this or were you forced to leave? Also, not sure if this is relevant, but I am the only woman of color on my team. Maybe that’s playing into things? But I hate to jump to conclusions. 

Any advice/shared experience would be enormously helpful!

EDIT: Going through the responses as quickly as I can! Thank you so much for all of the responses/support. I feel reassured that this isn’t how it is everywhere and now I’m armed with a couple of ideas I can try out (thanks to your help) until I’m in a better position to hop ship.",154,65,Passacagalia,2021-03-07 22:05:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/m00voj/c_forced_to_phackhide_negative_results_at_work/,0,statistics
gms5bk,[Q] Recommendations on concise (<20 pages) summaries of major statistical topics?,"I am a graduate-level (MS) statistician and old geezer that's worked in industry for many years. I am putting together a binder with high-level summaries of various statistical topics to reference when needed. These can be lecture notes, PowerPoint slides, articles, peer-reviewed publications, blog posts, etc. that are concise (<20 pages) and provide an excellent overview of the material.

For example, consider the Survival Analysis four-part tutorial paper by Clark, Bradburn, Love, Altman 2003. (WARNING: PDF files ahead: [Part I](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2394262/pdf/89-6601118a.pdf), [Part II](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2394368/pdf/89-6601119a.pdf), [Part III](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2376927/pdf/89-6601120a.pdf), [Part IV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2394469/pdf/89-6601117a.pdf)). I have this paper printed, annotated, highlighted, and tucked away in a binder to use as my go-to reference for Survival Analysis. Here is what I like about this source:

* **Concise**: The main content comprises <20 pages altogether.
* **Accessible**: The language is easy to follow.
* **Context**: Provides good background on the type of problems you would use Survival Analysis for. It explains *when* and *why* you would use Survival Analysis.
* **Theory**: Provides a review of the underlying theory including the mathematics.
* **Application**: Examples are provided of the technique applied to real data. An interpretation of results is provided when a model is used.

I am hoping to find similar material on any statistical topic. An example list provided below. I acknowledge that many of these topics are easy or have overlap. These are just provided as suggested topics: other statistical areas are welcome.

* Categorical Data Analysis
* Propensity Scores
* Multilevel/Nested Models, Random Effects, Fixed Effects
* Survey stats
* PCA/Factor Analysis
* ""Fundamental"" stats (e.g., hypothesis testing, inference, CLT, sampling distributions, etc.)
* Regression techniques (Poisson, Logistic, Negative Binomial, simple linear regression, etc.)
* Experimental design/clinical trials methodology/epidemiology
* GLM diagnostics, troubleshooting, model fitting
* Time Series
* Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)

I know this is hoping for a lot. I am grateful for any recommendations.

ri7nmv,[Discussion] Do undergrads really understand statistical inference?," 

I posted this on an econometrics subreddit, but I want to also ask the more general statistics community. I hope that's okay! Note, I'm not an instructor, but starting my Ph.D. soon it hopes of teaching econometrics!

For Students: When you took your first statistical inference course, did you REALLY understand statistical inference by end of the course?

And for professors: Did you think the average student truly understands statistical inference?

By ""really"" and ""truly"", I'm not talking about being able to robotically calculate statistics: t-stat, p-value, CI and knowing when to reject and fail to reject the null... the stuff that gets you an A+ in Stats 101 if you can repeat them on the test. I got an A+ in intro statistics because we had past finals/midterms and I just ""memorized"" how to do it on the exam. The exam was literally the same as a practice midterm just different numbers/scenarios. 

I'm talking about the bigger picture of statistical inference. If you asked your average introductory statistics student (or even just the A+ students) the more philosophical and epistemological questions, would they be able to give a confident answer?

1. Describe the big picture of statistical inference, what is it, what is it trying to do?
2. What does it mean that the sample estimate has a distribution? What does it mean that estimator is a random variable itself? Why is this a problem?
3. What is a hypothesis test doing? Why are you undertaking it? Why do people do it? What information does it give you that you didn't know before? What does it mean that you're assuming something to be true? What does it mean about your assumption when you reject/fail-to-reject the null?
4. What does it mean that you do not know the parameter and can never truly know what it is? How does affect your ability to understand how some random process works?

In my experience, I feel like most students get lost in learning the methods of calculations, they neglect to appreciate the bigger picture. It's like a student getting an A+ in Calculus because they can apply all the derivative rules perfectly but somehow never really understood that a derivative is the rate of change.  

Most of the stuff intro stats students are evaluated on are things a computer can do for them. They are neglected or not truly tested to understand the epistemological value of knowing how statistical inference works.",151,88,None,2021-12-17 03:16:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/ri7nmv/discussion_do_undergrads_really_understand/,0,statistics

3ow1cd,"My stats professor just went on a rant about how R-squared values are essentially useless, is there any truth to this?","So my stats professor just told my upper-level stats class that the use of R-squared values is one of the biggest mistakes made in statistics today.  Here are some of his reasons for while we shouldn't use it.  

1.) It does not measure goodness of fit because it can be arbitrarily low even when the model is correct, and close to 1 even when the model is wrong.

2.) It is also a pretty useless measure of predictability because it says nothing about prediction error and nothing about interval forecasts.

3.) It cannot be compared across datasets.

4.) It cannot be compared across untransformed and transformed models.

He has a few more reasons but they are in our notes and pretty long.  I'm just been taught my entire life about R-squared and now he seems to be going in the complete opposite direction.  I may be misinterpreting what he's saying about it, but I'm just curious if what he is saying is true?  If you need more details on his reasoning I can show you the source where it comes from.

aav43e,"Degrees of Freedom, Explained","(blog mirror: https://www.stats-et-al.com/2018/12/degrees-of-freedom-explained.html )

You can interpret degrees of freedom, or DF as the number of (new) pieces of information that go into a statistic. Using examples from this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rATNoxKg1yA , James Gilbert, “What are degrees of freedom”]

I personally prefer to think of DF as a kind of statistical currency. You earn it by taking independent sample units, and you spend it on estimating population parameters or on information required to get compute test statistics.

In this article, degrees of freedom are explained through these lenses through some common hypothesis tests, with some selected topics like saturation, fractional DF, and mixed effect models at the end.


## Spending DF, T-Tests

Taking the mean and standard deviation from a sample of size N from a single population, we start with N DF, and 'spend' 1 of them on estimating the mean, which is necessary for calculating the standard deviation.

S = sqrt( sum(x – x-bar)^2 / (N-1))

The remaining N-1 can be 'spent' on estimating the standard deviation.

In a two sample t-test setting, you need to estimate the difference (or, more generally, a contrast), between the means of two different populations. This test uses samples of size N1 and N2 from these two populations respectively. That implies that you have N1 + N2 degrees of freedom, and that you spend 2 of them estimating the 2 means. The remaining N1 + N2 - 2 can be used on estimating the uncertainty. How that N1 + N2 - 2 is spent depends on your assumptions about the variance. If you assume that both groups have the same variance, then you can spend all (N1 + N2 - 2) DF on estimating that one ‘pooled’ variance.

If you do not assume equal variance between the two populations, you need spend (N1 - 1) of the DF on estimating the standard deviation of population 1, and (N2 - 1) on estimating the standard deviation of population 2. We’re still estimating a single contrast between the population means, and we need to apply a single t-distribution to the contrast.

How much we know about the standard deviation of this contrast depends on how much information we have about each of the two standard deviations. If we don't have a computer on hand, we can rely on the worst-case scenario, which is that we know only as much as what we know about the smallest of the two samples, that is min(N1 - 1, N2 - 1) DF. More commonly, we calculate a 'DF equivalent' based on how close the two variance estimates are. The closer the estimates are, the closer to the ideal (N1 + N2 - 2) DF we assume that we have.

## Spending DF, ANOVA

In a One-Way ANOVA setting for k means. we have samples of size N1, N2, ... , Nk from each of k populations, respectively. That implies that we have (N1 + N2 + ... Nk) DF to work with. Let's call that N DF for simplicity.

A One-Way ANOVA is a comparison of the group means to the grand mean (mean of ALL observations). So we need 1 DF for the grand mean, and (k-1) DF for the k group means. Why k-1? Because the last group mean can be estimated from the other groups and the grand mean. In other words, we get it 'for free'. These (k-1) DF are spent on measuring the standard deviation BETWEEN the groups.

That leaves (N-k) DF for estimating the standard deviation WITHIN each group. Note that ANOVA requires the assumption that all the groups have equal variance, such that we use all the remaining degrees of freedom to estimate that collective standard deviation.

## Spending DF, Regression

In a simple linear regression setting, we have N independent observations, and each observation has two values in an (x,y) pair. We need to estimate the slope and the intercept, so that's 1 DF each, or 2 DF total. That leaves (N-2) DF for estimating the uncertainty.

With linear regression, we also have a nice geometric interpretation of DF. A line can always be fit through two points. If we have N points, then we use 2 of them to fit a line, and the remaining N-2 points represent random noise.

With multiple regression, we have p ‘slope’ parameters and a sample of N. In this case, we start with N DF, spend 1 DF on the intercept, and p DF on the slopes, leaving us with (N - p - 1) DF to estimate uncertainty.

## Spending DF, Chi-Squared Tests

With t-tests, ANOVA, and regression, we are essentially finding the degrees of freedom to use as a parameter in one or two t-distributions. Also, the observed responses (y variables) in these cases are composed of continuous, numeric values. When the responses are categorical, the situation is radically different.

There are two commonly used tests conducted on categorical variables using the chi-squared statistic: Goodness-of-fit tests and independence tests, also called one-way and two-way chi-squared tests, respectively. Both of these tests are calculated by finding the expected number of responses for each category, and comparing them to the observed responses:

Chi-squared = sum( O – E)^2 / E

For the one-way / goodness-of-fit test, we have one categorical variable of C categories. The total of the observed counts O and the expected counts E both need to add up to the sample total of observations N. We need the total N in order to find the expected counts E, just like how we need the mean x-bar in order to find the sample standard deviation s in the numerical case.

As such, once you have the total and O and E for the first C-1 categories, you automatically have it for the last category. Analogously to the standard deviation situation, this means we have C-1 degrees of freedom in a one-way chi-squared test.

We have C categories with numbers in them, but we need to spend 1 DF on finding the total, leaving (C – 1) DF for estimating uncertainty.

For the two-way / independence test, we have two categorical variables of C ‘column’ and R ‘row’ categories each respectively. That implies that there are C*R combinations of categories. The expected counts for each combination, or cell, are computed from the R row totals and the C column totals. There is a bit of redundancy, so that’s actually R + C – 1 independent pieces of information.

We have C*R cells of information, but for doing a test of independence, we need R + C – 1 pieces of information from the row and column totals. That leaves (C*R – R – C – 1) or (C-1)*(R-1) degrees of freedom to spend on uncertainty quantification.

## Fractional Degrees of Freedom

One particular thorny notion about equivalent degrees of freedom is that we can end up working with a number of degrees of freedom that are not whole numbers. Given that each independent data point yields 1 DF, that's a little bizarre.

First, we calculate equivalent degrees of freedom, sometimes we're using it to calculate something that is a composite of two or more measures. The contrast (e.g. difference) between the two means in the two sample t-test, for example, involves calculating two different standard deviations, so we're already straying from that idea of 'the amount of information going into a single estimate'.

Second, that word INDEPENDENT is a big one. If we have 10 completely independent observations, then we have a sample of size N=10. But, if those observations are correlated in some way (e.g. in a time series, like the day-to-day average temperature), then each new recorded number isn't giving as much information as a completely independent observation. In cases like this, we sometimes calculate an 'effective sample size', which would be somewhere between 1 and N, depending on how correlated the observations were. That effective sample size doesn't have to be a whole number, so neither do the degrees of freedom calculations that are derived from it. (For more on effective sample size, see psuedoreplication).

Thirdly, mathematically, there often isn't a problem with using a non-whole number of degrees of freedom. Both the t-distribution and the chi-squared distribution work just as well with DF = 3.5 as it does with DF =3 or DF = 4.

## Saturation, DF Bankruptcy

If we ever have 0 DF left over after estimating all the means, slope parameters, or another other parameters, then we have what's called a saturated model. In chemistry, a saturated solution is one that is holding all the dissolved material that it can. A saturated model is one that is estimating all the parameters that it can. There is nothing left to measure uncertainty in those estimates.

For a saturated ANOVA, we can estimate each of the group means, but we have no way of knowing how good those estimates are. For a saturated regression, we can get the intercept and the slope, but we have no way of knowing how uncertain we should be about those estimates.

In a saturated model, things like confidence intervals, standard errors, and p-values are impossible to obtain.

One common solution to saturation is to impose additional assumptions or restrictions on the model. In an ANOVA, we might use a fractional factorial model and not bother to estimate certain high-level interactions. In a regression, we might treat a set of group effects as random effects, and not consider them when trying to fit the line of best fit.

In the fractional factorial case mentioned in ANOVA, this is for multi-way ANOVAs, but one-way ANOVAs, and the solution is to simply assume that some higher-order interactions are zero. If you assume they are zero, you don't need to estimate them.

The LASSO, a regression-like method that can handle situations where the number of possible parameters p is greater than the sample size N, works on a similar principle: it assumes that most of those possible parameters are zero, thus saving the degrees of freedom necessary to estimate them.

## Mixed-Effects and REML

For the regression case without random effects, the slopes are traditionally estimated using a method based on maximum likelihood or ML. In lay-terms, ML is ""given then data that we observe, what are the parameter values that would have the highest chance of producing data like this"".

When we introduce random effects, REML is used instead, which is short for Restricted Estimation of Maximum Likelihood. In this case, we only estimate the non-random effects (that is, the fixed effects, the ones we actually care about) using maximum likelihood, and then assign the random effects as after-the-fact adjustments to our predictions. By not using the random effects in fitting the model, we don't need to spend any degrees of freedom to estimate them, and we can save those degrees of freedom for estimating uncertainty instead. Thus either preventing saturation, or giving better confidence intervals, standard errors, and p-values. The trade-off is that we still have no uncertainty measures for the random effects, but that's an acceptable issue in many cases.

orzy0d,[C] Graduated with statistics degree; can’t find a job to save my life.,"I just graduated with a statistics degree, and am looking for a data scientist/statistical programmer/analyst type job. However, my GPA was low; clocked in at a 2.9 (thanks ADHD) and COVID hit at the end of my junior year and wiped out my internship plans. I’ve been seriously struggling to figure out what to do next. I’ve been getting sparse interviews, but no offers and I rarely make it past the first round. 

I have my SAS Base certification as well as experience with macros, PROC IML and PROC REG/ARIMA which I’ve heard is great, but most SAS programmer jobs require multiple years of experience and/or a master’s degree. I also have experience in R, SQL, and Python. However, I have no experience in the field, the best I’ve got is a few months of being a supervisor at a grocery store. 

Am I screwed because of the bad entry level market? How should I go about starting my career?

kkseds,[E] A short quiz on some Machine Learning fundamentals,"I've made a [short quiz ](https://nds.show/machine-learning-quiz/)that goes over some of the more fundamental concepts and widely used methods in Machine Learning (not specific frameworks or libraries). Would be awesome if you could give me some feedback on this first version. By posting here, I am specially interested in finding out how those in the statistics community with interest  in ML find this work.

Given how vast ML is, this quiz, with 20 questions, is not comprehensive in anyway, more like selected topics. But the hope is that the questions could give some inspiration and pointers to some of the more important topics and areas in ML, trigger some thought, or at least be a nice refresher for those topics. In the long run, I hope to make more of this type of quiz, if they're helpful for improving ML education.

Would really appreciate if you could give it a try and let me know what you think about it, if you have suggestions for improvement, other areas you'd like to see questions on, and also if you found mistakes in there (more like where you find them ;) ).

vgsypc,[Career] Why is SAS still pervasive in industry?," I have training in physics and maths and have been looking at statistical programming jobs in the private sector (mostly biotech), and it seems like every single company wants to use SAS.

It's extortionate, syntactically awful, closed-source, has terrible docs, and lags a LOT of functionality behind modern statistical packages implemented in Python and R.

A lot of the statistical programming work sounds interesting *except* that it's in SAS, and I just cannot fathom why anybody would keep using this garbage instead of R + Tableau or something.

ug6c22,[Discussion] Statistical test of my wife's garlic snobbery,"My wife and I usually prep our steaks with a simple rub of salt, pepper, and either fresh garlic or garlic powder, depending on which one of us is getting them ready. My wife insists that there's a difference and that only fresh garlic should be used. I'm skeptical that she would be able to taste the difference, so I use garlic powder to save time. Today, we're putting her garlic snobbery to the test and I'd like your input on my experimental design.

Experiment:

* 2 New York Strips prepared identically except for the garlic; one has fresh, one has garlic powder.
* My wife will eat 7 pieces of steak blindfolded, 3 from one stake and 4 from the other (I won't tell her how many of each, only that there is at least 1 of each.)
* I'll randomize the order of the steak pieces using a random number generator in Excel.
* If she gets 6 of the 7 correct, the probability of such an extreme observation (p-value) is 6.25%, which is probably enough for me to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that she can taste the difference.

jtu0fj,[question] I'm a third year psych PhD student with a good background in math and a dark secret. I don't know how to fit or interpret those fancy linear models with fixed and random effects. I don't know what a random slope is. Where do I learn this stuff?,"I'm a psychology PhD student, and so far I've taken calculus, probability theory, and a fairly advanced machine learning class, where we covered a broad number of models with a good amount of depth (including generalized linear models). My point is, I am quite comfortable with theory and math. I am also comfortable with coding (I know R, Python and MATLAB).

Unfortunately, I had a terrible teacher for the only two advanced stats classes I've taken: the focus was to cover as many models and tests as possible, and to learn how to carry them out with paper and pencil, with very little attention to what exactly the tests tested for. My theoretical and practical knowledge of statistical inference is quite poor. I thought I would eventually find a source that will teach me everything I needed to know about statistical inference in an experiment design context, but I haven't found one yet, and it's getting embarrassing since I am in my third year now. When I read anything about fixed vs random effects, or random slopes in the context of a psych paper, my eyes glaze over.

This Christmas break, I want to get back on track. Where do I learn this stuff? For calculus, there are calc books (e.g., Thomas, Weir, Hass); for probability theory, there are prob theory textbooks (e.g., Grinstead and Snell), for machine learning there are many excellent comprehensive texts (e.g., Christopher Bishop's *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*). Why haven't I been able to find a comprehensive textbook on modern statistical methods for experimental design? The texts I find are usually too old and don't include modern methods (they stop at ANOVAs); the ones that are new enough to cover them do so in a very superficial manner. Are there good books directly about this topic that I simply haven't been able to find?

m7gtsy,"[D] Textbooks shouldn't define ""sample variance"" as the unbiased estimator of the population variance","Hot take: textbooks should define ""sample variance"" as \\sum{x\_i  - \\bar{x}}/n, not \\sum{x\_i  - \\bar{x}}/(n - 1).

The rationale for choosing the latter is that \\sum{x\_i  - \\bar{x}}/(n - 1) is an unbiased estimator of the population variance; that is, its expected value is the population variance. There are many problems with this:

\- Introductory textbooks talk about ""sample variance"" way before they explain what an estimator even is. The ""sample variance"" is not introduced as an estimator, but as a *descriptive statistic*, a way of *summarizing* your current data (this is typically done in a chapter that introduces histograms, quantiles, the sample mean, etc). If that's the goal, then the ""biased variance"" is just fine. Mean absolute deviation would be even better. But what happens is that students end up searching ""why we divide by n -1 in the sample variance????"", only to hear confusing explanations about degrees of freedom, bias, etc. ""Ok, I kinda understand this, I guess... But I just wanted to summarize my sample, why we're suddenly talking about a possibly hypothetical and unobservable ""superpopulation"" that somehow ""generates"" our data, averages of infinite samples, etc?""

\- Defining ""sample variance"" as the unbiased estimator gives the illusion that unbiasedness is a virtue. But it's not: the ""best"" estimator is a matter of your risk (if frequentist) or loss (if Bayesian) function. Suppose you want to minimize the mean squared error of the estimator instead of the bias (a very reasonable goal: it often makes more sense to minimize the MSE than to minimize the bias). \\sum{x\_i  - \\bar{x}}/(n - 1) is often not the optimal estimator under the criterion, [you have to increase the bias to find the minimum MSE estimator](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2860289/minimum-mean-squared-error-of-an-estimator-of-the-variance-of-the-normal-distrib). Why teach the unbiased estimator as the default?

\- I understand that many statistical methods rely on the unbiased estimator of the population variance. But that's not a good justification for the definition. Textbooks should use the term ""unbiased estimator of the variance"" instead and only introduce the concept when they're actually talking about estimation, usually alongside MLE, method of moments, etc. (EDIT: Some people complain that using ""s\^2"" for the population variance would be confusing, because you'd have to add many correction factors later on. You don't have to. Keep using s for the estimator, use something else for the descriptive statistic). ""Bias"" is another misleading term and it would be even better if we abandoned it altogether. ""The component of error orthogonal to the variance"" (to use Jaynes's suggestion) is not as loaded.

\- One objection to my proposal might be that the numerical difference between dividing by n and dividing by (n - 1) is very small. Considering the other points I've made, that's actually another reason to \*not\* divide by (n  - 1)!

&#x200B;

EDIT: Here's a weaker claim. If you wanna present the (n -1) definition to students who don't even know what an estimator is, fine. But it's probably a good idea to emphasize that there's \*nothing wrong\* with the n-denominator definition if your goal is to just describe the dispersion of your sample. Sometimes that's all that matters. We use the (n - 1) definition for inference purposes, although that's also not absolutely optimal in every scenario.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: Here's another argument. ""Sample standard deviation"" is defined as the square root of the (n-1) sample variance. But the sample standard deviation is not an unbiased estimator of the population standard deviation (Jensen's inequality)! And many times, what we do care about is the standard deviation of the population, not the variance. But nobody cares about this bias (good)",138,41,paplike,2021-03-18 02:17:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/m7gtsy/d_textbooks_shouldnt_define_sample_variance_as/,0,statistics

l6msn5,[C] Statisticians that don't use statistics,"I find myself in an undesirable situation that I suspect others have encountered as well. 

I recently graduated with my MS in Statistics and took a job titled ""Statistician"" in the financial services industry. I work under PhD/MS statisticians and economists and, based on my interviews, I was expecting to do typical statistical consultant type work - lots of data processing but also leading studies based in statistics, building financial time series models, maybe even some R&D. In fact, that was really appealing to me because I wanted to get more technical experience beyond my MS. 

However, I now realize that at best I was naive and at worst it was a bait and switch. I have done little to no statistics since I started here. I spend most of my days doing data processing of varying difficulty or writing up documents on how to process data for other groups at the company. When I tell my manager that I'd like to be doing more statistics, he agrees with me, but always pushes the issue down the road. In fact, my company as a whole doesn't really do much statistical analysis at all despite having around 50 PhD/MS economists and statisticians. 

My question is this, how soon do I need to get out? I recently interviewed for another role and was amazed at how much statistics I have already forgotten.

7crzws,I 'played' Snakes 'n Ladders 10 million times. Here's the results.,"After playing Snakes 'n Ladders with my kids I became curious about the number of turns it could take to complete in the best and worst case scenarios. I posted here just in case anyone else is curious.

I wrote a python script to play the game as a single player and count how many turns it took to complete. I had it play 10 million times (which took 36 minutes, btw) and recorded the data for a [histogram](https://imgur.com/VCdi0Hx) as well as the results below.

    completed game 10000000 times
    max turns: 862
    min turns: 7
    average turns: 59.3
    median turns: 46
    mode turns: 24
    Run time: 2138.358 seconds

One curious result I noticed was that there were zero occurrences for both 129 and 251 turns. ~~Perhaps it just works out that these are impossible to attain with the particular snake/ladder configuration.~~ [Detail here](https://imgur.com/5KKtq1V) 

The board configuration I used for my code was [this one](http://codepumpkin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SnakeNLadder.jpg).

EDIT: 
My code is here:
https://pastebin.com/fy3tYB5t
perhaps someone can find a bug that caused my 'gaps'.
The rules I used were: No extra turns on a 6 roll. No bounce-back at 100, need exactly 100 to win, otherwise the turn is skipped.

EDIT 2:
It looks like my gap issue was just due to how I plotted my histogram. I set my number of bins to the max number of turns. But, many turn quantities were skipped, causing them to get out of sync with the bins. And, or most importantly, my first value is 7, not 0/1, so that probably plays a part.

8de54s,Is R better than Python at anything?

I've done some research on data science and apparently Python seems to be growing faster in the industry and in academia alike.

Does Python match that? Will my R knowledge help me pick up Python faster?

Does it make sense to keep up with both?

v0ia3p,[D] Statistical Rethinking and the job market,"Statistical Rethinking is by far my favorite stats textbook, applicable to beginners and experts alike, really explores the pros of Bayesian analysis. 

I’m finding that while these skills are fun to master, it’s insanely hard finding roles that are explicitly looking for the skill set and just as hard persuading your current org to green light projects using such a design.

Stakeholders often don’t know what can and can’t be asked of statistics, so you get lots of surface level inquiries like “did we move the mean of X this year?” 

A mixed effects GLM where you compare relationships between variables across segments is super interesting…but your stakeholders don’t know that this even exists and so they weigh you down with work less prone to uncovering key patterns below the surface.

hax94c,[D] The fact that people rely on p-values so much shows that they do not understand p-values,"Hey everyone,   
First off, I'm not a statistician but come from a social science / economics background. Still, I'd say I had some reasonable amount of statistics classes and understand the basics fairly well. Recently, one lecturer explained p-values as ""the probability you are in error when rejecting h0"" which sounded strange and plain wrong to me. I started arguing with her but realized that I didn't fully understand what a p-value is myself. So, I ended up reading some papers about it and now think I at least somewhat understand what a p-value actually is and how much ""certainty"" it can actually provide you with. What I came to think now is, for practical purposes, it does not provide you with any certainty close enough to make a reasonable conclusion based on whether you get a significant result or not. Still, also on this subreddit, probably one out of five questions is primarily concerned with statistical significance.    
Now, to my actual point, it seems to me that most of these people just do not understand what a p-value actually is. To be clear, I do not want to judge anyone here, nobody taught me about all these complications in any of my stats or research method classes either. I just wonder whether I might be too strict and meticulous after having read so much about the limitations of p-values.   
These are the papers I think helped me the most with my understanding.

12arj39,Why don’t we always bootstrap? [Q],"
I’m taking a computational statistics class and we are learning a wide variety of statistical computing tools for inference, involving Monte Carlo methods, bootstrap methods, jackknife, and general Monte Carlo inference. 

If it’s one thing I’ve learned is how powerful the bootstrap is. In the book I saw an example of bootstrapping regression coefficients. In general, I’ve noticed that bootstrapping can provide a very powerful tool for understanding more about parameters we wish to estimate. Furthermore, after doing some researching I saw the connections between the bootstrapped distribution of your statistic and how it can resembles a “poor man’s posterior distribution” as Jerome Friedman put it. 

After looking at the regression example I thought, why don’t we always bootstrap? You can call lm() once and you get a estimate for your coefficient. Why wouldn’t you want to bootstrap them and get a whole distribution? 

I guess my question is why don’t more things in stats just get bootstrapped in practice? For computational reasons sure maybe we don’t need to run 10k simulations to find least squares estimates. But isn’t it helped up to see a distribution of our slope coefficients rather than just one realization? 

Another question I have is what are some limitations to the bootstrap? I’ve been kinda of in awe of it and I feel it is the most overpowered tool and thus I’ve now just been bootstrapping everything. How much can I trust the distribution I get after bootstrapping?",122,73,Direct-Touch469,2023-04-03 17:34:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/12arj39/why_dont_we_always_bootstrap_q/,0,statistics

9egem6,you can't fix bad psych methods with bad ML methods: comments on a recent paper,"**TL;DR:** new psychology study claims to use ML methods on MTurk sample as antidote to non-replicability of psych studies, but there are questionable analysis choices (such as dropping 15% of the data and discretizing their continuous outcome variable into 10 unordered classes), the result they get is a variable importance ranking of attributes driving predictive model fit, which they overinterpret and don't acknowledge a much more obvious driver of their finding. Read on if you want to hear more and discuss.

---

I learned about the recent paper [""Good Things for Those Who Wait: Predictive Modeling Highlights Importance of Delay Discounting for Income Attainment""](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01545/full) from the Marginal Revolution blog's Friday link round-up. It's an easy open-access read and I encourage you all to give it a skim. I have a lot of concerns about the methodology and interpretation in this paper and want to discuss this here. (Yes, it's a day ending in 'y', so of course there is a questionable social science study out in a high-impact journal which has garnered [a fair amount of media coverage](http://loop-impact.frontiersin.org/impact/article/359023#socialbuzz) and [over 13K views.](http://loop-impact.frontiersin.org/impact/article/359023#totalviews/views))

The authors tout their machine learning approach to data analysis as superior to traditional methods one might use instead. They motivate their work with concerns about multicollinearity that we experience with ""standard correlational and regression analytic approaches"". While that's fair, I am worried that psychology researchers may take away bad advice from this study when making good-faith efforts to address their field's very well-known issues around replication, which the authors specifically mention as motivating their approach to data collection and analysis.

This also provides an anecdote supporting a trend I've noticed: because of ML hype, there are an increasing number of data analysts who have learned about topics like cross-validation and random forests without having adequate statistical training to ground them. The authors write things like, ""we were able to model continuous, categorical, and dichotomous variables simultaneously, and subsequently compare their relative importance for predicting income; this would not have been possible using more traditional methods."" I don't know what strawman they have in mind, but there's nothing groundbreaking about modeling continuous and categorical features simultaneously. Additionally, I see lots of ""garden of forking paths"" analysis choices that would hinder replication, as many decisions are made on the whole data before the training/test splits, which makes the whole holdout/CV aspect of the paper seem like a lot of show for nothing.

The topic is ""a simple yet essential question: why do some individuals make more money than others?"" They cite prior work around some sociodemographic factors as well as height and the infamous Marshmallow Test around delay discounting (which I should note [has not held up well](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/marshmallow-test/561779/) in recent replications, which they do not cite). It's not totally clear what the authors' scientific questions or hypotheses are, but they seem to think it is interesting to figure out which of the basic sociodemographic and discount delay behavioral attributes they survey MTurkers about are most predictive of income and rank them.

Here's the setup:

* **Data collection:** the study's data come from an Amazon MTurk sample of 3000 Americans aged 25-65 who answered some questions about delayed gratification indifference points. Like: would you rather have $500 now or $1000 in 6 months? If you said $500 now, then would you rather have $250 now or $1000 in 6 months? If you said $1000 in 6 months, then would you rather have $375 now or $1000 in 6 months? etc. splitting the boundaries iterating until you have no preference. The indifference tasks were answered for time frames of 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year (variables of primary interest). The MTurkers also answered questions about income (the dependent outcome of interest), age, sex, race, ethnicity, height, education level, zip code, and occupational group.

* **Data cleaning:** the authors perform aggressive ""outlier"" handling that removes 15% of their data, resulting in n=2564 respondents for analysis. They drop all students and any participant who completed the delay discounting questions in under 2 SDs below the mean task time. The fast-completion removal rule is a red flag because subjects who chose the ""$1000 in the future"" option at the outset would have finished the task much faster than others, and so *the dropped outliers procedure is likely strongly associated with the delay discounting responses* and would bias the data. The authors also say they applied ""extreme value detection and distribution-based inspections"" to other continuous covariates without clarifying further. To me, these look like forking path decisions that may substantially affect the results, and all of this is done before holding out data.

* **Outcome discretization:** This part is the biggest eyebrow raiser: they take the continuous self-reported income outcome variable (ranges from $10K to $235K) and discretize it into 10 buckets containing the same number of (non-outlier) subjects. This converts their analysis into a 10-level classification task with performance measured by AUC. In discretizing, these income groups become *unordered* labels and thus the authors get much less information out of their data than if they handled this as a regression problem by leaving income as a numeric variable. They claim: ""This conversion also yielded a more compact representation, and thus, less complexity"", to which I say *absolutely NOT.* The loss functions for their ML models treat mis-classifying someone who actually makes $23K a year in the $24.5K-$35.2K group equally as erroneously as mis-classifying them in the $158.4K-$235K group! This transformation is not only statistically wasteful, it leaves their models uninterpretable as a side effect: they can't describe the direction of the relationship between discounting and income or speak to model fit in an understandable way (like RMSE). It's likely that their predictive models would not be robust to different choices for number of outcome levels or cut points.

* **Model fitting:** They messed with income because they are motivated by trying to cram the data into a particular ML framework without being aware of the trade-offs. The authors justify this with: ""Some of the criteria that we used in our feature selection method are more compatible with categorical features. Further, reported incomes were not evenly distributed."" This is the method driving the transformation at the expense of the science and they do not say *why* unevenly distributed incomes would be an issue (hint: they aren't). They run SVMs, neural networks, and random forests on a 90% subset of the data with 10-fold CV, and as part of this process, they calculate feature importance by removing variables one-by-one to rank their contribution in predicting the income labels.

* **Results:** The primary output is [a ranking of which variables they considered in terms of feature importance,](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/359023/fpsyg-09-01545-HTML/image_m/fpsyg-09-01545-t002.jpg) and the underwhelming conclusion: ""Interestingly, delay discounting was more predictive than age, race, ethnicity, and height"" (but that's just 1 year delay discounting, and occupation, education, zip code, and gender are more important). Instead of reporting effect sizes or showing a marginal GAM plot, they have just moved the target to something more stable (importance ranks) but less interesting. To me, this isn't a solution to multicollinearity or non-linearity, it's just replacing a thing we care about with something much less useful. They can't even speak to *how* delayed discounting predicts income to assess whether the models even make scientific sense. For all we know from these results, preferring $1000 in the future over $X now could be *negatively* associated with income after accounting for other attributes.

* **Causality:** They make a brief disclaimer that results are associational and not causal, but they don't mention what seems to me like a simple and obvious explanation for their finding that delayed discounting helps predict income, which is that *income causes delayed discounting* rather than *delayed discounting causes income.* The authors write: ""we speculate that this relationship [aside: whose sign they haven't established!] may be a consequence of the correlation between higher discounting and other undesirable life choices. ... In this way, one possibility is that delay discounting signals a cascade of negative behaviors that derail individuals from pursuing education and may ultimately preclude entry into certain lucrative occupational niches."" I'm no psychologist, but it seems really obvious that someone who makes $20K probably *is* more likely to prefer an immediate windfall of $500 compared to someone who makes $150K who can afford to wait a year to see the full $1000...because they're poor and $500 now may go far in paying for today's expenses.",122,23,normee,2018-09-09 20:53:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/9egem6/you_cant_fix_bad_psych_methods_with_bad_ml/,0,statistics

16j09dt,What's the harm in teaching p-values wrong? [D],"In my machine learning class (in the computer science department) my professor said that a p-value of  .05 would mean you can be 95% confident in rejecting the null. Having taken some stats classes and knowing this is wrong, I brought this up to him after class. He acknowledged that my definition (that a p-value is the probability of seeing a difference this big or bigger assuming the null to be true) was correct. However, he justified his explanation by saying that in practice his explanation was more useful.

Given that this was a computer science class and not a stats class I see where he was coming from. He also prefaced this part of the lecture by acknowledging that we should challenge him on stats stuff if he got any of it wrong as its been a long time since he took a stats class.

Instinctively, I don't like the idea of teaching something wrong. I'm familiar with the concept of a [lie-to-children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie-to-children) and think it can be a valid and useful way of teaching things. However, I would have preferred if my professor had been more upfront about how he was over simplifying things.

That being said, I couldn't think of any strong reasons about why lying about this would cause harm. The subtlety of what a p-value actually represents seems somewhat technical and not necessarily useful to  a computer scientist or non-statistician.

So, is there any harm in believing that a p-value tells you directly how confident you can be in your results? Are there any particular situations where this might cause someone to do science wrong or say draw the wrong conclusion about whether a given machine learning model is better than another?

&#x200B;

Edit:

I feel like some responses aren't totally responding to what I asked (or at least what I intended to ask). I know that this interpretation of p-values is completely wrong. But *what* harm does it cause?

Say you're only concerned about deciding which of two models is better. You've run some tests and model 1 does better than model 2. The p-value is low so you conclude that model 1 is indeed better than model 2.

It doesn't really matter too much to you what exactly a p-value represents. You've been told that a low p-value means that you can trust that your results probably weren't due to random chance.

Is there a scenario where interpreting the p-value correctly would result in not being able to conclude that model 1 was the best?",118,173,TiloRC,2023-09-15 01:41:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/16j09dt/whats_the_harm_in_teaching_pvalues_wrong_d/,0,statistics

nmj3na,[Question] What analogies have helped you understand statistical concepts?,"I was confused about multilevel/hierarchical modeling until I read the following analogy in Statistical Rethinking: 

"" Suppose we program a robot to visit two cafés, order coffee, and  
estimate the waiting times at each. The robot begins with a vague prior for the waiting times,  
say with a mean of 5 minutes and a standard deviation of 1. After ordering a cup of coffee  
at the first café, the robot observes a waiting time of 4 minutes. It updates its prior, using  
Bayes’ theorem of course, with this information. This gives it a posterior distribution for the  
waiting time at the first café.  
Now the robot moves on to a second café. When this robot arrives at the next café, what  
is its prior? It could just use the posterior distribution from the first café as its prior for the  
second café. But that implicitly assumes that the two cafés have the same average waiting  
time. Cafés are all pretty much the same, but they aren’t identical. Likewise, it doesn’t make  
much sense to ignore the observation from the first café. That would be anterograde amnesia.  
So how can the coffee robot do better? It needs to represent the population of cafés and  
learn about that population. The distribution of waiting times in the population becomes  
the prior for each café. But unlike priors in previous chapters, this prior is actually learned  
from the data. This means the robot tracks a parameter for each café as well as at least two  
parameters to describe the population of cafés: an average and a standard deviation. As the  
robot observes waiting times, it updates everything: the estimates for each café as well as the  
estimates for the population. If the population seems highly variable, then the prior is flat  
and uninformative and, as a consequence, the observations at any one café do very little to  
the estimate at another. If instead the population seems to contain little variation, then the  
prior is narrow and highly informative. An observation at any one café will have a big impact  
on estimates at any other café.In this chapter, you’ll see the formal version of this argument and how it leads us to multilevel models. ""

This helped me a lot and the whole thing clicked for me. So, I wonder what other analogies you've encountered that helped you understand what's going on underneath a statistical concept.",114,30,MJORH,2021-05-27 22:14:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/nmj3na/question_what_analogies_have_helped_you/,0,statistics
mca93b,[D] stupid question: why doesn't deep learning always outperform classical machine learning and statistical models?,"A colleague was saying the other day, that deep learning models are like sports cars - they need a minimum distance to accelerate before they can reach their top speed. The same way, deep learning models don't perform well on smaller data sets where there is no room (i.e. not enough data) to rev their engine. Thats why a mountain bike (e.g. CART decision tree) can navigate a trail in a forest compared to a Ferrari (e.g. convoloution neural network). 

I really liked my colleagues analogy, but is there any math theory to support what they are saying? Are complex models (e.g. neural networks, svm) naturally (through their mathematical architecture) more susceptible to overfitting than a logistic regression or decision tree when exposed to smaller data? I feel there is an unspoken rule: ""in general, use complicated models on complicated data"". But is there any mathematical justification to support this?

I understand that sometimes deep learning models perform poorly because the analyst might not know how to use them properly (e.g. hyperparameter tuning) - but this doesn't reflect the model itself.

I know there is a theorem called the ""no free lunch theorem"" that shows by default, ""there is no single best algorithm for all problem"" - but can this theorem be used to somehow justify that smaller datasets don't require conplex models? I.e. is there some way to show that more complex models (e.g. suppose we quantify model complexity through the VC dimensionality) dont necessarily produce lower generalization error on smaller datasets?

So, given a very powerful computer that can simultaneously consider millions of hyperparameter combinations: can it be statistically shown that more complex models are not necessarily better for smaller data sets (e.g. iris data)?

13fu17a,[E] Motivating Example to (Benevolently!) Trick People into Understanding Hypothesis Testing,"I'm a PhD student in statistics and wanted to share a motivating example of the general logic behind hypothesis testing that has gotten more ""oh my god... I get it"" responses from undergraduates than anything else I've tried.

My hunch - almost everyone understands the idea of a hypothesis test inherently, without ever thinking about it or identifying it as such in their own heads. I tell my students hypothesis testing is basically just ""calling bullshit on the null"" (e.g., you wake up from a coma and notice it's snowing... do you think it's the summertime? No, because if it were summertime, there's almost no chance it would be snowing... I call bullshit on the null). The example I give below, I think, also makes clear to students why a null and alternative hypothesis are actually necessary.

The Example: Let's say you want to know if a coin is fair. So you flip it 10 times, and get 10 heads. After explaining the p-value is the probability, under the null, of a result as / more unlikely than the one we observed, most students can calculate it in this case. It's p(10 heads) + p(10 tails) = 2\*\[(0.5)\^10\] = (0.5)\^9. This is a tiny number that students know means they should ""reject the null"" at any reasonable alpha level, even if they don't really understand the procedure they are performing.

I then ask: ""Do you think this is a fair coin?"" To which they say, of course not! When I ask why, most people, after some thought, will say, ""because if it were fair, there's no way we would have gotten 10 heads"". I write this on the board. I then strike out ""because if it were fair"", and replace it with ""if the null hypothesis were true"", and similarly replace ""there's no way we would have gotten 10 heads"" with ""we'd see ten heads/tails only (0.5)\^9 percent of the time"". Hence, calling bullshit.

This is usually enough for them to realize that they use this thinking all the time. But, the final step in getting them to understand the role of the different hypotheses is by asking them how they got their p-value of (0.5)\^9. Why didn't you use P(heads) = 0.4 instead of 0.5? The reason is because the null hypothesis is that the coin is fair, meaning P(heads) = 0.5! This is the ""aha"" moment for most people, in my experience - **by getting them to convince themselves they HAD to choose a certain P(heads) to calculate the odds of getting 10 heads, they realize the role of the null hypothesis. You can't calculate how likely/unlikely your observed statistic is without it!**",115,37,sample_staDisDick,2023-05-12 19:06:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/13fu17a/e_motivating_example_to_benevolently_trick_people/,0,statistics
nxn6mg,"[D] Can we begin to understand possible mathematical reasons as to why algorithms like ""xgboost"" and ""random forest"" win Kaggle Competitions, instead of neural networks?","Could there be any mathematical reasons behind why algorithms like random forest and xgboost are known to win Kaggle competitions (i.e. perform well for medium sized tabular datasets) compared to deep neural networks and linear regression models?

Heuristically, here are my general conclusions:

1) GLM (general linear models) perform best on smaller sized datasets, provided certain statistical assumptions are met.

2) boosting and bagging algorithms (e.g. random forest and xgboost) perform best on larger tabular datasets, and do not require many statistical assumptions.

3) deep neural networks perform best on very large datasets, preferably on non tabular datasets (e.g. tensors, pictures, audio, computer vision, text/nlp).

But can there be any mathematical reasons that try to explain these general conclusions (provided these conclusions are correct)? 

For instance, suppose there is one response variable and one predictor variable, and when graphed together they look like a sine wave - it seems unlikely that a linear regression model could perform well. Perhaps this is because a linear model can only capture a linear trend? Perhaps it is too hard to understand the exact assumptions required for GLM models to work on real world data, or they are too prone to overfit on complex data?

The same way, is there any math that explains why alphaGO, self driving cars and Google's BERT NLP model are all based on neural networks - and not using random forest and xgboost? Is this because there is some mathematical property of random forest and xgboost which severely hinder their performance on very big and complicated datasets? Perhaps it can be shown theoretically that random forests require an exponentially large amount of trees to model complex data, which is just not computationally possible ... or would surely result in overfitting?

And the same way, is there any math that explains why deep neural networks aren't as successful as random forest and xgboost on medium sized tabluar datasets? Do deep neural networks simply require too much effort to select the right combinations of hyperparameters, and its just not worth it for medium sized datasets when random forests work well given significantly less effort? Are deep neural networks to prone to overfit medium datasets? 

Of course, all of this comes to down to trial and error: if a certain model fits the training and test data well - then use that model. But just using mathematical logic and intuition, can we develop some general guidelines that tell us which conditions and types/size of data are favorable for specific algorithms? This could potentially save us a lot of time by directly trying better suited models for the task at hand (e.g. not even trying to use logistic regression for alphaGO). 

So in the end: Beyond empirical results, could there be any mathematical reasons behind why random forest and xgboost are chosen in kaggle competitions compared to deep neural networks? And beyond empirical results, could there be any reasons why random forest and xgboost are not chosen for the ImageNet competition?

b66tb1,Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats),"https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/

The following is condensed from the author's tweet thread available here: https://twitter.com/jonaslindeloev/status/1110907133833502721

Most stats 101 tests are simple linear models - including ""non-parametric"" tests. It's so simple we should only teach regression. Avoid confusing students with a zoo of named tests.

For example, how about we say a ""one mean model"" instead of a ""parametric one-sample t-test""? Or a ""one mean signed-rank model"" instead of a ""non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test""? This re-wording exposes the models and their similarities. No need for rote learning.

Or in R: `lm(y ~ 1)` instead of `t.test(y)`. `lm(signed_rank(y) ~ 1)` instead of `wilcox.test(y)` The results are identical for t.test and highly similar for Wilcoxon.

I show that this applies to one-sample t, Wilcoxon signed-rank, paired-sample t, Wilcoxon matched pairs, two-sample t, Mann-Whitney U, Welch's t, ANOVAs, Kruskal-Wallis, ANCOVA, Chi-square and goodness-of-fit. With working code examples.

This also means that students only need learn three (parametric) assumptions: (1) independence, (2) normal residuals, and (3) homoscedasticity. These apply to all the tests/models, including the non-parametric. So simple, no zoo, no rote learning, a better understanding. 

But whoa, did I just go parametric on non-parametric tests!? Yes, for beginners it's much better to think ""ranks!"" and be a tiny bit off than to think ""magically no assumptions"" and resort to just-so rituals.

At this point, students know how to build parametric and ""non-parametric"" models using only intercepts, slopes, differences, and interactions. Students can also deduce their assumptions. Instead of just having rote-learned a test-zoo, they've learned modeling. 

Add the concept of residual structures and they've learned mixed models and can come up with RM-ANOVA on their own. Add link functions and error distributions and we've got GLMM. You can do prediction intervals and go Bayesian for the whole lot. 

Students will eventually need to learn the terms ""t-test"" etc. to communicate concisely. But now they have a deep understanding and a structure to relate these to.

How do I define and use my own functions? How do I define data structures like matrices or vectors and how do I use them in calculations? How do I download exotic packages that implement cutting-edge algorithms? How do I design my graphs down to the smallest details like I can with ggplot?

Can you even do all of this in SAS?? The book goes on and on for hundreds of pages about plotting basic data plots, importing data, or printing summary statistics ..

How statisticians were able to conclude that the V2 rocket bombings of London were truly random and not guided like how the British initially thought.

A sadder story: during one of the many points that the Challenger launch could of been aborted, how the engineers portrayed the data to higher ups (seriously its like 13 pages of basically just raw data) didn't really convince higher ups to stop the launch, but if the engineers had simplified the data into graphs they might of.

*note not blaming the engineers, they basically had an hour or two in the middle of the night just a few hours before the launch to come up with something....and they were under huge amounts of pressure. Just an interesting ""what if""

He then open a website, performed some statistical tests and said ""what i did just now in the blink of an eye, you are going to spend endless hours doing it by hand, and all that to gain a skill that is worthless for every employer""

60pjjx,Is Your Data LYING To You? The Simpson's Paradox,"This past weekend I was helping a friend at a local startup accelerator. He was really frustrated - after making a few adjustments based on the data he collected - his profits seemed to have gone **DOWN** - *instead of up.*

&nbsp;

Since he ""followed the data"", he was convinced that he made the right decision. He asked me to help him figure out what went wrong. 

&nbsp;

Turns out... his data was literally ""lying"" to him. This wasn't a case of ""garbage in = garbage out"", but one of those rare/tricky incidents where *your data can actually trick you into making the **OPPOSITE** decision*.

&nbsp;

I decided to write a post explaining (and an [Animated Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj2QV7cfUfQ)) how this happens so you guys don't get fooled down the line. I use the **UCBerkeley Sex Discrimination Law Suit** example, and a **business case example** to illustrate. 


&nbsp;

Take the time to read through this - it may pay off sometime down the line. For those of you who want to watch an illustration (easier to understand) here's the video: **[YouTube - Simpson's Paradox Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj2QV7cfUfQ)**


&nbsp;


**Simpson’s Paradox - How Data Can Fool You**


------------------------------------

Data - data - data. We’re increasingly becoming a society obsessed with data!i Important decision-making  meetings will often parrot the phrase “Well...What does the data say”.

Being “data-informed” is all well and good. But using it at face value to drive decision making can be rather dangerous. In this post, we will discuss one of the ways data can trick you into making the wrong decision - The Simpson’s Paradox.

In 1973 UC Berkeley was sued for sex-discrimination. It turned  out of all the female students who applied - only 35% of them were admitted.  While  out all the male students who applied 44% of them were admitted. 


&nbsp;

        |  Applicants  |    Admitted | 
---|------|---|
 Men| 8442 | 44% |
Women | 4321 |  35% |



&nbsp;

The data raised a lot of eyebrows. And the witch-hunt was on! UC Berkeley set out to  find the main culprits of this gender discrimination.

To do this they broke open the data to see which departments were mainly responsible for this GENDER BIAS ---  And here is what they found:

&nbsp;

Department | # No. of Men| #No. Of Women| Men Accepted| Women Accepted|
---|------|------|------|------|------|
A | 825 | 108 | 62% |**82%** | 
B | 560 | 25 | 63% |**68%** | 
C | 325 | 593 | 37% |34% | 
D | 417 | 375 | 33% |**35%** | 
E | 191 | 393 | 28% |24% | 
F | 373 | 341 | 6% |**7%** | 
- | Total 8442 | Total: 4321 |  | | 


&nbsp;

Now this is where the data gets funny. After breaking open the data, we see a different story.  Out of the 6 departments 4 of the departments accepted women more than men. There definitely was a gender bias - but it was in favour FOR the women. Not against!
&nbsp;

But that begs the question? Why did the aggregated data tell a different story? 

&nbsp;

This is a classic case of the Simpson’s Paradox -  when grouped-up data tells the opposite story of the ungrouped data.  This happens because of a confounding-factor that is hidden from sight WITHIN the data.

&nbsp;

So what’s this “hidden factor” that’s causing all the mischief? Take a look at firstand the last rows of the table. You’ll notice that Department A has a pretty high acceptance rate - especially for women at 82%!  However, out the 4000+ women only a 108 of them applied to Department B. That’s only 2% of all women who applied across departments.

&nbsp;


On the other hand, 825 of the men applied to Department A! That’s 10% of all the male applicants. You may have already spotted the mischief. But let’s go on.  Take a look at the last row. Again, the women have a higher acceptance rate than the men. But over here - Department F, in contrast to Department A, has a very LOW acceptance rate.

&nbsp;

And this is where it goes wrong. Compared to the men,  a much larger portion of the women applied to this low-acceptance department.  Around 4% of all the men applied here. While 8% of all the women applied to Department F. So in truth, women weren’t being discriminated against. It just so happened that a large proportion of them were applying to a low-acceptance rate department while a large proportion of men were applying to high-acceptance rate department. That skewed the overall results.


&nbsp;

This sort of data mischief - The Simpsons Paradox - can happen everywhere. Even in businesses who use data to make decisions. Here’s a business-case example. A CEO and his team were deliberating whether to use a One-Click advertisement campaign or Two-Click campaign. That’s when the marketing manager - who happened to support the Two-Click campaign showed him some data:


&nbsp;

                 | #Users (mil)  | Rev (mil) | Rev per thousand users |
--------------|-------------|------- |------------|
Single Click|230 Users  |$2.9 |11.60 RPM  |
Double Click  |140 Users  |  $1.7  | 12.14 RPM  |


Single Click had more users allocated to it, and thus more revenue - but the RPM (revenue per thousand users) is higher for double click. When you look at the data - the decision is obvious. Double Click is generating more money per user - so they should go with double click, correct? 

&nbsp;

Turns out, picking the Double-Click campaign would have been a costly mistake. Let’s break open the data again - into its subgroups of International users and Local users:

&nbsp;

                             | #Users (mil)  | Rev (mil) | Rev per thousand users |     User% Per Group
------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------|
 Single Click-Local     |      50 Users   |       $1.8   |         25.71 RPM   |                        42 %  |
 Double Click-Local      |     70 Users      |   $1.2     |       24.00 RPM        |                   58% |
 Single  Click-Inter         |   180 Users     |   $1.1         |   6.11 RPM         |                   67% |
 Double Click-Inter  |      90  Users   |       $0.5        |   5.56 RPM          |                  33% |


&nbsp;

Suddenly, the data tells a different story. Single click is outperforming Double-Click in both subgroups - Local AND International? How is this possible?

&nbsp;

Simpson’s Paradox at play again. The grouped up data has a hidden factor that tells the opposite story of the ungrouped data. In this case, the hidden factor was that only 33% of international users were shown the double-click page, while only  58% of the local users were shown the double-click page.

&nbsp;

And in general the local users had a much higher RPM than international users. So the local users who had a much higher proportion of double click users and a higher RPM skewed the overall data.

&nbsp;

**Final Thoughts**

This was a tough example. Take a minute to  analyse the data. Simpson’s Paradox can be tricky - the key is to look out for any hidden variables that may be influencing your data!  Don’t rely too much on your data. If something smells fishy - look into it. Do not trust your data blindly.  Use your data to formulate hypothesis and be data-informed, not data driven. Test your hypothesis, if it goes wrong, you know you need to look for something else.

agp07z,Monthly Domain Discussion: Introduction to Graphical Models ~ Jan. 2019,"# Introduction to Graphical Models

## I. Introduction

A graphical model consists of a graph (directed or undirected), where we associate with each node in the graph a random variable. The most important examples are when all of the random variables are jointly Gaussian, in which case we have a Gaussian graphical model, or when all random variables are discrete and take only finitely many values.

The graph structure and the joint distribution of the random variables are related in the following way: the graph structure specifies what conditional independence statements must hold for the probability distribution. Think about the graph structure as specifying a set of rules that the joint distribution of the random variables must satisfy, such as: ""the random variable associated with node 1 is conditionally independent of the random variable for node 2, conditional on all of the other random variables"". If a probability distribution respects the rules specified by a given graph, we say that the distribution factorizes according to the graph.

Intuitively, you should think of an edge in the graph as encoding an ""interaction"" between the random variables, which allows there to be additional dependencies between the random variables; on the other hand, the lack of edges enforces independence constraints on the distribution. The complete graph (in which all possible edges are present) encodes no constraints, so any distribution factorizes with respect to the complete graph. On the other hand, the graph with zero edges corresponds to probability distributions for which all of the random variables are independent.

One of the motivations for graphical models is that they provide tractable models for statistics. If we consider a fully general joint distribution, then the size of the description of the joint distribution can be exponentially large (in the number of nodes) and this makes many of the common tasks (marginalization, simulation, computation of expectations, etc.) intractable. Graphical models provide useful families of more constrained distributions for which algorithms have been developed to carry out common tasks. Moreover, the graph structure can encode domain knowledge.

Even if you have not seen graphical models in a formal context before, you have probably seen examples of them already. Markov chains are graphical models whose graphs look like paths (lines), and graphical models also encompass hidden Markov models. If you work on Bayesian statistics, then hierarchical Bayesian models are also often represented as graphical models.

## II. Current Understanding/Research

A lot of research has centered around the question of finding efficient algorithms to perform inference on graphical models. To give you an idea of the kinds of tasks that we want to accomplish, usually the probability distribution of a graphical model is defined up to a proportionality constant. The proportionality constant is fixed by the normalization constraint (probabilities must sum to one) but calculating the normalization constant exactly is often intractable. Some inference tasks of interest are: (1) given the probability distribution (again, up to normalization constant), can we find the marginal distribution of a single random variable? (2) can we compute the normalization constant (also called the partition function)? (3) can we sample from the distribution? (4) can we compute conditional distributions? (5) can we find the mode of the distribution?

It turns out that these computational tasks are all morally equivalent, in the sense that if we could solve any of them efficiently, then we could solve the other tasks efficiently too.

Famously, there is a family of so-called message-passing algorithms for the task of marginalization. The big caveat with these methods is that their convergence is not guaranteed for graphs with cycles (called loopy graphs in this literature). Nevertheless, these algorithms are used in practice because they are fast and often reliable; for example, I hear that these algorithms are used to decode error correcting codes in your phone. One major direction of research is to better understand the convergence of these algorithms.

Another family of algorithms is sampling. Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) methods are often used to sample (approximately) from the distribution. The main drawback for these methods is that in practice, it is difficult to diagnose if the Markov chain has converged or not.

Some more recent directions of research try to compute deterministic approximations for the normalizing constant. One approach proceeds more analytically, looking at polynomials associated with the normalizing constant, and another approach constructs families of upper or lower bounds (these last methods are called convex programming hierarchies).

Finally, it is of interest to learn a graphical model from data. In high-dimensional statistics, we may also posit that an underlying graphical model is sparse, and attempt to learn a sparse graphical model through algorithms such as the graphical LASSO.

## III. Application/Importance to Broader Statistics

Graphical models are applied very frequently in Bayesian statistics. As you are probably well-aware, Bayesian statistics faces many computational issues, and traditional Bayesian statistics uses conjugate prior distributions mainly for the sake of making the computations tractable. However, conjugate priors are not suitable for all applications (and some have philosophical objections to conjugate priors anyway), so the ideal situation would really be to further develop our computational toolkit and allow Bayesian statisticians to use whatever priors they want. The development of algorithms for Bayesian statistics goes hand-in-hand with research in graphical models.

Although I realize that this is not the statistics that this subreddit focuses on, there are also rich connections to the field of statistical physics. Roughly speaking, statistical physics considers probabilistic models for physical systems, such as spin systems, and tries to understand what qualitative behaviors emerge. That is, even though the system is modeled probabilistically because we do not know the exact state of every particle, we can observe emergent phenomena at the macroscopic level. Graphical models are actually exactly the kinds of models studied by statistical physics; for example, the Ising model is also a graphical model.

Many statistical physicists come from physics, and they bring to bear physical intuition to analyze random models. It has been a major research effort to put certain physical predictions on firm mathematical footing, and although there has been a lot of progress recently, there is still more work to be done. The most exciting part, in my opinion, is that nowadays the field has also attracted computer scientists, who have realized that probabilistic (""average-case"") models of many classical computational tasks are also very similar to statistical physics models. This has led, for example, to the investigation of phase transition phenomena for satisfiability problems.

Graphical models provide a unified approach to many classical algorithms in electrical engineering and computer science. To name a few, there are algorithms for hidden Markov models (forward-backward, Viterbi, Baum-Welch) and the Kalman filter. As such, graphical models find much use in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Finally, a recent approach to high-dimensional statistics can be described as follows. Many problems have a parameter which determines the signal-to-noise ratio, and under the right scaling, high-dimensional statistics problems often exhibit a phase transition in which detection is impossible for certain values of the parameter, and possible for other values of the parameter. This is an information-theoretic limit of statistics. However, near the threshold (when estimation is still possible in principle), there are often no known efficient algorithms to construct an estimator. This is known as a statistical-computational gap [there is conjectured to be a gap, but we do not know how to fully prove that one exists], and it is conjectured in many instances that the algorithmic threshold (the signal-to-noise ratio required for efficient estimation) is predicted by the threshold at which message-passing algorithms start to fail. Overall, understanding the statistical-computational gap better, and its connection to message-passing, would be a monumental achievement for modern statistics.

## IV. Resources/Textbooks

A well-known survey of methods for graphical models is by Wainwright and Jordan: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/Papers/WaiJor08_FTML.pdf. Although it is a survey, it is not light reading, so if you are looking to get exposed to this area then you should start with a more introductory book.

The book ""Information, Physics, and Computation"" by Mézard and Montanari introduces statistical physics and its connections with message-passing algorithms. If you decide to learn more about statistical physics, then you can also read Talagrand's two-volume ""Mean Field Models for Spin Glasses"".

Sampling and MCMC methods have been very well-studied. ""Markov Chains and Mixing Times"" by Levin, Peres, and Wilmer is a great introduction to the theory of Markov chain mixing, and ""Monte Carlo Statistical Methods"" by Robert and Casella is a book devoted to sampling methods which discusses many practical issues too.

MSBA student here. My experience with calculus and linear algebra was solid enough for my ML modeling classes. But I've found bayesian statistics to be one of the trickier topics for people, like me, who use statistics in some capacity but are not aspiring to be domain experts. This YouTube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwJRxp3blEvZ8AKMXOy0fc0cqT61GsKCG) has really helped me get an appreciation for the higher level concepts. 

My friends who *are* aspiring statisticians generally say they learn from a bottom-up approach, where individual building blocks are introduced and from them bigger structures/concepts are discussed. Personally, I find a top-down approach more helpful as I have context to inform where the conversation is headed. 

If you're a top-down learner, interested in expanding your bayesian statistics knowledge, this resource might help a good deal. However, it probably will not explore sufficient subject depth for someone in an MS/PhD Stats program.

a965oj,Author refuses the addition of confidence intervals in their paper.,"I have recently been asked to be a reviewer on a machine learning paper. One of my comments was that their models calculated precision and recall without reporting the 95% confidence intervals (or some form of the margin of error) or any form of the margin of error. Their response to my comment was that the confidence intervals are not normally represented in machine learning works (they then went on to cite a journal in their field that was paper review paper which does not touch on the topic).

I am kind of dumbstruck at the moment..should I educate them on how the margin of error can affect performance and suggest acceptance upon re-revision?

rvuj4r,[Q] Why did Karl Pearson call the Gaussian distribution ' Normal Distribution' ?,"I came across this quote from Karl Pearson "" *Many years ago \[in 1893\] I called the Laplace-Gaussian curve the* ***normal*** *curve, which name, while it avoids the international question of priority, has the disadvantage of leading people to believe that all other distributions of frequency are in one sense or another abnormal* ""

And recently I also came across this tweet ""Originally, Gauss (in 1823) used the term ""normal"" (in the sense of ""orthogonal"") referring to the geometric interpretation of a system of linear equations from which the distribution bearing his name is derived ""

So my question is two fold :

1) Did Gauss originally use the term 'Normal' referring to the geometric interpretation of a system of linear equations ?

2) Was Pearson influenced by Gauss' s original usage of the word 'Normal' and therefore used the word 'Normal curve' or 'Normal Distribution'.",96,4,venkarafa,2022-01-04 13:35:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/rvuj4r/q_why_did_karl_pearson_call_the_gaussian/,0,statistics

gomejb,[D] Do you ever push back when reviewers ask for p-values or p-value corrections? Any success?,"Like most statisticians I mostly think p-values should be removed from the world (or maybe just hid from non-statisticians, idk). I'll just put the question first for TL;DR: when some reviewer asks for p-values (or corrections to them) that you know have no scientific/philosophical/logical reason to be shown, do you ever give pushback and explain why? Or will they always just think you're hiding something and keep demanding them? (I'm new to the publishing space)

My story: was recently asked to produce two graphs of 4 markers that are either up or down depending on the disease state, and together help predict said disease state. The first graph was for the model training data, the second was for the validation data on 100 patients enrolled for the study (i.e. an independent test set). For both I was asked to do p-value corrections. The statistician in me wants to do no p-value correction, and not even show p-values for the second graph.

Why? Because those 4 markers were chosen (among thousands of candidates) after cross validation on a big discovery dataset consisting of data from dozens of combined studies, all done way before parameter tuning on the training dataset (again using cv), with similar high AUCs for both. At that point, we are no longer doing blind investigational hypothesis testing on these 4 markers. The accuracy metric (AUC) when using these markers speaks for itself, why formalize 4 new hypothesis tests for these markers that we already carefully chose out of thousands? If they aren't truly different but by chance gave us a great AUC, we will already detect that when testing this thing because it would have poor performance in a brand new test data set. Speaking of which...

The second graph is on 100 patients we enrolled. The AUC is very similar to the model training dataset as well as the boxplots for the 4 markers. This already tells us that the relationships continue to hold in our test data. Given this, why on earth would we say ""okay, now let's investigate 4 *new* hypotheses! Do these 4 markers vary in quantity depending on the disease state for these 100 new patients? Let's start by stating the null hypothesis: they.....aren't?""

2.) Explains in exacting detail how everything was developed and why -- but also assumes I have already memorized all puny undergraduate stats methods and, in my free time, laughingly tear asunder mortal datasets with the sheer power of my mathematical intuition

k0575z,"[D] Pros and cons of ""new-age"" degrees, MSBA, MSDS, etc","In this post, I want to summarize my experience in an MS Business Analytics, marketability as a data scientist, draw some contrasts with more traditional degrees, etc. I completed my MSBA in May this year, was offered two data scientist roles, one at a late stage startup, another at a less prestigious but certainly ""big name"" tech company. 

The required coursework was mainly databases, traditional stats/ML, a python/R know-how course, and a capstone project. Electives ranged from business/domain specific courses like ""revenue management"" (demand forecasting, logistics scheduling/allocation, and dynamic pricing, etc) to analytics courses like ""deep learning"" (neural networks, probabilistic graphical models, reinforcement learning, etc.) 

In general, the lectures were theory based while the homework assignments were programming heavy. However, the emphasis wasn't on navigating proofs but on understanding models enough to diagnosis when they went awry and why. For example, a module on Bayesian stats and Gibbs sampling, we discussed what the conditional distribution of multivariable gaussian *is*, but we were not required to memorize half a page of linear algebra to prove it.  

In the industry, data scientists normally come from one of five pipelines: **Computer science, statistics, hard/soft sciences** (everything from physics, computational biology, economics, etc.), **""new age degrees""** (data science, business analytics, etc), and **self taught**. The work culture, however, is very much decided by the statisticians and computer scientists, more or less in a vacuum. 

From my limited time working with statisticians, they're thrilled when they understand how changes in one variable affect their expectations of changes to another, and exploring whether that relationship is universal or limited to a certain subdomain, if it's causal, etc.. By contrast, computer scientists (in my experience) view statistics as a theoretical framework for models and not much more. The ""high five moment"" is deploying a model to automate some task with high accuracy, which customers/users interact with; far less emphasis is placed on understanding the data generation process. 

I mention this because you'll undoubtedly work for bosses who subscribe to one of both cultures in the industry. From my MS/PhD statistics colleagues, their curriculums prepared them to answer questions like, ""does is the data compatible with the assumptions of this model?"" and ""what variables should be included on a causal basis?"" Whereas my computer science colleagues tend to throw 5-10 models at a problem and let ROC/AUC sort it out for them. Where they shine however, is integrating these models into production, asking the right questions of software engineers, database architects, etc to streamline their efforts. 

The industry is increasingly interested in problems that cannot be solved by traditional methods. For example, summarizing customer complaints on Yelp, not simply sentiment, but extracting noun phrases like ""rude wait staff"" or ""cold entrees"". Likewise, ideas from operations research, emphasizing combinatorial optimization is gaining traction, like Lyft's ability to pair drivers and passengers dynamically given changing demand with temporal and spatial components.

The pros of an MSBA is that it samples topics/models to solve a variety of high impact problems. However, the drawback is that the theory isn't robust enough for you to know how to design novel statistical tests autonomously. In my current role I almost exclusively use bayesian methods over any other statistical/ML model choice. I routinely need to look at prior and posterior predictive checks with actual statisticians to validate my reasoning; I'm learning a lot along the way, but grad school did not make me a self-sufficient Bayesian; it made me a generalist.       

Big picture, an MSBA will prepare you for a data science role if you lean into the analytics electives, whereas it will prepare you for a marketing/business/product analyst if you focus on the business electives. As far as professional vehicle goes, I think it's optimized for job placement; however, if you're interested in a stats PhD or research heavy role, for example, I don't believe it's the best choice available.",96,20,None,2020-11-24 13:43:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/k0575z/d_pros_and_cons_of_newage_degrees_msba_msds_etc/,0,statistics

atk1zq,A Tutor Told My Student That Statistics Don’t Matter and She Won’t Need to Know This Information in Life,"Mods, if this does not fit here, I apologize. I thought it might be in line with the college advice topics. Please let me know if there is somewhere better I should post this. 

I am a Graduate Teaching Assistant for my university’s Statistics Department. Part of my job is being available to help students in their undergraduate statistics courses. Our lowest level class focuses on basic statistics, such as measures of center and spread, the normal model, simple linear models, and sampling methods and distributions. This is the class that most majors require when you need to know how to use/interpret statistics, but you don’t need to necessarily find them on a regular basis. Examples of majors that require this class are Family Science, Psychology, Sociology, Nursing, etc. We teach how to find these statistics by hand so that they can have a deeper understanding of where they come from and how to interpret them correctly. 

None of us are naive enough to think that students take this class out of enjoyment or passion. The majority of these students HATE math and anything to do with math, but I make sure to tell them why this class is important—not just for their majors, but for their lives in general. 

Cue Ignorant Tutor, who is not part of our department (we hope). As he was helping a student in this class, he tells her that she’s not going to need to know anything that she’s working on later in life and that it’s not important, so she shouldn’t worry about it. 

When she told me this was said to her, I was *furious!* First I made sure she knew I wasn’t mad at her, and then we had a huge discussion about how insanely wrong that was. 

We talked about several of the different ways she will need to interpret statistics correctly, from statistics being misinterpreted in the news to bias in sampling methods, to different examples of statistics that she will need to navigate in her major. She left happier at the end, but I was livid. 

Learning this material is hard enough, but then being told that the class you’re taking is meaningless and a waste of time is so defeating! Also, it undermines everything we do. 

I think it is likely that this Tutor meant that they won’t need to know how to calculate z-scores in their careers. This is true, but it was not the message that got across, and it doesn’t make it okay. 

My boss is just as livid as I am and is filing a formal complaint today. 

I’m sorry that this was more of a rant than anything else. I hoped this community would understand my frustration. If there is a better place to post, please let me know. 

TL;DR: Don’t tell my students statistics aren’t important. 

Edit: several people are under the impression I think statistics are necessary for every walk of life. I apologize for giving that impression. I believe very much that having a basic understanding of how statistics work, which is the extent of what this class teaches, is crucial to wade through our lives critically and to avoid gullibility to misinterpreted statistics. But I am aware that it is not necessary for life: just really really helpful. 

However, for this situation, that is less important than the fact that her major REQUIRES this class, as is the case with all of my students, and they require it for a reason. Her major will encounter statistics throughout nearly every class, as well as tables and charts that need to be read accurately. Being told that she would not need statistics was inaccurate and demeaning to her major’s coordinators, implying that they made her take the class for no good reason. 

Edit 2: I just want to thank everyone for the fantastic discussion. My emotions have cooled off (partially thanks to you guys and partially due to time), and I very much appreciate the devil’s advocates. It has been really nice having a discussion with differing opinions that doesn’t involve doubling down and ad hominem attacks.

I immediately noticed that he had a single coefficient for multicategorical variables like marital status, or level of education, meaning he just chucked them into the model treating them as quantitative variables. 

Fair enough, beginner mistake, so I told him to create indicator variables with the desired contrast coding and rerun the analysis. He then proceeded to tell me that he was replicating what he had seen in an article, and sent me some screenshots from at least 4 regression models with exactly the same mistake. Apparently, they had been published in prestigious journals.

Essentially my main question is, **when statisticians say R-squared, is the default assumption that you're computing the in-sample R-squared? If so, why?** 

For context, my background is more computer science and machine learning than statistics, and whenever we report any metric on a model the default assumption is that this metric has been computed on some form of held-out data. As I understand it, this practice came from statistics, and even in most statistics papers I've read cross-validation seems more or less ubiquitous. (Unfortunately, in ML it's most typically done with a single randomly selected held-out sample rather than doing a full cross-validation, but still.) Even the name of the statistics stack exchange is cross-validated, so it seems like it should be a pretty fundamental idea for the field.

**I've been thinking about all of the complaints about R-squared, and it seems to me that most of them are only valid complaints if you're talking about in-sample R-squared. Is this a correct assessment?** If so, why do so few of the warnings not just recommend computing a safe out-of-sample R-squared (ideally using cross validation)?

Below, I'll run through some of the common complaints about R-squared that I think might be invalid complaints for out-of-sample R-squared. If someone could point out holes or misunderstandings that would be great! Thanks in advance for your help (the quotes from Shalizi are from [here](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/mreg/15/lectures/10/lecture-10.pdf)):

*  ~~Adjusted R-squared is better than R-squared because r-squared rewards models that add spurious predictors since even random noise will improve r-squared~~: This is the one I'm most confident about being easily fixed by making sure you're always using out-of-sample R-squared. Fitting a parameter for random noise will almost certainly not result in an improvement on out-of-sample predictions.
* ""R-squared can be arbitrarily close to 1 when the model is totally wrong"" -- Shalizi: If you can achieve an R-squared of arbitrarily close to 1 on held-out data, that means you can predict things arbitrarily well. I'm not sure exactly what it would really mean for a model to be completely right (""All models are wrong, but some are useful"" and all that), but if you can get arbitrarily good predictions on unseen data, I'd have to call that a pretty good model.
* ""R-squared is also pretty useless as a measure of predictability""-- Shalizi: Here Shalizi actually does mention out-of-sample estimates, and if I understand him correctly he's saying it would solve the problem here, but I'm not completely sure. Certainly for direct understanding of predictability I can see why there are settings where having something in the units of the response/target variable would be nice (like standard error of the regression or even RMSE), but it also seems that in many cases it would be  nice to have a unit-less measure that would enable some level of comparison across datasets. 
* ""R-squared cannot be compared across data sets...exactly the same model can have radically different R-squared values on different data."" -- Shalizi: To be honest, I'm not sure precisely what point Shalizi is trying to make here. Does he mean the R-squared of the same regression model (i.e., with some fixed fitted parameters)  on two different datasets coming from the same data-generating distribution? Does he mean the same model class (i.e., ordinary least squares linear regression) but fitted on two different datasets? In any case, his argument seems to be based on math that I think only applies when the parameters are estimated on the same dataset on which you're calculating R-squared, and thus might be solved by using out-of-sample R-squared?
* ""R-squared cannot be compared between a model with untransformed Y and one
with transformed Y , or between different transformations of Y"" --Shalizi: Again, I have to confess, I'm not quite sure exactly what he means here. Actually, here, I'm not sure I see why this is true even for in-sample R-squared. If you apply an invertible transformation to the response variable and end up improving the R-squared, is this really not evidence that the fitted model for the transformed data better captures that data than the fitted model for the untransformed data? If anyone could elaborate on the point, I'd really appreciate it. 
* ""In nonlinear regression, SS_Regression + SS_Error do not equal SS_Total! This completely invalidates R-squared for nonlinear models, and it no longer has to be between 0 and 100%."" from [minitab blog](https://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/why-is-there-no-r-squared-for-nonlinear-regression): I agree that we lose the nice idea of SS Regression + SS Error adding up to SS Total for nonlinear regression, but I don't see why this means we'd need to throw out R-squared entirely. If we define R-squared as 1 - SS_residual/SS_Total, it's certainly still certainly bounded above by 1. I supposed it's no longer technically bounded below by 0, but in practice I think it would be. The only time when you'd end up with a negative R-squared is if your model is literally worse than a model that predicts the sample mean, which probably won't happen very often. Even if that is the case, I don't see why the existence of negative R-squared values means R-squared isn't useful.
* ""[Spiess and Neumeyer](https://bmcpharma.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2210-10-6) performed thousands of simulations for their study that show how using R-squared to evaluate the fit of nonlinear models leads you to incorrect conclusions. You don't want this!"" -- [minitab blog](https://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/why-is-there-no-r-squared-for-nonlinear-regression): I would certainly find this quite convincing except if I understand the referenced paper correctly they're using in-sample R-squared. Of course the model with the best in-sample R-squared might not be a good model! You can improve in-sample R-squared by overfitting. You can't improve out-of-sample R-squared by overfitting, though.

Are my assessments above reasonable and correct?",89,39,drazilraW,2020-05-21 20:45:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/go4woi/q_is_rsquared_actually_useless/,0,statistics

kp0br9,[Q] Frequentist vs Bayesian approaches to Gaussian Processes?,"I've been reading this [blog post](http://krasserm.github.io/2018/03/19/gaussian-processes/), which has been tremendously helpful in understanding Gaussian Processes (GP.) The author has used the terms ""prior"", ""posterior"", and ""95% confidence interval"" throughout; this made it difficult for me to tell if he was approaching GP from a Frequentist or Bayesian perspective. In equation 11, he defines the log marginal likelihood then uses scipy to optimize the hyperparameters, L and Sigma. He doesn't explicitly call it ""MLE"" but the concept seems analogous enough for me to consider his approach Frequentist. **(Is this valid?)**

And if so, how might a Bayesian approach GP? My currently thinking is: Rather than optimize the log marginal likelihood for point estimates of L and Sigma, sample hyperparameter values from the joint distribution. **(Is this valid?)**

Lastly, the author makes some decisions that made the distinction between paradigms a little blurry for me. Namely, early in the article he discusses the prior, sets arbitrary values for L and Sigma, generates some fake X input data, then uses the `Kernel(X,X)` to generate a multivariate gaussian (w/ one dimension per data point) and samples from this multivariate gaussian 3 times to show what this ""prior over functions might look like"". And this has caused me a decent amount of confusion as it sounds quite Bayesian.

Maybe the Frequentist vs Bayesian construct isn't a thing in the GP world and it borrows elements from both schools of thought.

Questions, comments, and tangents are welcome!

Edits: After reading through comments here, as well as related [Cross Validated Stack Exchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/503213/frequentist-vs-bayesian-approaches-to-gaussian-processes) posts, I've come to realize that there is quite a bit of debate whether GPs are a frequentist or bayesian concept. The author of the blog linked at the top, does specify priors and does use likelihood maximization methods to arrive at optimal kernel hyperparameters. Personally, I believe this approach viewed through a Bayesian lens is effectively MAP estimation for GP.",92,21,None,2021-01-02 16:25:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/kp0br9/q_frequentist_vs_bayesian_approaches_to_gaussian/,0,statistics
gowxg8,[Q] Please explain how to use p-value to a physician.,"Please forgive my stupid question , but I'm a physician who must appraise journals routinely to decide which treatment should be given for patient. Mathematics is really not my strong point and I have a hard time understanding what P-value means. In medical school, we were just taught the quickest, dirtiest way to interpret it, that is, p-value is the probability that the result is like that because of random occurrence. If < 0.05, then it is not statistically significant meaning there is no difference/don't use that result, which I take that as a very grossly oversimplification of p-value though it is often treated as the holy grail in discussions. I would greatly appreciate explanation in layman's term which can guide me to intuition of what a p-value is and when it is appropriate to look for the p-value of a result.",92,64,Flince,2020-05-23 02:20:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/gowxg8/q_please_explain_how_to_use_pvalue_to_a_physician/,0,statistics
g1srmx,"[Education] I'm doing fine in my M.S. program, but worried about how much I'm retaining/truly comprehending. Anyone else have this problem?","I'm doing an M.S. in Statistics part time at a fairly well-respected program  (working full time, a few years out from undergrad). It's been a little tough for me because of my weak math background - I basically have the absolute minimum amount of college math you can have and still get into one of these programs (calculus and basic linear algebra, a good chunk of which I don't remember very well). Despite that, I've managed to do fine grades-wise in my Math Stats and my Methods courses - I'm almost done with my 'core' classes and moving on to some applied electives.

&#x200B;

What worries me, though, is that I've always been a very good test taker, and I sometimes feel like I've just strategically navigated these courses to get the best grade possible without deeply understanding the material. I feel like I still struggle with an intuitive understanding of some of the concepts, and if someone asked me on the spot to explain the finer points of the differences between MoM and Likelihood estimators, or how to prove that something is a BLUE, or to intuitively describe a Beta or Gamma distribution, I would fall flat, to give just a few examples. I would need to go revisit my Math Stats notes and do some heavy review to feel even a little comfortable talking about them - so when my Methods prof says something like ""You'll recall from Math Stats how we proved that \[x\]..."", I definitely do not recall that!

&#x200B;

Anyway, maybe it's not the end of the world because I plan on taking a very applied focus anyway, but it bugs me that I'm almost done with 4 Master's-level stats classes and still feel this shaky on core statistical concepts (admittedly one of those 4 classes was just a SAS/R programming course). A big reason I chose this degree instead of, say, business analytics, was that I wanted to overcome my previous struggles with math and feel like I actually had a solid grasp of this, but so far that hasn't happened really. Does anyone else have these insecurities/any advice or tips on how to feel like I have a better handle on this, other than just going back and re-reading my notes from previous classes on a regular basis (already trying to start doing that)?

gikhqk,[Discussion] Why do you love Statistics?," tl;dr: Why do you love stats and why is it useful?

I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor's in statistics. I'm looking for a job, but then I got pensive and questioned if I even want to work in this field. I like math, but I don't really seem to enjoy statistics. With math, although there are many ways of arriving at the answer, there is always one correct answer. With statistics, it feels more like an art to me: people have to be creative in the way they choose to model things and different people will have different answers/conclusions because ultimately it's up to their own reasoning and judgement. There's no one answer. Because of this, I can't help but feel that statistics is just guesswork even though I know this isn't true.. but I just can't seem to convince myself otherwise.

Don't get me wrong, I know the value in statistics. It's used by big tech companies, sports teams, etc. and people with knowledge in stats are highly coveted by employers because of the explosion of data in today's world.

I'm not even sure why I'm making this post, but I believe enthusiasm is infectious so maybe I just want some insight from a community who loves statistics so that I can appreciate and understand it more. Why do you love stats? How would you explain the usefulness of it? How would you convince someone who doesn't believe in stats that's it's not just guesswork?

- Would it be worth doing a conversion masters to statistics? Are these normally well-regarded/good quality, or is it very institution-dependent?

8uw5c2,Currently employed as a data scientist but am worried because my statistics skills are deteriorating. What should I be doing to find a new role?,"I posted this in /r/datascience two weeks ago and didn't find much useful advice.  Figured it's worth a shot posting here because this sub has more people with strong statistics backgrounds.  I’ve already decided that I’m changing jobs so please don’t give me a list of reasons to stay.

I've been employed for almost two and a half years.  Graduated undergrad in 2014 and finished a Master's in Statistics from a top West Coast university in 2016.  I was the person my peers would go to for help with statistics questions and sometimes still get hit up by old friends to help them out.  I didn't do a thesis for various university bureaucratic reasons I'd prefer not to get into, and an internship I did between years turned out to have no data analysis component at all.  My undergrad was similar.  I'd take an internship or a research position where I was told I'd be doing interesting data analysis work.  Then once I got there it would turn out that I'd have no mentorship or that actually I'd be doing some other task that requires coding but no statistics, but has some vague data-related component.  Because of this I have very good technical skills in SQL, Python, and R, but not much experience applying them to solve analysis or machine learning problems.

My dilemma is I've had two data scientist positions at medium-sized companies where I've done very little analysis.  The first one was sold to me as an analysis/engineer position, but I did one analysis in the full year and a month I was there and the rest was focused on data quality control.  I was laid off because they claimed to not have any data analysis work available for me.  My current position is awesome except for the actual work.  I've been there for 18 months and I've just done exploratory analysis and dashboarding, with zero statistics.  My current company has cool ML work, but a conversation with my boss indicated that he thinks it's a giant waste of time that doesn't help the business.  He won't let me take on ML work, even though it's one area where I have a ton of interest.  We have no procedure for internal transfers and don't see any way to obtain one without his approval.

I'm at the end of my rope and want to do more meaty and quantitative work than what I'm currently doing, which to be blunt, bores the living shit out of me.  I'm a statistician by trade who has done no statistics in two and a half years years.  However job hunting has been quite difficult.  There don't seem to be many modeling focused positions even when I look for other job titles like ""Applied Scientist"".  I've been heavily targeting particular companies I want to work at and getting referrals, but have been rejected at the resume stage for many junior-level roles where I'd be doing modeling.  I've had my resume looked over by a bunch of people and none of them see anything wrong with it.  Because of my lack of professional statistics experience, my resume focuses on my ability to work with a diverse variety of professionals, gathering requirements, and presenting deliverables in a way that's useful for them.  Essentially all of the soft skills I'd expect to use in a more standard data scientist position.

Based on what I've indicated here, what kinds of positions should I be looking for?  Should I be targeting positions where I'm doing modeling and predictive analytics positions, or is my lack of experience in those areas going to fuck me over?  If I shouldn't be targeting those roles yet, what kind of roles should I be targeting to get there?  I'm currently targeting large companies because I feel like the bureaucracy will allow me to get experience precisely in what I get hired to do, rather than getting sidetracked with things like ""Oh I'm a senior person you do data please do this data task that has no analysis or statistical component.""

Additionally, how can I convince recruiters that I should be hired to do explanatory or predictive modeling work?  I'm in touch with a recruiter at a large tech company who tried to sell me a Data Scientist position that turned out would be all A/B testing and dashboarding, which would be my personal hell as a career.  When I asked him about potentially taking on a meatier role building models he said I should be looking at more basic positions that are similar to the A/B testing one.  I've had back-and-forths on LinkedIn with recruiters for some other positions that are advertised as Data Scientist positions, but when I ask how much of the role involves pipelining and wrangling for tasks other than doing data analysis, I almost always find out that they're doing a bait-and-switch and it's actually a 100% engineering role.

I'm quickly approaching the three year mark where junior careers usually end and feel completely stagnant and like I have nothing to show for it.  I have job security where I am now but if circumstances change, it's going to be far more difficult to continue on an upward career path than it is now.

If it helps I'm in the Greater Seattle Area, living downtown and working in Redmond.  There are some Meetups that look potentially nice but they're all sponsored by boot camps and the last time I went to a talk at one of them, it was basically a pitch for why you should give them money.  I have contacts at many large companies in the area, and those contacts can vouch for my enthusiasm and skill around statistics.",89,63,dsnextsteps,2018-06-29 19:57:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/8uw5c2/currently_employed_as_a_data_scientist_but_am/,0,statistics
10s9w7e,"[Research] Statistics on social-science statistics: ""Observing many researchers using the same data and hypothesis reveals a hidden universe of uncertainty"" ""These results call for greater epistemic humility and clarity in reporting scientific findings""","[Observing many researchers using the same data and hypothesis reveals a hidden universe of uncertainty](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2203150119)

> ## Abstract

> This study explores how researchers’ analytical choices affect the reliability of scientific findings. Most discussions of reliability problems in science focus on systematic biases. We broaden the lens to emphasize the idiosyncrasy of conscious and unconscious decisions that researchers make during data analysis. We coordinated 161 researchers in 73 research teams and observed their research decisions as they used the same data to independently test the same prominent social science hypothesis: that greater immigration reduces support for social policies among the public. In this typical case of social science research, research teams reported both widely diverging numerical findings and substantive conclusions despite identical start conditions. Researchers’ expertise, prior beliefs, and expectations barely predict the wide variation in research outcomes. More than 95% of the total variance in numerical results remains unexplained even after qualitative coding of all identifiable decisions in each team’s workflow. This reveals a universe of uncertainty that remains hidden when considering a single study in isolation. The idiosyncratic nature of how researchers’ results and conclusions varied is a previously underappreciated explanation for why many scientific hypotheses remain contested. **These results call for greater epistemic humility and clarity in reporting scientific findings.**",88,22,AlexCoventry,2023-02-03 03:31:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/10s9w7e/research_statistics_on_socialscience_statistics/,0,statistics

18758n0,[Q] Brazen p-hacking or am I overreacting?,"Had a strong disagreement with my PI earlier over a paper we were working through for our journal club. The paper included 84 simultaneous correlations for spatially dependent variables without multiple comparisons adjustments in a sample of 30. The authors justified it as follows:  
""...statistical power was lower for patients with X than for the Y group. We thus anticipated that it would take stronger associations to become statistically significant in the X group. To circumvent this problem, we favored uncorrected p values in our univariate analysis and reported coefficients instead of conducting severe corrections for multiple testing.""

They then used the five variables that were significant in this adjusted analysis to perform a multiple regression. They used backwards selection to determine their models at this step.

I presented this paper in our journal club to demonstrate two clear pitfalls to avoid: the use of data dredging without multiple comparisons corrections in a small sample, and then doubling down on those results by using another dredging method in backwards selection. My PI strongly disagreed that this constituted p-hacking. 

I'm trying to get a sense of whether I went over the top with my critique or if I was right in using this methods to discuss a clear and brazen example of sloppy statistical practices.

kwj1yc,"[Q] Having doubts about statistics, can anyone relate?","Hi guys and girls,

I  just finished a course on Categorical Data Analysis where Agresti's  book was the assigned literature. Earlier I wanted to change profession  to something more focused on data and I've been studying some stats,  linear algebra, etc. but find myself both overwhelmed and doubtful about  the methods used, especially after this course. First off, it's hard.  It's really really hard. Going back to uni which assumes fluency in  calculus, linear algebra, and stats was quite the wake-up. I had my  first stats course at uni over 10 years ago.

However,  at the end of the day, I can't shake the feeling that assumptions made  often feels... questionable. Afterwards a flood of derivations follows  which builds on this assumption and continues to build. The focus is so  much on mathematical derivation that I'm not sure why some things are  done in the first place. I get the feeling that I want to push a  stop-button and ask if these methods even work in the real world, and  how we know that (addressed to the field as-whole, not a specific  chapter in a book).

Can anyone relate?

k4nmkj,[Career] Anybody here contemplating a change of career?,"I've been doing a lot of thinking career-wise, currently working as a data scientist in the UK but getting so so tired of the grind. PhD in a stats field, which seems to be interpreted as ""kick me"". For me, the problem is the hype and expectations. Some of the people (and managers) I've worked with are completely divorced from reality. I'm thinking about a complete change of career.

My current workflow is:

1. Manger/C-level exec reads something outlandish, wants to replicate it. Makes outlandish promises too other people.
2. Non-technical manger scopes it, does a poor job; doesn't look at the data or think about how to integrate the new proposed system into the existing system; doesn't understand what's needed and throws the project at you.
3. The scope, budget, time-scale and resources have all been decided for you. ""Heres the data"", nobody bothers to see (or ask) if the data has value or is in any way related to the problem. ""Its data, it's the new oil"", ""All data has equal value \[a medium article told me so\]"". Nobody ever seem to say; ""we have data what can we learn from it""? It's ""I want X and here's some data"".
4. Project is not a two-way street; there is no appetite experimentation. You spend most of your time managing expectations, bring people back down to earth and trying to reduce scope etc. Non-technical manger doubles down on scope, budget etc. and blames project shortfalls on everybody but themselves.
5. Final project is nowhere close to what the original manager thought was possible; they are bitterly disappointed but never stop to ask themselves if they were part of the problem. At the retrospective its concluded that ""more communication is needed"".
6. Rinse and repeat.

Then there are some of your fellow data scientists who are quite happy to turn out unworkable models, butchered the stats, but claim victory. Top manager see this (and this person) as a success and sees you as somebody who is a bit too pessimistic with estimates and deliverables. I mean we can all throw non-symmetric bimodal data at model that assumes Gaussian data and call it a win, but to me that's just BS. Maybe I'm wrong; maybe I too need to start ""bending the truth"".

Besides (some of this comes verbatim from my other post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/k450xq/anybody\_moved\_from\_software\_devdata\_science\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/k450xq/anybody_moved_from_software_devdata_science_to/)):

* The hype train has left the rails and reached orbit. You are constantly up against inhuman targets. Unbelievably 40% of European AI start-ups, claiming to use ""AI"", don't actually use any AI?! \[1\]. Company execs are literally just gaslighting one other at this point?!
* There's no barrier to entry like there is in other fields. Anybody can call themselves a data scientist or statistician.
* Data science is increasingly becoming automated.
* Data science can easily be outsourced.
* Many DS employer expect you to have ""passion"". I don't see this kind of cult culture in other fields.
* I feel like DS, and Software development (SD) careers are a race to the bottom: DS and SD literally give code away for free: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/), companies in need of data science solutions offer prize money, instead of hiring a team to complete the work: [https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/)

Is this the wrong field for me? I'm burning out; I want to work in a field where you aren't expected work miracles while competing colleagues that are peddling snake oil.

* What are your careers like?
* Have I just been unlucky with the companies I've worked in?
* Is this standard? Is there grass greener elsewhere?

d6dai1,[Q] How much statistical knowledge do you forget? Why do you think that is?,"Long version: I am 30 years old and I have been working as a statistical engineer or industrial statistician for 7 years. In that time I have worked in a variety of methods and topical areas, including reliability analysis, time series forecasting, regression from simple linear to mixed-effects models, design of experiments from 2^2 to highly fractionated and response surface designs, any topic in quality control; parametric and nonparametric methods, continuous and categorical data, a variety of software methods and programming languages, and so on.

The thing is, I feel like I have forgotten most of what I have learned, maybe 90%-95%, hell maybe more. Some stuff I have learned but never actually used, like Dixon's outlier test. It's understandable to forget that I guess. But even stuff I have used in-depth I have forgotten; I'd be lying if I told you I could build or properly explain an ARIMA model without consulting reference materials. Honestly I think I may be hard-pressed to do a one-way ANOVA by hand! At least without screwing it up a few times. At the very least I don't seem have any problems learning new methods, comprehending techniques, or implementing learned methods with reference material.

Is this normal?

My undergrad was in physics and pure math, and I have no graduate education. In physics especially, understanding concepts and relationships was key. Rote memorization was not essential, but being able to derive or recreate a result using principles and reasoning was critical. Is that maybe why I have a tough time recalling specifics?

Also I know there are definitely some gaps in my statistical knowledge, for example I'm pretty weak on Bayesian methods, I've never touched something like survey design, and I've covered probability theory but not a ton of statistical theory (equivalent of about 60% of Casella and Berger I'd guess).

TL;DR

1) I seem to forget most statistical knowledge I've learned, is anyone else the same way? If so, why do you think this is?

2) If this is unusual, could this be due to my educational background, work history, etc. or am I just wired differently? (I'm perfectly OK with this!)

The dude I’ll be working under is an MD PHD who is focused on developing new methods which in his words are “really f***ing simple.” My experience with stats has been the equivalent of the introductory stats course at a college and some work in research which involves biostats (this was a lot more mechanical).

He recommended that I read and understand the elements of statistical learning (textbook which is available free as a pdf.) I have burned through ISLR 7th ed (introduction to statistical learning) but it was a much more focused reading on certain methods for my work. I would love to understand the math behind everything so I can hopefully keep pace at my new internship. 

Alternatively, if anyone has any resources on learning about the math behind statistical learning techniques please let me know!

Thanks for your time!

Edit: Hot dayum this post garnered a lot of attention. I am going to add a couple of things real quickly, I have two time frames to learn this, the first is around a month, the second is until around Christmas break. Because of this I will be blowing through the book for quite a while until my fall semester starts, then I will revisit each chapter at a slower pace.

I would also like to clarify that I might not do all the labs in the coming few weeks, I am targeting lower level comprehension and the ability to look at a formula and know what it does. Of course, I will be doing some side projects later on.

Finally, a few people have pmd me asking if this is on Slack or Discord. I am honestly fine with either, but I have much more experience and an affinity for Discord, especially since we can set up targeted channels for each chapter and a few more for questions, projects, etc. If y’all can let me know your preference through posting or pms I can go ahead and get started tonight itself.

Side note: Some of y’all are grad students, some are just interested in the topic. I myself am still in undergrad and I really only know just enough so that I can publish my manuscripts in medical journals. That translates to a pretty surface level understanding of stats with maybe a slightly deeper focus on some topics. I’d like this to help everyone though. 

Edit 2: This is going to be on Slack, I am gonna pm all the replies here with an invite link. If you are interested but don't want to post here for some reason, pm me and I will send you the link. If I skip you by accident, pm me and I will send you the links

Edit 3: I just got home and it’s 2 am. I’ll do my best to add everyone tomorrow! If for whatever reason I don’t and you want to be added, go ahead and send me a message again. I’m a bit leery of putting this up as a public thing because then it’s accessible by anyone, which is a scary thought. I’d prefer this admittedly rudimentary layer of protection. But who knows, after I wake up and exercise, I might end up just posting the link.

Edit 4: Back from the gym and I've added everyone who has replied or messaged me. If any of you have significant experience with this already, and would love to help out all of us, please let me know and I'd honestly be happy to have you!",87,89,ThiccThrowawayyy,2018-08-05 23:23:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/94w72n/would_anybody_like_to_study_elements_of/,0,statistics

What type of problems are you typically assigned to analyze? 

Why the Bayesian approach over frequentist, or ML? 

What is included in a completed project? A final report with credible intervals? Explanations of models? A software? A point estimate? 

What programming languages/packages/software do you use? Do you write up a model and inference from scratch or use probabilistic programming languages?

Bayesian inference is notoriously computationally expensive, how has this impacted your analysis (if at all)?

Here's the [link](https://stars.bilkent.edu.tr/syllabus/view/IE/523/20161?section=1) for the syllabus (also see the weekly schedule I quoted below), which uses Resnick's ""A Probability Path"" as one of the textbooks, and from which you can find more practice on the materials presented in the lectures.

As a data scientist and someone who wants to study statistics at the graduate level in the future, these videos are absolutely invaluable to me (as I'm not masochistic enough to read through a book on measure-theoretic probability). I find the prof's accent perfectly acceptable, and he seems quite engaging as a lecturer. 

I hope these videos will be useful for other folks who want to self-study advanced probability like myself. The [Youtube channel of the university](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrU4smtf9hhG7lkdqyDV48A) also features many other full-length courses in economics, psychology, physics, etc. They also maintain a [listing](http://video.bilkent.edu.tr/department_menu.php) of courses with accompanying videos, although perhaps not as up to date as with their Youtube channel.

169s9qv,[Q] Most embarassing post of the decade: how to remember precision/recall?,"(tl:dr at the bottom)

This is incredibly embarassing and I hope that this is not too stupid of a question for this sub. You may think I am trolling and I wouldn't be surprised if people will downvote this into oblivion. Yet it is a real issue for me and I am being brutally honest and vulnerable here, so please lend me a minute of your time. 

I am very educated (PhD) with a background in an applied field in Computer Science. While I think that titles like that do not matter much, it does mean that people have an ""expectation"" when I talk to them. Sadly, I feel like I do not hold up to those expectations in that I have the worst memory in the whole universe and I do not come across as a ""learned"" individual. I cannot remember important things - even in my personal life, e.g. I forget the names of my sibling's children. (Honestly wondering whether it is a medical issue; my AD meds might have something to do with it.) I am obsessively good when solving a problem, when I can apply myself and make use of resources. Yet anything that requires me to memorize or basically ""know"" a definition is problematic because I need to look it up before I can continue.

With that background out of the way, I am looking at Reddit for help to remember these two different terms: precision and recall. I find it easier to remember things with small word plays or a visual story behind it but I haven't found a good one for these two. God knows how often I have looked these up, used them, and then forgotten or mixed them up few moments later, which is always very demotivating and makes me feel stupid. It doesn't help that English is not my first language.

Tl:dr: do you have a good mnemonic or other device to help you keep these two apart that you can share?

I'm about to graduate with my masters in statistics, and I had one class that covered few weeks on each of those topics, but that's it (the class was honestly so disorganized that I feel I barely retained anything from it and I could've learned a lot more, but that's a separate rant that's really not relevant).  I've just not been given the opportunity to work on it anymore.  Other than that, I've been a data analyst for the past 3 and a half years, but I haven't done any of that cutting edge stuff.  It's been basic summary statistics, automating processes with R / SAS, that kind of stuff.  

Looking at data analyst postings, they definitely seem more entry level and I definitely qualify for them. And as a trend they seem more friendly to new grads in that they don't expect proficiency in what they need you to do yet, they train you to get you there.  That's what happened at my current job. Don't get me wrong, if I lose my job and get hired as a data analyst somewhere else, I'd be happy to even have an income in this economy, but I'd like to break into data science.  The problem is I don't see how I'm going to acquire these skills because none of the data analyst positions list anything about them.  In other words, there's positions that want proficiency with these skills, but seemingly no positions that are willing to help you learn them, like there are with data analysis. 

Would I qualify for the full-fledged data science positions? Are there keywords I should be searching for positions that do this kind of thing but are willing to bring me up to speed rather than expecting proficiency from the get-go? Is there anything I can do on my own? I was thinking it'd be cool to work on some project on my own time but I don't even know where to start.",83,77,smmstv,2020-04-23 13:05:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/g6ma9p/q_is_there_a_such_thing_as_an_entry_level_data/,0,statistics

>Researchers have shown it takes about ten years to develop expertise in any of a wide variety of areas, including chess playing, music composition, telegraph operation, painting, piano playing, swimming, tennis, and research in neuropsychology and topology. The key is deliberative practice

>Get interested in programming, and do some because it is fun. Make sure that it keeps being enough fun so that you will be willing to put in your ten years/10,000 hours.

>Program. The best kind of learning is learning by doing. 

>Talk with other programmers; read other programs. This is more important than any book or training course.

>If you want, put in four years at a college (or more at a graduate school).

>Work on projects with other programmers. Be the best programmer on some projects; be the worst on some others. 

>Work on projects after other programmers. Understand a program written by someone else. 

*****

>So go ahead and buy that Java/Ruby/Javascript/PHP book; you'll probably get some use out of it. But you won't change your life, or your real overall expertise as a programmer in 24 hours or 21 days.

pyqqis,[E] I'm creating a rigorous free online lecture series on regression and kernel methods!,"After my studies in business psychology, I did not lose my interest in statistics and have acquired considerable knowledge in the field of statistical learning theory over the past few years, largely through self-study. This knowledge helped me to land a job as a Data Scientist for a large German insurance company two years ago.

Recently, I have been keen to share the knowledge I have gained. Therefore, I created a 150 pages long slidedeck on the topic of regression and kernel methods, which I present on YouTube:

The whole thing is dressed up as a Machine Learning lecture series, but I don't shy away from presenting proper statistical learning theory rigorously: I introduce the principle of empirical risk minimization, present some prediction error decompositions, solve several variants of (kernel) regressions, define the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and show useful properties of the functions within these spaces, before finally connecting the frequentist motivated kernel formalism and Gaussian processes as a Bayesian idea.

Please let me know how you like the treatment of this material! Also feel free to make suggestions for future lecture series (or video ideas in general).

I am trying to explain to my non-technical team how to interpret a 95% confidence interval, and want to be careful about how to phrase it.

I have heard that “we’re 95% correct that the true population parameter is in this interval” is incorrect. From my understanding, the proper interpretation is more along the lines of “95% of the time the interval will contain the true population parameter”.

I am having trouble explaining that in a more intuitive way, probably because I don’t understand it enough.

kzweg5,[D] Thoughts on Bayesian Neural Networks?,"I'm interested in the community's thoughts on the future of Bayesian NNs in statistics. I generally feel that gradient-based NNs come across a bit as a heuristic method. Every paper about LSTMs, CNNs, etc. to me seems like variations of, ""We added more complexity, we got more accuracy!"" Bayesian NNs by contrast use variational inference (supposed to be much faster than MCMC sampling) to reduce the divergence between distributions as a training method. Despite the potentially many layers of complexity, you'll get a posterior distribution over predictions, which enables the NN to say, ""I think this AND I'm this confident."" So the methodology is quite a bit different but the interpretability seems to be fairly similar to other Bayesian non-parametric methods.

hercv7,[E] How did you arrive at a decision to do a PhD in statistics?,"Hi folks, I am sure a number of you here have applied or considered to do a PhD in statistics at one point. Doing a PhD is different from a masters in that it requires a good chunk of time during prime of your life and you might not even graduate on time depending on how your research progresses. Basically I feel that statistics is one of those areas that a PhD can bring you far and bring you a great amount of independent work. Of course, you also need to have the passion to do research.

If you have been at one of these crossroads and **chose to walk away** from the opportunity to do a PhD, may I know why?

\- Work experience is definitely more valuable than the experience of a Phd? Prime years to gain a foothold financially?

\- Did you feel that career progression was slower than peers who did have a PhD? For example, they have the opportunity to tackle on more challenging projects?

If you have been at one of these crossroads and **chose to do the PhD**, what are the reasons that motivated you?

\- Better career progression long term w a PhD?

\- Did you feel that upon graduation you have access to more opportunities or most industrial jobs prefer candidates with more work experience ?

\- As a PhD student, how did you ensure that you were developing your career/ and gaining work experience on the side as well (eg through internships in summer)?

\- Do you feel that the opportunity cost of doing the PhD is too much?

I am living in Canada and am presented with an opportunity to do a phd in something i like. However, having worked for two years in a ds role in a startup, i also considered the opportunity cost as well of doing a phd and how a phd delays plans for financial independence.

I just want to seek out opinions here and hopefully have a discussion that might be of use to others in future as well

72qon9,LPT: Everything you do must be reproducible,"I don't really come from a statistics/data science background, and don't have a lot of formal training outside online classes, but have ended up in a position where I do a ton of data analysis on a daily basis. And goddamn do I wish someone sat me down and explained this to me sooner.

The reality is it is SO EASY to mess something up and end up with data that looks right but isn't. Forgetting to enable the weights in a survey, messing up the filter in a SQL query, using count instead of distinct count in a pivot table, etc.

I've had clients come back to me four months after a project saying they got different results when they ran the data. Fuck if I know, time to spend 5 hours re-running everything. SAVE YOUR WORK.

I once got to the end of 6 weeks worth of data runs and analyses for a client. Went to double check the data in the final report and couldn't reproduce it. I had no idea what I had run and didn't know if I messed up early or was messing up now. Turns out it was earlier and had to re-do everything. SAVE YOUR WORK.

Most of my day to day work is in excel and SPSS. Unfortunately that means a lot of it is in GUIs that can't be reproduced, so I've been slowly integrating more and more R.

I know is one of things that most of you are going to be like ""duh,"" but on a deadline or just doing exploratory analysis, it's so easy to take shortcuts and forget to do it.",82,18,qabadai,2017-09-27 07:18:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/72qon9/lpt_everything_you_do_must_be_reproducible/,0,statistics

1bmmkl8,[Q] What is the worst published study you've ever read?,"There's a new paper published in *Cancers* that re-analyzed two prior studies by the same research team. Some of the findings included:

  
1) Errors calculating percentages in the earlier studies. For example, 8/34 reported as 13.2% instead of 23.5%. There were some ""floor rounding"" issues too (19 total).

  
2) Listing **two**\-tailed statistical tests in the methods but then occasionally reporting **one**\-tailed p values in the results.

  
3) Listing one statistic in the methods but then reporting the p-value for another in the results section. Out of 22 statistics in one table alone, only one (4.5%) could be verified.

  
4) Reporting some baseline group differences as non-significant, then re-analysis finds p < .005 (e.g. age).

Also, full-disclosure, I was part of the team that published this re-analysis. 

  
For what its worth, the journals that published the earlier studies, *The Oncologist* and *Cancers*, have respectable impact factors > 5 and they've been cited over 200 times, including by clinical practice guidelines.

  
How does this compare to other studies you've seen that have not been retracted or corrected? Is this an extreme instance or are there similar studies where the data-analysis is even more sloppy (excluding non-published work or work published in predatory/junk journals)?

p6lr2d,[R] New theoretical article argues that researchers should not automatically assume that an alpha adjustment is necessary during multiple testing,">A distinction is drawn between three types of multiple testing: *disjunction testing*, *conjunction testing,* and *individual testing*. It is argued that alpha adjustment is only appropriate in the case of disjunction testing, in which *at least one* test result must be significant in order to reject the associated joint null hypothesis. Alpha adjustment is inappropriate in the case of conjunction testing, in which *all* relevant results must be significant in order to reject the joint null hypothesis. Alpha adjustment is also inappropriate in the case of individual testing, in which *each* individual result must be significant in order to reject each associated individual null hypothesis.

zpkgan,[E] I have recently have been part of the admissions process for my department's PhD program. AMA,"Having been on Reddit for a while now, albeit under different aliases, I found the r/statistics community supportive and received a lot of good advice - among the bad - when I was applying to graduate school and as I applied for tenure track jobs. Last year, a pretty reputable statistics department was willing to take the chance to hire me as a tenure track professor.

Because of how the Reddit community welcomed my questions and addressed my concerns, I thought I would give back to the community, especially as some of you have applications coming due very soon. Recently, I had the privilege to participate in my departments application review for our next PhD cohort. Now, applications are still under review by a final committee and chair, but my job in reading and providing feedback is done. 

I'm not sure how many of my colleagues lurk here too so in effort to preserve my privacy, simply take what I say as my two cents. I understand opinions are vast and different; what I may recommend may contradict what others may say. 

I cannot provide a numerical answer for anyone's acceptance rate, nor will I be proofreading any SOP's. But I can provide recommendations of where, how, or when to apply based on academic/research backgrounds and career goals.

kr1t2t,[Career] [Question] What are non-professor jobs like?,"Hi, I'm a relatively recent PhD graduate in quantitative psychology. Virtually my entire professional experience has involved working with and towards the ""typical"" R1 type professorship (i.e., they teach at a university level, but only a couple courses a year, with a greater emphasis on getting grants and publishing). That's left me with a blind spot with regards to what other professions look like. I'm not even really clear on what positions look like at, for example, health science centers attached to universities, and I'm even less certain about what is involved in industry positions. So I'm curious, especially for people not in a teaching/PI position, what's a day in your work like? Is it the 9-5 dream job of perfect fulfillment solving the problems of the universe, or just a pitiless slog through millions of meaningless t-tests until your heart gives out from boredom (or, you know, something in between)?

I've been giving some thought to possibly pursuing non-professor type positions, but a secondary concern of mine is that my methods knowledge might not be flexible enough for problems outside of academia. I'm pretty solid on standard methods used in psychology (e.g., general linear models, SEM, multilevel models, some IRT, some survival analyses, etc.) but things like machine learning are new to me and I have no formal training in them beyond a few classes on k-nearest neighbors and a few other clustering algorithms. (Watching some youtube videos I was able to write a neural network from scratch that could play flappy bird. So I can do more than absolutely nothing, but not much more than nothing machine learning-wise.) So, what methods are common outside of academia? Looking at job ads, virtually everything mentions machine learning, but I frequently doubt that the person writing the job ad knows what the best method for the job is, and I suspect that they just latched onto the current statistical buzzwords for about 90% of the ads.

I suspect some people are going to suggest that I talk to my academic advisor, and other people who I know, about these questions, and I fully intend to (and have in the past), but I thought I would cast a wide net to see what other people have to say.",75,18,None,2021-01-05 16:30:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/kr1t2t/career_question_what_are_nonprofessor_jobs_like/,0,statistics

xz2fvt,[Q] Are there any affordable online masters degrees in statistics,"I currently work as a data scientist for a company that thinks all data science is is building models. I disagree and feel we’d be better off applying statistical methods and models depending on the situation. 

I want to get my masters in statistics, but a lot of programs are expensive, especially since I won’t really see that big of a bump in salary since I already have a job as a data scientist. 

That said, I’m ambitious and take pride in my work. I don’t just want a title, I want to be really good at my job. I thought about teaching myself, but I have adhd and would struggle without some structure as I’m the type of person who will have a lot of questions, so teaching myself completely would be hard. So enrolling I’m a program would be idea.

I looked at coursera and edX, but really only see programs with two or three courses rather than a full program. Besides thoughts, what I see seems to be in data, for example, the Georgia Tech data program would be amazing as it’s 10 grand, but it doesn’t have enough focus in statistics for me. 

I’d love advice on how to proceed to pay for a masters in statistics (are there scholarships?) or maybe if there is a series in books or online learning for linear algebra and statistics that you all recommend, I’d willing to give that a shot since you all would know best.

n7stif,[Discussion] Opinions on Nassim Nicholas Taleb," 

I'm coming to realize that people in the statistics community either seem to love or hate Nassim Nicholas Taleb (in this sub I've noticed a propensity for the latter). Personally I've enjoyed some of his writing, but it's perhaps me being naturally attracted to his cynicism. I have a decent grip on basic statistics, but I would definitely not consider myself a statistician.

With my somewhat limited depth in statistical understanding, it's hard for me to come up with counter-points to some of the arguments he puts forth, so I worry sometimes that I'm being grifted. On the other hand, I think cynicism (in moderation) is healthy and can promote discourse (barring Taleb's abrasive communication style which can be unhealthy at times).

My question:

1. If you like Nassim Nicholas Taleb - what specific ideas of his do you find interesting or truthful?
2. If you don't like Nassim Nicholas Taleb - what arguments does he make that you find to be uninformed/untruthful or perhaps even disingenuous?",72,86,weareglenn,2021-05-08 16:27:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/n7stif/discussion_opinions_on_nassim_nicholas_taleb/,0,statistics
kodfw5,[E] Seeking Advice About Stats PhD/Masters," 

Hi all! This is my first post here, so mods please feel free to take this down if it's better suited for another subreddit.

 I'm a current junior in undergrad (graduating spring 2022) considering applying for a graduate program in Statistics for fall 2022 and was hoping for some feedback/general suggestions based off of my current background and experiences.

Some info about me:

* Math major with minors in Stats and Data Science
* Potentially relevant coursework includes Theoretical Linear Algebra (proof-based), Single- and Multi-Variable Real Analysis (proof-based, Math Masters-level), Probability, Statistical Inference, Data Mining, Predictive Analytics, Big Data Analytics (CS Masters-level), Computational Learning Theory (proof-based, CS PhD-level), and another Probability course this upcoming semester (proof-based/measure-theoretic using Durrett, Math Masters-level)
* 3 independent studies with a grad student mentor in topics of personal interest like Parametric Time Series Analysis, Stochastic Calculus (w/ Financial Applications), and Causal Inference (w/ Applications to ML)
* 2 summers of research (one in HS, one in undergrad) in developing statistical methods with a Stats professor at a public university
* 1 semester of research at current university doing a causal inference case study with a Stats professor
* Super informative summer internship working in Data Science for a US government regulator
* Comfortable with programming in R and using basic LaTeX
* (Hopefully) interning as a Statistical Analyst or Data Scientist this upcoming summer to gain further experience

I’ve really enjoyed my coursework/research in Statistics thus far and would love to pursue it further. Pursuing a higher degree in Stats isn't a super common path at my undergrad, so I figured this would be a great place to learn more. Any and all feedback into what sorts of programs/resources are worth looking into or general advice for things to do so I can better prepare myself before applying are really appreciated - thank you!

I just want to vent and hopefully receive some replies and answers that will make a more optimistic about studying statistics. 

We have models, like Bass diffusion, which depend on parameters which are harder to quantify than the problem they're supposed to solve; we have numbers given to us from high (Google's suggestion that 5-10 folds is good enough for k-fold cross-validation). And of course p=0.05 as a defacto standard of important enough.

Our tools just feel broken. Matlab results wildly vary depending on whose machine and what phase of the moon. I have never encountered a programming language as counterintuitive as R. Excel can't figure out whether it wants to do math in binary or decimal. All of them built on top of probably-insufficient RNGs. 

There are enough model-selections to make me wish for a model-selection-selection method. 

Then there's the practice. How are there so many models in the wild that are such textbook examples of overfitting that anyone with an Intro course should be able to spot them? What percentage of medical studies can't be reproduced? And it feels many people have abandoned any attempt for causal explanation because fuck it, understanding is hard and processing power is cheap.

17ksg0e,[D] How many analysts/Data scientists actually verify assumptions,"  
I work for a very large retailer. I see many people present results from tests: regression, A/B testing, ANOVA tests, and so on. I have a degree in statistics and every single course I took, preached ""confirm your assumptions"" before spending time on tests. I rarely see any work that would pass assumptions, whereas I spend a lot of time, sometimes days going through this process. I can't help but feel like I am going overboard on accuracy.  
An example is that my regression attempts rarely ever meet the linearity assumption. As a result, I either spend days tweaking my models or often throw the work out simply due to not being able to meet all the assumptions that come with presenting good results.  
Has anyone else noticed this?  
Am I being too stringent?

I've heard squaring the distances from the mean makes the resulting numbers easier to work with. If this is true, why does it make things easier (aside from producing positive values)?

mkc134,[Education] Machine Learning / Econometrics Tutorials with R,"So last week I posted a question on r/nba about whether people would be interested in R tutorials about NBA Data Analysis and got a lot of interest.  I made my first post there earlier today, but it got taken down quickly because of ""self promotion"". My intention was to get beginners interested in data science by focusing on a topic that would be of  interest  to them, but I guess it didn't work out.

The tutorials where meant cover the basics of R and machine learning and econometrics for beginners. The tutorials will also include appendices that go into the ML algorithms and other derivations somewhat rigorously (theory, matrix calculus, optimization theory and the works), so I thought they might be of interest to people here. So if people here are interested in ML, econometrics, R and basketball, hopefully this could be of use.

8v4zp4,Python vs. R,"As a long-time user (and lecturer) of R, I am wondering why Python seems to be so widely used in statistics.

I love Python, it's a great language. Use it all the time. But I just researched how to run a logistic regression (to do something that's a bit more difficult than just OLS) in Python and it was surprisingly complicated. In R, it could hardly be easier: Just use multinom from nnet and you can immediately use all the standard idioms that one knows from so many other kinds of models.

I then tried to look up arguments in favor of using Python when it comes to statistics, but they were surprisingly superficial. For example, it was often said that Python allows doing *more* than stats in one script. While true, is that really *better*?

Why is Python so widely used? It seems like R in conjunction with dplyr and other useful packages is vastly superior when it comes to stats. (Even though I love Python in general.)",78,82,None,2018-06-30 21:12:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/8v4zp4/python_vs_r/,0,statistics

1du3r0,Favorite Statistics Joke?,"So one of friends who's a fellow math major got me a math joke book for Christmas, and he was encouraging me to tell one of the Stats-related jokes during class. I was ready to tell the following joke from the book, which most of you have probably heard already:


*A statistic professor plans to travel to a conference by plane. When he passes the security check, they discover a bomb in his carry-on-baggage. Of course, he is hauled off immediately for interrogation.*

*""I don't understand it!"" the interrogating officer exclaims. ""You're an accomplished professional, a caring family man, a pillar of your parish - and now you want to destroy that all by blowing up an airplane!""*

*""Sorry"", the professor interrupts him. ""I had never intended to blow up the plane.""*

*""So, for what reason else did you try to bring a bomb on board?!""*

*""Let me explain. Statistics shows that the probability of a bomb being on an airplane is 1/1000. That's quite high if you think about it - so high that I wouldn't have any peace of mind on a flight.""*

*""And what does this have to do with you bringing a bomb on board of a plane?""*

*""You see, since the probability of one bomb being on my plane is 1/1000, the chance that there are two bombs is 1/1000000. If I already bring one, the chance of another bomb being around is actually 1/1000000, and I am much safer...""*

mi6jaj,[R] Cross-validation: what does it estimate and how well does it do it?,"[http://statweb.stanford.edu/\~tibs/ftp/NCV.pdf](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ftp/NCV.pdf) (Bates, Hastie & Tibshirani; March 31, 2021)

**Abstract**

>Cross-validation is a widely-used technique to estimate prediction error, but its behavior is complex and not fully understood. Ideally, one would like to think that cross-validation estimates the prediction error for the model at hand, fit to the training data. We prove that this is not the case for the linear model fit by ordinary least squares; rather it estimates the average prediction error of models fit on other unseen training sets drawn from the same population. We further show that this phenomenon occurs for most popular estimates of prediction error, including data splitting, bootstrapping, and Mallow’s Cp. Next, the standard confidence intervals for prediction error derived from cross-validation may have coverage far below the desired level. Because each data point is used for both training and testing, there are correlations among the measured accuracies for each fold, and so the usual estimate of variance is too small. We introduce a nested cross-validation scheme to estimate this variance more accurately, and show empirically that this modification leads to intervals with approximately correct coverage in many examples where traditional cross-validation intervals fail. Lastly, our analysis also shows that when producing confidence intervals for prediction accuracy with simple data splitting, one should not re-fit the model on the combined data, since this invalidates the confidence intervals.",76,14,Bayequentist,2021-04-01 22:20:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/mi6jaj/r_crossvalidation_what_does_it_estimate_and_how/,0,statistics

And I feel as if i understood things better when i had a very surface level understanding after learning it for the first me than i do now. For instance, it is so increasingly hard for me to comprehend conceptually hypothetical repeated sampling, when we only have one sample. How its even possible to take a piece of paper and pencil, and derive the behavior of say of the OLS estimator or sample mean across a completely hypothetical idea of repeated sampling, when we often just have one sample. Also the fact that the central limit theorem is even a thing. that we even can approximate real work behavior as a normal distribution with all the nice properties it brings (thats suspiciously convenient, no?). How the hell did we come up with a way to get over the fact that we don't know the population variance,i.e. invent the t distribution?

ma108w,"[D] What allows algorithms like ""random forest"" and ""neural networks"" to effectively analyze complicated data?","Lately I have been thinking and reading about some of the background details of popular machine learning algorithms such as ""neural networks"" and ""random forest"". In particular, I am trying to understand the justification as to what allows these algorithms to be so effective at analyzing complicated data (e.g. non linear) . Based on what I have read, this is what I have concluded so far:

1) When it comes to neural networks, theorems from the field of real analysis such as ""the universal approximation theorem"" show that a neural network can approximate any function within a particular error range. The idea being, this idea generalizes to any function (linear, non-linear, etc.).

2) When it comes to random forest, the initial paper demonstrates mathematical properties of the ""bagging procedure"" (the bagging procedure is central to the random forest algorithm) - in particular, that a collection of individual estimators (e.g. a single decision tree) can approximate any function and provide an upper bound on the error. The idea being, that this generalizes to any function (linear, non-linear, etc.)

Some general questions I had:

A) Is my intuition for 1) and 2) somewhat correct?

B) When it comes to empirical risk minimization for real world applications, is ""leave one out cross validation"" the most accurate (and extremely computationally expensive) representation for the concept of ""generalization error"". As per the wikipedia page on this topic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization_error), I would think that this is true : cross validation is how the generalization error is calculated for machine learning algorithms on real-world data.

C ) When I was reading the literature for the random forest algorithm, it seemed interesting and quite convenient that it is possible to calculate error bounds (i.e. the lowest and maximum possible errors for the random forest on a given set of data). My question: Why is this never done in practice? In all the tutorials, blogs and articles that I have read about the random forest algorithm, no one ever calculated the max/min error bounds for the random forest algorithm given their data. This would seem very convenient - a mathematical formula like this (https://imgur.com/a/LmEIGVT) could be used to determine the error bounds, and then you could use this to see how well your individual classifier performed (e.g. if your classifier provided an accuracy of 61%, but the max possible error for this classifier given the data you have is 65% - these results could be considered more acceptable than otherwise).

Could someone please comment on these?

afp83l,R and how to get started,"Dear Community,

I'm a third (final) year Psychology Bachelor student at a Dutch university and had ample statistical training. However, the program my University used to teach us was SPSS. I learned that R is superior in playing with the data, particularly in visualising it and allowing more complex analyses. In addition, the Research Master Program I will apply to uses R in their courses (They don't assume knowledge, but I enjoy statistics so I want to work ahead). Therefore, I'd like to familiarise myself with R. That means, I'd like to learn how the program works and how to perform common (and later advanced) statistical analyses using R. I had little luck finding decent (free) online tutorials and don't want to buy sth that sucks therefore I decided to ask whether someone here knows of something. If they are not free but reasonably cheap (say 20€) that's fine, too.

Thank you for your time!

a7o413,An online class equivalent to Harvard's Stat 111 - Inference,"Hi, y'all

I'm currently taking - and almost finishing - Harvard's Stat 110 - Probability.

I want to follow up with Harvard's Stat 111 - Inference and I wonder if there's an online option that is free and has the same quality as Harvard's 110. I know it's hard to define quality, but I'm aiming for a well-structured and fairly rigorous treatment of the Inference.

snnsfd,[Q][D][C] The four industry career paths for a Ph.D. in Statistics,"Hello. I am a first year student in a Ph.D. statistics program with plans to enter industry after my degree.

One of my friends in the program is about to complete his dissertation and enter industry at a FAANG company in an ML position, and has been a great source of information for me. He has told me that the following career options exist for me, in decreasing order of selectivity:

1. Quantitative Researcher (Hedge Fund)
2. ML Researcher
3. ML Engineer
4. Data scientist

Based on our discussion, it seems most realistic for me to focus my efforts on making myself marketable as a ML engineer by trying to make solid publications in well-respected ML journals and building a respectable GitHub. However, I would like to gather some further data points first and would greatly appreciate the input of the Statistics community

kxuh73,[Q] Math for Neural Networks: Struggling to me understand the relationship between logistic regression and perceptrons,"**TL;DR:** Logistic regression and perceptrons seem really, really similar at first glance. But the more I think about them mathematically, the former seems all about *projection onto* the linear decision boundary, whereas the latter seem more about *location relative to* the boundary. This seems like a fundamental difference. Either one conception is wrong, or else there’s some equivalence between these conceptions that I’m not seeing.

Please forgive me while I flounder to put my thoughts into words. I want to understand the maths underlying neural networks, and to do so, I'm starting by trying to understand the relationships between the algorithms that came before. But I've hit a wall when trying to see similarities between logistic regression and perceptrons. I'll try to walk you through my thinking.

**First logistic regression (LR).** Studying [the formula](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/lbjN59z65qIGe4LHKb1Wb0_uUTl71C91SSUA3M3AtkoSiVJOLoavPpt6iNu3jH3JlzJA6eABKO6B7cIbOBhvcBnOtmSL6FCmCuf7X3r2n6x1oxoi), LR essentially seems simply like a linear regression passed through a nonlinear sigmoid activation function. The activation function's purpose is to squash the linear regression's range between 0 and 1. This asymptotically bounded range allows us to interpret the LR's output as a probability, namely the probability that the input belongs to the positive class. Because we're just transforming a straight line to a squiggly one, I believe this can be interpreted as projecting the input feature vector onto the linear regression line (just like in linear regression), then compressing the range. *Therefore, in LR, the output is a direct reflection of where the inputs fall ***on the line***.*

**Second, perceptrons.** Zooming out, perceptrons seem pretty much mathematically identical to LR, with one change: the activation function is not a sigmoid, but rather a [step function](https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1*0iOzeMS3s-3LTU9hYH9ryg.png). This means that whereas a LR's output will be a real value ranging continuously between 0 and 1, a perceptron's output is only ever 0 or 1 (or equivalently, -1 or 1), signifying whether the input is (1) or isn't (0, -1) a member of the positive class. Thus, the output of LR and perceptrons are analogous, except that because LR produces a continuous output, it also encodes the ""confidence"" of its classification decision, whereas perceptrons simply give you the decision.

Please stop me here if anything so far is incorrect...

... Assuming that everything has been correct -- specifically regarding the claim that the only difference between LR and perceptrons is the choice of activation function -- then **here is where my thinking breaks down:** Both LR and perceptrons model a kind of [""linear decision boundary"" through the input feature space](https://jermwatt.github.io/machine_learning_refined/mlrefined_images/superlearn_images/Fig_4_1.png). Whenever you see this described geometrically, the explanation is always that the the classifier tries to bisect the space, such that it can classify examples based on which side of the line they fall. This conception then is all about where data points are in relation to that line. But in LR, my understanding is that it's not about which side the point is on, but rather how far along the line that point lies when projected onto it. By contrast, I don't see how ""projection onto the line"" features at all with perceptrons. Perceptrons really do seem to simply ask the question, ""is **x**∙**w** + b > 0?"", and if yes 1, else 0 (where **x**∙**w** + b is the decision boundary).

So fundamentally, I am struggling to understand how ***projection onto*** **the line**, versus ***location on either side of*** **the line**, feature in the mathematics of LR vs. perceptrons. Given that the only thing distinguishing LR and perceptrons is the choice of activation function, it seems like the role of projection onto vs. location relative to the boundary should be the same for both classifiers. But for some reason I cannot intuit this connection.

Any intuition the community can provide here would be most welcome. Thanks for sticking through to the end!

**Edit**: I probably didn't even need to mention neural networks here. The only reason I did so is because, conceptually at least, it seems like neural networks are just a bunch of LRs/perceptrons stacked on top of each other and operating in parallel. Backpropagation aside, these literally seem to be mathematically equivalent. Thus, a deeper understanding of LR and perceptrons should translate directly into a deeper understanding of neural networks. At least, that is my hope.

**Edit 2:** Additionally, support vector machines (SVM) are next on my to-do list. I don’t know much about them yet, but I understand that SVMs are just a type of perceptron. Specifically, perceptrons with the optimal weight vector from the infinite solution set to given feature space’s linear separability constraint, defined by the width of the margin. If that’s correct -- and let me know if it’s not -- then I’ll assume everything you say about perceptrons will also hold for SVMs.",72,24,synthphreak,2021-01-15 13:26:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/kxuh73/q_math_for_neural_networks_struggling_to_me/,0,statistics
kl1vs6,[Q] Probablity Help for a Minecraft Modpack,"Hello there,

I am currently playing the minecraft modpack Gregtech: New Horizons, and in it, there is a machine called the sifter, where you can put in a single item to sift, and you have a chance to get 0 to 9 items out of it from the 9 output slots it has. Each item output is based on a percentage/probablity.

I'm trying to figure out how to find the probablity of getting X amount of items from each sifting operation. Each of the 9 output probabilities are independent of each other, and can't influence each other. This might seem simple to you guys, but I'm not able to wrap my head around how to figure this out.

How would I go about solving my problem?

Edit: A (hopefully) better explanation of the sifting machine and its properties:

> Item A is input into the machine. Machine has 9 output slots with unique, independent probabilities that can't influence another slot. It means that it's possible to have no outputs at all, or have all the slots output an item. Each output slot can **only** output a single item during every operation, meaning that only a max of 9 items can be output each operation.

a0rlo5,Thinking of creating regular stickies to prompt more discussion on the subreddit,"As the title says, I think it would be beneficial to introduce a few regularly occurring stickied posts that cover some of the topics discussed ad nauseam (statistical tests, homework questions, school, career, etc...) and some posts that are interesting in nature. 

Currently my idea is to implement the following stickies: 

+ __Stupid Statistics__ - Every Monday a post is renewed for anybody to ask their statistical questions for the week. This post will include questions ranging from homework help to input on current projects or research (i.e. statistical test questions, data questions, etc..)

+ __College/Career Advice__ - Every Wednesday a new post is created for the week to ask questions about how one should approach career or college decisions. I think it would be nice if people could rate profiles or give information about their program. 

+ __Goof Off Friday__ - Every Friday a new post is created for members to have off-topic conversation in. This can be used for memes, cool stats riddles, cool or interesting code, maybe can even be a ""What are you working on?"" post. 

+ __Domain/Theory Discussion__ - Once a month a new post is written up by a willing member of the community that dives deep into a specific domain or theory of Statistics. This post can include a list of resources or good books on the topic and can stimulate discussion of that specific area of Stats.

I am curious what the community's thoughts are on this. Do you like the names of the posts? What about the timing? Is three stickied posts a week too much (I actually think two is the max number of posts that can be stickied at once)? 

Hopefully this will allow for other members to post more content rich posts and clear up the front page which has started to look like /r/HomeworkHelp recently. 

Please post your thoughts and let's have a civil community discussion about it. 

**Edit:** I like all the input put forth by the community thus far.

""Imagine I ask you about some movie and I ask you to tell me what is the probability that it has explosions in it:

A= Movie has an explosion in it. You would probably take a rough guess at how many movies have explosions in them and how many do not, and then divide the number of movies with explosions by the total number of all movies.

Now, if I were to tell you that this movie was directed by Michael Bay, B = Movie directed by Michael Bay, then you would almost surely update your answer to a probability of 1.""

swfxnp,[Career] How to Learn New Subjects After Grad School,"I’m about to graduate from my MS degree and I have this feeling that I’ve only really scratched the surface of what statistics has to offer. I’m really curious to learn about topics I didn’t get to cover in school. 

Question for working professionals - what do you think is the best way to learn new subjects on your own? Note that my question has more to do with things that might be hard to learn on your own (things they would teach in a class like how to do Bayesian data analysis) as opposed to things that might be easier to learn on your own (like how to use a specific R package).

There are “modern classic” textbooks in most of the subjects I’m interested in like Gelman’s Bayesian Data Analysis or Hyndman’s Time series book. Is my best bet just picking up these books and working through them in my free time? Other options might be Coursera, Udemy, MIT OCW. I just want to make sure the material is aimed at statisticians and not for a more general audience. 

How do you approach self-study? Do you only learn things if it would help you in your job? How often do you spend time learning?

rewlsn,"[D] Perhaps Leo Brieman was not right in his criticism about 'Data Models' in his famous paper ""Statistical Modeling : The two cultures""","Often the Auto ML or low code Data science library creators take refuge in the famous Leo Brieman's paper ""Statistical Modeling : The two cultures"". In it, he argues that statistician's fixation with Data models has led to :

*  Led to irrelevant theory and questionable scientific conclusions
*  Kept statisticians from using more suitable algorithmic models 
*  Prevented statisticians from working on exciting new problems 

In his famous paper Leo Brieman gives an impression that Prediction is everything or as I infer it, one should just worry about predictive accuracy and perhaps one should not waste too much time trying to understand the Data generating process.

Fast forward 21 yrs, we find ourselves with cases like Zillow and other umpteen cases of Data science project failures where the goal was simply to "" find an algorithm f(x) such that for future x in a test set, f(x) will be a good predictor of y. 

I feel the mere fixation of trying to find the algorithm f(x) leads to people not focusing on the 'how' and 'Why' questions. The questions 'how' and 'why' are only asked post fact i.e. when the models fail miserably on the ground.

Given this background, don't you think Leo Brieman was wrong in his criticism about 'Data models'?

nie3j6,[Q] Hedging against criticism and misunderstandings when presenting statistical work to non-technical or ill-informed audiences.,"So I just had a work-related thought. For technical analysts, it is quite often that the work is presented towards an audience that has a non-technical background. Or even worse, an audience with some technical knowledge but still has misunderstood essential ideas and concepts. In such settings, it could be quite challenging to present and defend the work you have done if you do not have the respect of the audience.

Take this hypothetical scenario as an example; a statistician or economist presents a forecast from a model where the forecast is later shown to be off the realized target to some degree. From a statistical perspective, it is natural that a prediction will be off, given that it is unreasonable to expect a model to be entirely deterministic due to the stochastic nature of the problem. However, a non-technical audience might interpret such a scenario as the forecast being bad due to a flawed model and might then assume you do not know what you are doing.

How would you position yourself to avoid this in a practical context? I think it might be reasonable to present prediction intervals and a benchmark that the audience can understand to hedge against this problem. Then you could intuitively present uncertainty while showing that the model outperforms something that the audience might be thinking of using. I am curious if anyone else has given this scenario a thought or possible have relevant experience?",70,27,asymmetricloss,2021-05-22 08:32:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/nie3j6/q_hedging_against_criticism_and_misunderstandings/,0,statistics

kaial7,"[Q] Why isn't it considered ""cheating"" when we use random effects in a Bayesian model, because random effects models effectively use the data to create a prior (i.e., adaptive prior)?","Hey stats gang!

I'm in a grad-level Bayesian Statistics course, and we're following Richard McElreath's ""Statistical Rethinking"" book (excellent book by the way). At the beginning of the book when we first get introduced to priors, we're essentially told that we should not create priors based on the data; that is, creating our model based on our data is effectively ""cheating"", and our priors should be uninformative or based on prior knowledge (which makes sense, that's really the essence of the prior).

Now, when we are considering Chapter 13, the multi-level models, we are introduced to these adaptive priors or hyperpriors, that effectively use the data to create a prior. So the question is, how is that not ""cheating"", because it's essentially using data to create the priors? I obviously get the reasoning behind using these hyperparameters, it makes sense. But I can't come up with good reasoning why it's not ""cheating"".

I feel that I have gotten to the point where if I apply the same sense of skepticism that I do to my work to politics, I end up with the conclusion there is not enough data to 'pick a side'.  And of course if I do not apply the same amount of skepticism that I do to my work I would feel that I am living my life in willful ignorance.  This also leads to the problem where there isn't enough time in the day to research every topic to the degree that I believe would be sufficient enough to draw a strong enough of a conclusion.

Sure there are certain issues like climate change where there is already a decent scientific consensus, but I do not believe that the majority of the issues are that clear-cut.

6a72ke,Changes to /r/Statistics,"Hello everyone, the mod team has gotten together and have talked about making some changes to the subreddit. About a week ago there was a post bringing attention to the current state of moderation. We have decided to try and move the sub in a direction to foster more of a community. We also want your input, because ultimately the community members is what makes the gears turn. 

1. **We have decided to change to a flair based system.** We hope to stimulate more focused discussion by allowing you guys to flair your posts. Here is the current running list for possible flairs:

        Article/Research
        Career/College Advice
        Statistics Question
        Software
        Other
        Meta
    Blatant homework posts and posts that can't [ask a good statistics question](http://www.statisticalanalysisconsulting.com/how-to-ask-a-statistics-question/) will be removed and directed to more appropriate subreddits. We want to open up to more questions but keep them at a high level of discussion. 

2. **We also are planning on updating the sidebar with fresh links.** Perhaps we can have a stickied College/Career advice post that we can point towards new comers. If you have anything that you think would be helpful in the sidebar please link. 

3. **Cutdown on self promotion and pointless links.** There has been a spree of people posting questionable material and links to their own personal website too much. People should be able to link to OC but it cannot be blatant or excessive. Also, we do our best to block spam but it looks rather suspicious when a user just posts a link with no discussion but yet they are an active user on other subreddits. As members please be on the lookout and report this kind of activity. 

As of right now a new CSS style is in the works but given the current issue with Reddit's changes it might not be done in time. Let's make this community an online benchmark and please leave your thoughts below!

yhf0fw,[Q] What is wrong with interpreting a Bayesian probability from a Frequentist CI?,"I  know the interpretation for a Frequentist 95% CI is that if we were to  construct infinitely many similarly constructed intervals, 95% of them  would contain the true population value.

Generally,  many people (""wrongly"") say that if they generate a 95% CI of (5,10)  that there is a 95% chance that the population value is between 5 and  10. But how is this wrong? There is a large X number of possible CI's of  size n, 95% of which contain the true value, and this is one out of the  X intervals, so there is a 95% chance that it is one of the intervals  that contains the true value. And if that is the case, there is a 95%  chance that it contains the true value.

Now,  what I have also heard is people will say that by doing this I'm  interpreting a Frequentist construct with a Bayesian probability.  Because to the Frequentists, it doesn't make sense to talk about the  probability of whether this contains the true value or not, \*it does or  it doesn't\*. But what is wrong with saying ""I've created this Frequentist 95% CI, (5,10), so there is a 95% chance (from Bayesian definition of probability rather than Frequentist) that the true population value is between 5 and 10.""",70,69,blimp456,2022-10-30 14:00:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/yhf0fw/q_what_is_wrong_with_interpreting_a_bayesian/,0,statistics

m6e42b,Open [Discussion] on COVID vaccine and blood clots,"Apparently, 40 people in Europe out of 17 million got leg and lung blood clots after having a COVID vaccine, and some people are concerned.

I looked up the rate of blood clots, and the CDC says that it’s about 1-2 people per 1000 per year for general blood clots. Let’s assume that leg and lung clots make up the majority of these. To simplify, lets conservatively say that there’s a 1 in a thousand chance anyone will get a blood clot in a year’s time. Then on average, you would expect to see 1/1000/12\*3\*17000000 = 4250 cases in a three month period.

Either my math is wrong, the source data is wrong, or people are freaking out over VERY SAFE looking data (4000 >> 40). The article does specify that the 37 cases number is specifically for leg and lung clots, so maybe that skews it a bit, but this difference seems crazy to me as I would expect most clots to form in legs and lungs. Am I the crazy one here?

Edit: I see that I have left a lot of information out of the problem. As others have correctly pointed out, I failed to take into account who was affected, the type of clot, and the timing on when people started getting affected. There still doesn’t seem to be any cause for panic though.

jgauhs,"[D] Frequentist vs Bayes (not actually a ""what's better"" thing, but a hypothetical)"," I've  had this thought for a while, and batted it around with others - I  thought I'd see if there was interest here for a discussion.

Frequentist  methods are often maligned, as they often lead down the path of pvalues  being used naively and misinterpreted confidence intervals. I get it,  for sure. Those statistics can be lazy ways to analyze data and are  often interpreted wrong anyway.  Baysian methods are often help up as a  better, more intuitive way of doing things - so less prone to bad  interpretations.  (Leaving aside the fact that one often ends up in  similar places if doing things properly.)

But  frequentist methods were widely adopted first, and are certainly more  generally used and taught.  So it's unsurprising we get a lot of  problems, kinda like how the dominant operating systems are the ones  targeted by malware.

So the  hypothetical - Do you think we would have the same problem if, in a  hypothetical world, Baysian stats were the methodology more widely  taught and more widely used for the last 100 years, and be saying that  Frequentist methods are a better, more objective, more X way of doing  things (assuming it was just coming into vogue in the last few decades)?

In  other words, is the interpretation problem we all lament re: p-values  and the rest really fundamental or just a result of teaching a ton of  people with sketchy math backgrounds a little bit of stats in undergrad,  and the same problems would emerge if different paradigms were  dominant?

(I tend to think there  are some real fundamental challenges of interpretation, but a lot of the  misapplication concerns re: p-values and the like comes from sheer  volume of researchers working with only basic stats and would likely  arise even if other methods were taught - people are lazy and would just  define some threshold from any new method and that would summarily be  abused. But I can be convinced otherwise).",72,56,thuja_plicata,2020-10-22 23:05:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/jgauhs/d_frequentist_vs_bayes_not_actually_a_whats/,0,statistics

16m4h4f,[R] I used Bayesian statistics to find the best dispensers for every Zonai device in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,"Hello!  
I thought people in this statistics subreddit might be interested in how I went about inferring Zonai device draw chances for each dispenser in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.  
In this Switch game there are devices that can be glued together to create different machines. For instance, you can make a snowmobile from a fan, sled, and steering stick.  
There are dispensers that dispense 3-6 of about 30 or so possible devices when you feed it a construct horn (dropped by defeated robot enemies) or a regular (also dropped from defeated enemies) or large Zonai charge (Found in certain chests, dropped by certain boss enemies, obtained from completing certain challenges, etc).  
The question I had was: if I want to spend the least resources to get the most of a certain Zonai device what dispenser should I visit?  
I went to every dispenser, saved my game, put in the maximum (60) device yielding combination (5 large Zonai charges), and counted the number of each device, and reloaded my game, repeating this 10 times for each dispenser.  
I then calculated analytical Beta marginal posterior distributions for each device, assuming a flat Dirichlet prior and multinomial likelihood. These marginal distributions represent the range of probabilities of drawing that particular device from that dispenser consistent with the count data I collected.  
Once I had these marginal posteriors I learned how to graph them using svg html tags and a little javascript so that, upon clicking on a dispenser's curve within a devices graph, that curve is highlighted and a link to the map location of the dispenser on ZeldaDungeon.net appears. Additionally, that dispenser's curves for the other items it dispenses are highlighted in those item's graphs.  
It took me a while to land on the analytical marginal solution because I had only done gridded solutions with multinomial likelihoods before and was unaware that this had been solved. Once I started focusing on dispensers with 5 or more potential items my first inclination was to use Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, which I coded from scratch. Tuning the number of iterations and proposal width was a bit finicky, especially for the 6 item dispenser, and I was worried it would take too long to get through all of the data. After a lot of Googling I found out about the Dirichlet compound multinomial distribution (DCM) and it's analytical solution!  
Anyways, I've learned a lot about different areas of Bayesian inference, MCMC, a tiny amount of javascript, and inline svg.   
Hope you enjoyed the write up!

ta7mpx,[E] Mathematical statistics is frustrating me,"Hello guys,

&#x200B;

During my bachelor's I studied mathematical statistics with applications by Wackerly et al. and I was fairly confident that I have grasped many of the important concepts of statistics. But right now as I recently started a master's program in statistics, I am again studying mathematical statistics but with Statistical Inference by Casella and quite frankly I feel like I am back to zero. Well, not exactly zero but what's really bothering me is my ability to understand and derive some proofs of the theorems.

&#x200B;

I don't really have a solid math background and I always regretted that I didn't take math too seriously early on. I mean I can do calculus and I am actually quite good at solving applied statistics problems like deriving MLEs or deriving some probability distribution, things like that. But I never liked proving theorems and honestly I have no idea where to start to get better at those things. You know, now that I am in my master's.. I feel like I should definitely be better at those things.. And I even heard people saying that Casella's is like the most basic one so I feel even worse about myself..

&#x200B;

The thing is, it feels like trying to improve my math now seems not so great of an investment considering that I am looking for employment after I finish my master's. I mean wouldn't I be better prepared for jobs by spending more time programming and doing some projects?

&#x200B;

Does anybody have any advice or have similar experience struggling with math stats and how that affected your career perhaps?

s73sdc,[Q] Is there any statistical justification for Elon Musk's new tweet?,"Greetings, all! I am by no means a statistician, but the few stats classes that I have taken have given me no statistical justification for Elon's most recent tweet about population occupancy. I'll link the specific tweet at the end, but in summary, he claims that current UN projections of population expectancy are *""nonsense""* and they need to *""Just multiply last year’s births by life expectancy. Given downward trend in birth rate, that is best case unless reversed.""* 

To me, this is utter nonsense for two reasons. First and foremost, a data set including multiple years could yield average births per mother for any given year in the set. Could we not then just compare the averages within the set and inferentially conclude the expected average births per mother for the next year (at the very least)? This seems like a much stronger predictor of population occupancy than just a single year's birth rate multiplied by the current life expectancy. Wouldn't Musk's method just show us the expected population occupancy for the average life duration of only last year's newborns?   What exactly does he mean by *""Given downward trend in birth rate, that is best case unless reversed.""*

Second, I think is it safe to assume that there will not be a linear downward trend in birthrates given that couples are generally in closer proximity to each other during COVID lockdowns and thus the average births for the next few years are likely to increase. I may be wrong in this conclusion, but to me, it seems that Musk's method relies solely on the assumption that births will necessarily decline in the coming years. 

It's not that I think Elon Musk is necessarily wrong in his overall opinion on the need for more children; however, I do think we should sometimes question Elon when it comes to some of his philosophy and er, well, logic and so I came to this subreddit in the hope of finding some sort of meaning to his reasoning. Sorry if this type of question isn't allowed here.

rxnyr0,[Question] Is my university tutor misunderstanding basic statistics? Or am I? (Not homework),"\*\*Message to the mods - This is not homework. The assignment was submitted and graded weeks ago - this is just follow-up for my own knowledge/sanity\*\*  


This has been bothering me quite a lot, and despite many attempts to clarify this with the module tutor, I'm not getting anywhere. He's sticking to his guns.   
I've asked a handful of Physics PhD students who all agree that my method/answer makes more sense.   
The field is biology/psychology, just fyi.   
The question and data are together \[here\]([https://imgur.com/zxqK4fC](https://imgur.com/zxqK4fC)) . I'll restate them below as well. 

The questions asks ""**Is there any evidence for a change in autism prevalence rates in children aged 8 between the years 2004-2009**"". 

  
Prevalence is defined as the fraction of the population with a given condition.   
For example, if there are 1000 children aged 8 with autism at a given time, out of a population of 1,000,000 children aged 8, the prevalence is simply 1000/1,000,000 = 0.001 = 0.1%.   


The **relevant data points** are the **prevalence rates in 2004 and 2009, given as 0.22% and 0.25% respectively**. 

The question is deliberately vague about what constitutes ""evidence"" - we're not looking for a rigorous definition of evidence or any claims of statistical significance.   
The tutor said that here, ""evidence"" can also be read as ""indication"" - so, ""**Is there any indication for a change in autism prevalence rates in children aged 8 between the years 2004-2009**"".   


So here goes:   
**My method/reasoning:**  
\-The prevalence increases from 0.22% to 0.25%.   
This is a 13.6% increase, given by ((0.25-0.22) / 0.22) = 13.6%.   
This is clearly significant, and definitely ""indicates"" there was a change in prevalence rates.   


**My tutor's method/reasoning:**  
\-The prevalence increases from 0.22% to 0.25%.   
This is a  0.25%-0.22% = 0.03% difference, which is clearly insignificant.   
""This only increases slightly, and consequently shows no evidence"", to quote my tutor.   
\-He has also said ""The question therefore asks you to identify the percentages 0.22% and 0.25%, and simply take one from the other to identify the difference""

**I would like your humble opinions on how you would answer this question - as a community of statistics fans. I know it's basic, I just need an informed outsider's opinion.**   
I'll also add some of my thoughts on both methods below. 

**Some further elaboration:**  
In some back-and-forth emails, I gave my tutor the following example - I believe this explains my point clearly, and demonstrates that my method and conclusion make sense, whereas his method breaks down. 

"" Imagine a new disease exists, and on one day there are 791 cases, which is a 0.00001% global prevalence.   
The next day, there are 7910 cases, which is a global prevalence of 0.0001%. 

By my tutor's logic, there is only a slight increase in prevalence, by 0.00009%, a 'small number', so this isn't significant. 

By my logic, you compare the two prevalence rates and see that the number of cases has multiplied by ten, i.e a 900%, increase, which is clearly significant, and the disease is spreading quickly.""",69,98,elmo_touches_me,2022-01-06 20:21:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/rxnyr0/question_is_my_university_tutor_misunderstanding/,0,statistics

ilr822,"[Q] Non-parametric models, overhyped?","I’m curious what others’ thoughts and experiences are about ML in the “data science” realm. In grad school, I focused mainly on ML. Object detection, natural language processing, etc. It all sounded like “the future”. And with products like Alexa that can converse with you/detect commands from speech, self-driving cars, etc., this is definitely an exciting time for ML.

I’ve just started my first job out of grad school as a data scientist and 100% of what I do uses Bayesian statistics. We care as much about our confidence in our model’s predictions as we do about the predictions, themselves.

In school I came to think that neural nets, random forests, etc were super awesome. But now I’m taking a step back and thinking, if you make decisions based on a model, being able to quantify your certainty is very important. I’m starting to think that high variance, non-parametric models can be very accurate, but how they arrive at their decisions can be too abstract to be practically useful. And I’m starting to think that their popularity isn’t a good indicator of how useful they are.

Data were simulated (pretty much arbitrarily) to make a somewhat interesting shape that still looked kinda linear. Everything was done with the ggplot2 and animation packages in R.

**Edit (Source Code):**

Please let me know if you know a better way of doing something than I've done, I'm still learning!

65tqka,I calculated the probability and time it would take for a monkey to randomly type out the Complete Works of Shakespeare,"""Given infinite time, a monkey could randomly type out the Complete Works of Shakespeare.""

I'm going to assume our monkey types 100 characters a minute.

There are 3,695,990 characters in Shakespeare's Complete Works, and I'm going to account for 34 possible characters being our alphabet, periods, commas, colons, semicolons, question marks, exclamation points, apostrophes and spaces. Hopefully I didn't miss anything. 

To type this many characters it would take our monkey 26.666 days.

(1/34)^3695990 = 1.727 x 10^-5660331. 

1/(1.727 x 10^-5660331) is the chance of our monkey typing all 3,695,990 characters in the right order. 

This would result in 5.789 x 10^5660330 attempts to achieve success.

26.666 x (5.789 x 10^5660330) = 1.505 x 10^5660332 days.

1.505 x 10^5660332 days/365.24 = 4.1206 x 10^5660329 years. 

The universe is 13.73 billion years old. 

To put that into perspective, if I divide this number by 13.73 billion we are still left with 3.00 x 5660319 years. 

To put THAT into perspective, this number would have 5660320 digits. It would take 1887 pages (at 3000 characters a page) just to write this number down. 

**For a monkey to randomly type the Complete Works of Shakespeare, it would take 4.1206 x 10^5660329 years, or the age of our universe multiplied by a number so big it would take nearly 2000 pages to write down.**",67,33,None,2017-04-17 05:17:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/65tqka/i_calculated_the_probability_and_time_it_would/,0,statistics

l3gjqp,[D] Confusion Surrounding the Multivariate Normal Distribution,"I am trying to teach myself about the multivariate normal distribution and I am struggling to understand some basic things about it.

To show my confusion, I use the famous Iris Flower dataset (I will use the R programming language for some basic scripts). The Iris Flower dataset has 5 columns and 150 rows. Each row contains the measurements for an individual flower (i.e. there are 150 flowers). The columns contain the  measurements of the ""Petal Width"", the ""Petal Length"", the ""Sepal Length"" , the ""Sepal Width"" and the ""Type of Flower"" (three types of flowers, categorical variable).

Suppose I Just take the Petal Length variable. I want to see if the Petal Length follows a (univariate) normal distribution. I think this can be easily done using different strategies (R code below):

    #load the iris data and isolate the petal length
     data(iris) 
    var1 = iris$Petal.Length 
    
     #visually check if the distribution of the petal length looks like a ""bell curve"" plot(density(var1)) 
    
     #look at the quantile-quantile
     plot qqnorm(var1)  
    
    #use statistics (e.g. the shapiro-wilks test) to check for normality  
    shapiro.test(var1)
    
    #if the data is normally distributed, we can find out the mean and the variance
    mean(var1)
    var(var1)

Similarly, I can repeat this for the remaining variables in the iris data. However, this task becomes a lot more complicated when you consider the multivariate distribution of the iris data : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate\_normal\_distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution) . When dealing with the multivariate distribution, there is now a ""vector of means"" and a ""variance-covariance matrix"". This means that there are more complex relationships within the data - some parts of the data might have a normal distribution whereas some parts of the data might not be normally distributed. 

After spending some time researching how to determine if a dataset follows a multivariate distribution , I found out about something called the Mardia test, which apparently uses the ""skewness"" and the ""kurtosis""  to determine if the data is normally distributed (high skewness and high kurtosis means the data is not normally distributed). I tried running the following code in R to perform the Marida test on the iris data:

     data = iris[,-5] 
    result = mvn(data) 
    result

The results of this are confusing. I am not sure if I am approaching this problem in the right way. My question: How do you determine if the data you are dealing with has a multivariate normal distribution? 

My ultimate goal is to determine if the data follows a multivariate normal distribution for the purpose of outlier detection. I found out about something called the Mahalanobis Distance : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis\_distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance) 

If my data does follow a multivariate normal distribution, i.e. suppose (given the data) I evaluate the mean vector and the variance-covariance matrix of the data - I can use the Mahalanobis distance to find out which data points are situated further away from the center of the multivariate-normal distribution. The further the point is, the more of an outlier the point is.

Another idea I had - perhaps the distribution of more complicated data can be approximated by ""combining"" several (multivariate) normal distributions together ([https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html#:\~:text=A%20Gaussian%20mixture%20model%20is,Gaussian%20distributions%20with%20unknown%20parameters](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html#:~:text=A%20Gaussian%20mixture%20model%20is,Gaussian%20distributions%20with%20unknown%20parameters).) . Therefore, I could try to determine the irregular distribution of my data by combining (i.e. ""mixing"") several different normal distributions together (note: I am not sure if the resulting combination of these mixtures will necessarily have to be normally distributed?). Then, I could use the Mahalanobis distance to measure how far each point is situated from the center of the combined distribution - again, points that are further away from the center of the combined distribution are more likely to be outliers. Is this approach mathematically correct?

Can someone please help me in clarifying these details about finding out the distribution of multivariate data?

atw23i,The P-value - Criticism and Alternatives (Bayes Factor and Magnitude-Based Inference),"Blog mirror with MBI diagram: https://www.stats-et-al.com/2019/02/alternatives-to-p-value.html

Seminal 2006 paper on MBI (no paywall): https://tees.openrepository.com/tees/bitstream/10149/58195/5/58195.pdf

Previous article - Degrees of Freedom explained: https://www.stats-et-al.com/2018/12/degrees-of-freedom-explained.html

## **The Problems with P-Value**

First what is the p-value, and why do people hate it? P-value refers to the probability of obtaining at least as extreme evidence against your current null hypothesis if that null hypothesis is actually true.

There are some complications with the definition. First, “as extreme” needs to be further clarified with a one-sided or two-sided alternative hypothesis. Another issue comes from the fact that you're dealing with a hypothesis as if it’s already true. If the parameter comes from a continuous distribution, the chance of it being any given value is zero, so we’re assuming something that is impossible by definition. If we are hypothesizing about a continuous variable parameter, the hypothesis could be false by some trivial amount that would take an extremely large sample to find.

P-values also convey little information on their own. When used to describe effects or differences, they can only really reveal if some effect can be detected. We use terms like statistically significant to describe this detectability, which makes the problem more confusing. The word ‘significant’ sounds like the effect it should be meaningful in real world terms; it isn’t. 

P-value is sometimes used as an automatic tool to decide if something is publication worthy (this is not as pervasive as it was even ten years ago, but it still happens).  There’s also undue reverence from the threshold of 0.05. If a p-value is less than 0.05, even by a little, then it the effect or difference it describes is (sometimes) seen as much more important than if the p-value were even a little greater than 0.05. There is no meaningful difference between p-values of 0.049 and 0.051, but using default methods, the smaller p-value leads to a conclusion where an effect is ‘significant’, where the larger p-value does not. Adapting to this reverence to the 0.05, some researchers make small adjustments to their analysis when a p-value is slightly above 0.05 in order to try and push it below that threshold artificially. This practice is called p-hacking.

So, we have an unintuitive, but very general, statistical method that gets overused by one group and reviled by another. These two groups aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.

The general-purpose feature is p-values is fantastic though, it’s hard to beat a p-value for appropriateness in varied situations. p-values aren’t bad, they’re just misunderstood. They’re also not alone.



## **Confidence intervals.**

Confidence intervals are ranges that are assumed to contain the true parameter value somewhere within them with a fixed probability. In many cases confidence intervals are computed alongside p-value by default. A hypothesis test can be conducted by checking if the confidence interval includes the null hypothesis value for the parameter. If we were looking for a difference between two means the null hypothesis would be that the mean is 0 and we would check if the confidence interval includes 0. If we were looking for a difference in odds we could get a confidence interval of the odds ratio and see if that includes one.

There are two big advantages to confidence intervals over p-values. First, they explicitly state the parameter being estimated. If we're estimating a difference of means, the confidence interval will also be measured in terms of a difference. If we're estimating a slope effect in linear regression model, the confidence interval will give the probable bounds of that slope effect.

The other, related, advantage is that confidence intervals imply the magnitude of the effect. Not only can we see if a given slope or difference is plausibly zero given the data, but we can get a sense of how far from zero the plausible values reach.

Furthermore, confidence intervals expand nicely into two-dimensional situations with confidence bands, and into multi-dimensional situations with confidence regions. There are Bayesian analogues called credible intervals and credible regions, which have a similar end results to confidence intervals / regions, but different mathematical interpretations.


## **Bayes factors.**

Bayes factors are used to compare pairs of hypotheses.
For simplicity let’s call these the alternative and null respectively. If the Bayes factor of an alternative hypothesis is 3, that implies that the alternative is three times as likely as the null hypothesis given the data. 

The simplest implementation of Bayes factor is between two hypotheses that are both at some fixed value, like a difference of means of 5 versus a difference of 0, or a slope coefficient of 3 versus a slope of 0. However, we can also the alternative hypothesis value to our best (e.g. maximum likelihood, or least squares) estimate of that value. In this case the Bayes factor is never less than 1, and it increases but naturally as we move further away from the null hypothesis value. For these situations we typically use the log Bayes Factor instead.

As with p-values, we can set thresholds for rejecting a null hypothesis. For example, we may use the informal definition of a Bayes factor of 10 as strong evidence towards the alternative hypothesis, and reject any null hypotheses for tests that produce a Bayes factor of 10 or greater. This has the advantage over p-values of giving a more concrete interpretation of one thing as more likely than another, instead of relying on the assumption that the null is true. Furthermore, greater evidence of significance produces a larger Bayes factor, which makes it more intuitive for people expecting a large number for strong evidence. In programming languages like R, computing Bayes factor is nearly as simple as p-values, albeit more computationally intense.


## **Magnitude based inference**

Magnitude based inference (MBI) operates a lot like confidence intervals except that it also incorporates information about biologically significant effects. Magnitude based inference requires a confidence interval (generated in the usual ways) and two researcher-defined thresholds: one above and one below the null hypothesis value. MBI was developed for physiology and medicine, so these thresholds are usually referred to as the beneficial and detrimental thresholds, respectively. 

If we only had a null hypothesis value and a confidence interval we could make one of three inferences based on this information: The parameter being estimated is less than the null hypothesis value,: Is more than the null hypothesis value, or it is uncertain. These correspond to the confidence interval being entirely below the null hypothesis value, entirely above the null hypothesis value, and straddling the value respectively.

With these two additional thresholds, we can make a greater range of inferences. For example,

If a confidence interval is entirely beyond the beneficial threshold, then we can say with some confidence is beneficial. 

If the confidence interval is entirely above the null hypothesis value, but includes the beneficial threshold, we can say with confidence that the effect is real and non-detrimental, and that it may be beneficial. 

If a confidence interval includes the null hypothesis value but no other threshold, we can say with some confidence that the effect is trivial. In other words, we don't know what the value is but we're reasonably sure that it isn't large enough to matter.

MBI offers much greater Insight than a p-value or a confidence interval alone, but it does require some additional expertise from outside of statistics in order to determine what is a minimum beneficial effect or a minimum detrimental effect. Sometimes thresholds involve guesswork, and often involve research discretion, so it also opens up a new avenue for p-hacking. However, as long as the thresholds are transparent, it’s easy to readers to check work for themselves.",69,76,factotumjack,2019-02-23 14:34:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/atw23i/the_pvalue_criticism_and_alternatives_bayes/,0,statistics

jeog88,[D] The correct interpretation of Confidence Intervals.,"My stats teacher has explained that the correct definition of CIs is ""With frequent repetition of sampling, in the long run 95% of the calculated confidence intervals include correct results, i.e. the true unknown population parameter.""  

He has explicitly pointed out that interpreting them as ""The confidence interval [x, y] contains the actual population mean with a probability of 95%"" are *not* correct.

kqf5xt,[Q] I have a distribution of standard deviations which seems like two combined distributions. What is the most appropriate way to separate them/draw a cutoff?,"Not a statistician here, so I'm hoping to get some help from this sub.

I am working with methylation data and have calculated the standard deviation of all my samples. The result looks like this: [https://i.imgur.com/MFoJJ8F.png](https://i.imgur.com/MFoJJ8F.png)

I've been told that we are likely going to be discarding everything under a value of 0.1 standard deviations - the explanation was based on looking at this distribution. I've been tasked with coming up with a way to scientifically determine 0.1, rather than just say ""we eyeballed it"".

Do you have any tips on **methods** to go about this? I appreciate any references on mixed models or theory that I can read about, but I'm specifically looking for *how* to go about this. I'm using the R framework. My hope is that I can apply some method to my other distributions that look like this (and the division does not fall on the 0.1 mark).

Or - is this just one of those things that statisticians 'eyeball' on a case-by-case basis?

Thanks!

**EDIT:** Thanks for the comments coming in so quickly! Following [this](https://tinyheero.github.io/2016/01/03/gmm-em.html) post from Fong Chun Chan's blog, I was able to use a Gaussian Mixed model to successfully isolate the two distributions.

Whether that's a result of being (at the time) inexperienced, and realising with hindsight. Or perhaps it's a result of working in an environment with unreasonable constraints that forced you to use approaches that you disagreed with. 

The reason for this post is that whilst learning everything is quite clean, everything has pretty definite parameters and goals. I'm sure this isn't the case in general, and perhaps answers here may provide some insight into examples of that.

100xaaw,[D] It took me a really long time to feel comfortable with random variables. Did you experience the same thing?,"It really took me a long time to (partially) get out of this shithole. The more I thought about it, the more I needed a bullet to my head and the less the reality made sense. That is why I told my friends that they should never think too much about measure-theoretic stuff (just ignore the course if it is possible). Learning measure theoretic probability theory may do more harm than good as it changes the way you see the reality, and you may get trapped there for a while.

These misconceptions and crises occured chronologically.

* My first misconception: a (real-valued) random variable is something abstract that produces random numbers. (I think this misconception is still a very useful simplification, and it should be enough to understand statistics intuitively)

*It is indeed a misconception. A random variable is a measurable function from a probability space (Ω, Σ, P) to (R, B(R)). It is neither* ***a variable*** *nor* ***random.*** 

* It led to my second misconception: A random variable is random, but the abstract object (Ω, Σ, P) will produce something random, and it makes the random variable produce something random.

*Well, that's the way some people introduced the concept of random variables to students, but again, there is nothing random about the probability space (Ω, Σ, P). There is no celestial being represented by the triplet (Ω, Σ, P) that produces random  ω in Ω which will be mapped to a real number through a random variable.*

* My first crisis: Nothing about random variables is random, so does it even make sense to think about the reality from this perspective? Do all the theorems that I proved in probability courses (e.g. CLT, (w/s) law of large numebers) even make sense in reality? How do I know that other complicated things that I proved are useful (or useless).

*During this period, I suddenly felt like I was stupid, and I could not prove any theorems because all I had in my head was the intrusive thought ""It does not make sense at all"".*

* My second crisis: What does it mean by saying ""simulating (pseudo-)random numbers from i.i.d random variables"" if random variables are not random. How do we know that random numbers we simulate are random (even if the validity of the methods such as Accept-Reject, MCMC, is formally proved)?

*It was a serious crisis because my field was Computational Statistics.*

* My latest savior: Probability theory is just a model of the reality, and it is constructed (starting from Kolmogorov's axioms of probability) as other branches of mathematics. We should not confuse it with the reality,. Everything about random variables is just about measurability of ""volume of something"", and by saying ""volume of something"", I mean the probability (or the likelihood) that something happens. That is why even if the concept of random variables and probability is intrinsically not random, but they are still useful, and all the theorems I proved still makes sense.

*We always try to measure the volume of something in statistics.* *For example, for n i.i.d. random variables distributed according to Z-distribution, we can measure the volume of any interval (a, b) which is P(a < Z <b), and law of large numbers tell us how the volume is concentrated for the sample mean as n goes to infinity. Surely, we do not need ""random variables"" to be random for this concept to be useful.*

* The journey has not ended yet. I still have some questions on the problem of non-measurable subsets.

Last but not least, eventually I really understand why measure theory is called measure theory.",63,22,itedelweiss,2023-01-01 23:47:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/100xaaw/d_it_took_me_a_really_long_time_to_feel/,0,statistics

vztbm8,[Q] Will pursuing a PhD in statistics potentially ruin my passion for statistics?,"Hello smart people,

I am nearing the end of my masters in statistics. It has been hard as I work full time, but I am just as obsessed, if not more obsessed, with statistics more than ever. 

Some professors have suggested I consider a PhD in statistics, biostat, or IE. I would agree it seems to be ideal in terms of my interest, but I feel it is not the best idea. 

I work full time as an industrial engineer ATM, and am planning on switching to a data science role.

Would it be reasonable to think doing a PhD will rob me of potential earnings? (I will undoubtedly take a pay cut of some sorts)

I also hear it is gruelling and an unforgiving process to get a PhD, and at the end of the day, there's no guarantee you will complete your dissertation. I feel this process could potentially drain my current interests if things don't work well. I already almost have a masters, so it won't necessarily give me an additional degree if I drop out.

I never had a whole course only in statistics. I self-learned some parts of statistics. However, I feel I only have an intuition about the field, but I feel very uncertain about many concepts.

The package supports a wide range of response distributions and modeling options such as splines, autocorrelation, and censoring all in a multilevel context. A lot of post-processing and plotting methods are implemented as well. Some examples from Psychology and Medicine will be discussed.

olqhzg,[D] Research Papers with Statistical Errors in them,"Hi all,

* Underpowered hypothesis tests
* Lack of correction for multiple comparisons
* Biased Sampling
* Mispecified Models
* Poor/absent randomization/blocking. 
* Unmet model assumptions 
* Unnecessary splitting/binning.

nl66m9,"[D] Why is ""convolution"" a meaningful mathematical operation?","I was watching an introductory video on convolutional neural networks, and the ""convolution"" operation itself seems so interesting. It seems that convolutional neural networks take a picture, and via convolutional layers, repeatedly shrink the original picture to a small matrix of numbers. This small matrix of number is associated with a ""label"" (e.g. ""dog"" or ""cat""), and then the neural network can learn to recognize similar pictures.

I had the following questions:

Question 1: Why is the ""convolution process"" a meaningful operation? How are convolutions able to capture and filter meaningful information from pictures? I know I am wrong, but from a layman's perspective, the convolution process (i.e. taking the algebraic dot product between filter weights and the pixel values of a picture) seems somewhat ""arbitrary"". I just find it very interesting that the dot product between these two entities is able to capture and filter meaningful information about the pictures. Just a guess : does this have to do with the ""universal approximation theorem""? i.e. the universal approximation theorem also applies to cnn's.

Question 2: I have often heard claims about neural network based approaches being intended for ""non-tabular"" data, such as pictures. The argument being, neural networks work better when there is a higher level of ""richness"" within the data, e.g. pictures containing 786 pixels and each of these pixels usually being non-empty. This is usually contrasted with ""tabular data"" such as data that can be easily placed into Excel spreadsheets (e.g. typical of finance data). Apparently, tabular data is more prone to containing less informative data compared to pictures, potentially making the performance of neural networks worse. When dealing with tabular data, it is said that boosting and bagging based techniques (e.g. random forest) are more likely to yield stronger results.

I was just wondering: Why aren't pictures normally considered as tabular data? Couldn't you just take the individual pixel values and collectively store them into matrices (i.e. tabular form)?",65,16,ottawalanguages,2021-05-26 02:25:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/nl66m9/d_why_is_convolution_a_meaningful_mathematical/,0,statistics

i44ysb,[C] Finding a fulfilling job in statistics/math,"I have a B.S. and M.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics and I've been working as a modeling & simulation analyst for military projects for the last 2-3 years.

The notes that inspired me to find such notes in mathematical statistics are on high-dimensional statistics from MIT OCW: [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s997-high-dimensional-statistics-spring-2015/lecture-notes/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s997-high-dimensional-statistics-spring-2015/lecture-notes/). They fulfil all the desiderata.

In contrast to the usual suspects (Casella Berger, Rice, Wackerley), I am going for lecture notes because these books are massive treaties, and I am looking for a more condensed one- or two-semester reading type.

**EDIT 30/Mar/2022:**I found a set of notes close to what I intended. However, they are slightly basic for my knowledge. There are notes for Mathematical Statistics and a two-semester course on Probability theory (which I might use).

r3crja,"[Career] Anyone successfully moved from Data Science (or statistician) to python developer or likewise? Was it any better, and if so, how did you make the switch?","Full disclosure: I posted over on the data science channel too, but what to see what the statistician have to save about the field of data science?

I'm an experience senior data scientist with a PhD and starting to really hate the field. I have a lot of experience in AWS, docker, python etc. and thinking about making a change. My observation is that a software dev with some data knowledge is in huge demand, but a statistician (or data scientist) is expected not only to be a master of their own field but also master software development. A standard python developer appears to be in greater demand than a data scientist (and there is less competition). 

I hoped over the years that this field would get better, but they anecdotally appear to be getting worse. It just seems like the wild west out there.

Employers expect far, far too much out of a data scientist. In my current role, I'm doing everything: Business analytics, research, public speaking, stakeholder engagement, Database design and management/model deployment, Christ even IT support. I spend half my time fighting the actual IT department to get access to the tools I need and the other half fighting to get access to data. The number of people who can't wrap their heads around the fact that to do data science, I actually need data, is astounding!

I've worked in big corporations, universities and big corporations, and it's always the same. The skillset is endless: statistics, ML (NLP, time-series, DL), production level python, cloud deployment, database management, Excel/VBA, Tableau, SQL, and the wages in the UK are pathetic. I still earn less than my friends who know only SQL.

I am thinking about becoming a python developer. It pays betters and is a far narrower field of study. Anyone make the leap?

pk9ay3,[E] Understanding the calculus behind statistics,"
Hey all,

I'm about to finish my PhD in exercise science and have enjoyed the process of choosing statistical tests to answer questions and working through the data analysis. However, my math knowledge is limited with intro statistics courses, linear algebra and no calculus. I can choose a test through the help of a statistician or internet resources but I'd like to gain a better understanding of the math behind it. I'm thinking of transferring to a more data analysis career so believe this would be helpful especially with more advanced modeling. 

Any tips on where to begin learning calculus that may be more applicable to stats or good courses?

klxix1,[Q] Interested in probability of my near perfect Gin hand," I was playing Gin against a buddy of mine, and I got dealt this 10 card hand:

Jack, Queen, King, Ace, all of Clubs, two other Kings, Three 9s, and a 7

I was wondering what was the probability of this happening, or of a hand similar to this, maybe with different suits, happening? I know it's probably a big number just for getting the hand in the first place, but on top of that for my friend's hand to have that fourth king, and for him to decide randomly out of his 10 cards to get rid of that one, the number must be huge.

b9yw2r,Nate Silver vs. Nassim Taleb round 2,"So FiveThirtyEight has recently launched a new project, [How Good Are FiveThirtyEight's Forecasts?](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/checking-our-work/). It's all about being accountable for their projections; they say they feel pretty good about their projections if e.g. 70% of their 7-in-10 forecasts are accurate.

Naturally, noted douchenozzle and ""The Donald Trump of Nate Silvers"" Nassim Taleb (thanks /u/Lost_Traveller2_ for the apt nickname) still takes issue with 538's entire philosophy, and is yet again [arguing with Nate on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1114159160990535681)

To be honest, I don't think I'm far enough along in my statistics work to *truly* understand Taleb's argument, but it smells like much ado about nothing to me. Nevertheless, in the /r/Statistics post [about their initial spat from 3 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/acc7el/an_interesting_argument_between_nate_silver_and/), Taleb definitely had his supporters. I think some discussion would be very valuable.

Here are some unconnected thoughts of mine:

* In an argument, if one side is being a complete asshole and the other isn't, your prior should be that the asshole is wrong. And [Nassim is definitely an asshole](https://twitter.com/dikgaj/status/1113808780897210371).

* Nassim loves talking about ""skin in the game"", but has had no skin in the game for over 10 years. Sure, he made some falsifiable claims about the stock market prior to the 2008 crash that turned out to be at least somewhat true, but his [""\[finance\] involvement \[is\] totally passive from 2010 on""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb#Finance_view). He's an author, not a quantitative trader or political forecaster.

* He also certainly has never put together an election model himself, so his criticism comes off as Monday-morning quarterbacking at best, and blatantly intellectual dishonesty at worst.

* He's extremely conceited and thinks he knows better than every other statistician. This can be true sometimes, e.g. Andrew Gelman probably knows more about null hypothesis significance testing than like 80% of the field combined, but you don't get the know-it-all vibe from [his blog](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu). That's yet another strike against Taleb.

11efku4,"[Q] How do you decide when a logistic regression model is ""good""?","Hi, I didn't really cover this in school but it's now coming up in my job... I've looked online without much success, I think I just need someone to explain it to me.

One view I've seen says that basically the only thing that matters is the classification rate on the test data: we use the model to get probabilities, and define a cutoff for what the response should be. Then the model is good if we correctly guess a lot of them right. (In my case the cutoff is just 0.5, and I've been seeing if we correctly guess more than half of them)

That makes sense, and it's easy to follow, but I feel like there should be other things we should be using. 

For example, in R I can use the summary() function on the model and it tells me the residual deviance and the AIC. All I know about these stats is that lower is better, but how much lower?

If it says that the null deviance is 3000 on 2340 degrees of freedom and the residual deviance is 2800 on 2335 degrees of freedom, then is that good?

ry7007,[Q] What’re some well paying careers in statistics?,"I was originally thinking about getting a PhD since I do love the subject, want to become an expert in it, and I wanna be a professor later down the road (like mid-forties ish). Plus, you learn to do research on your own. I was thinking I could do consulting on the side throughout my PhD and then afterwards work in either quantitative finance, data science, or full-time consulting (maybe even my own consulting firm or a startup). However, living on barely minimum wage and an excruciating amount of workload for 5 years isn’t exactly the most appealing or ideal. So I wanna explore my options a bit more. 

So my question is: what’re some well-paying careers related to statistics? And what educational background do you need? I’d ideally want something with ~$200K median, with potential for even higher income (I know its a bit on the higher end, but thats why I’m asking around). 

Is it worth sticking to a PhD? My thinking is that its a lot of hard work but it also has a low risk (in terms of employment) and high reward (in terms of income). It also opens a lot of doors for more senior positions, making the income potential greater. But perhaps this is an overkill? 

I’ve also considered picking up a CS major to go with stats and maybe going into SWE on the data analytics side, since that tends to have a decent income potential. That also opens the door for founding a tech-related startup (ambitious, I know). 

I’ve also heard of a lot of people getting a masters in stats and then becoming a ML engineer, which can go up to $500K, according to some sources I know. However, I must say that I’m not sure about the longevity of such positions and if they’ll even be around in say 2 decades.

g7aoa8,[Discussion] CMV: Lindley's paradox is uninteresting and we should forever stop discussing and citing it,"Lindley's  paradox states vaguely that a Bayesian and a frequentist can come to  very different conclusions based on a seemingly straightforward  analysis. The problem is generally set up that you have some parameter  \[theta\] and some data that inform that parameter. Wikipedia gives the  example of theta being female/male sex ratio in live births. A frequentist would  test the hypothesis that the ratio is 1.0 and come to the conclusion in  very large datasets that this hypothesis is unlikely due to the oft  observed phenomenon that more live births are female than male. A  Bayesian however would test the hypothesis that the observed result is  more likely than the null result by comparing the posterior density  under the observed frequency with the posterior density under the null  and conclude that that the evidence against the null hypothesis is  actually quite weak. In other words, for a frequentist p<<0.05 and  for a Bayesian p>>0.05.

This is dumb. Why do I still come across papers in which it is mentioned?

Why  is this dumb? As Lindley himself notes, the frequentist p-value is an  ""area under the curve"" (cumulative probability) measure while the  Bayesian p-value is a measure of the ""ordinate"" (probability density).  The frequentist is interested (apparently) in estimating the cumulative  proportion of similar studies that would produce results as extreme as  the data, were the null true. The Bayesian is interested (apparently) in estimating the evidence for the exact value obtained in the data at hand  versus the evidence for the exact value of the null hypothesis,  ignoring all other possibilities.  In other words, it's a comparison of a  CDF with a ratio of a PDF/PMF at two values. The only thing tying these two things together is the entirely arbitrary name of ""p-value."" Lindley  (and nearly everyone else) admits this is not a real paradox.

OK,  we admit it's not a real paradox. In fact, the comparison is bogus  because we are comparing CDFs with PDFs/PMFs. Why, then, don't we call it a  paradox when comparing a mean with a standard deviation - a mean can be  zero but a standard deviation is >0. But these are both called ""statistics."" Must be a paradox! This applies  to any other two unlike things with labels in common.

I'm  fired up about this because I keep seeing references to it as though  it's some important result. Lindley's original paper has 1140 citations!  Gelman has written about it twice on his blog ([https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2013/03/11/my-problem-with-the-lindley-paradox/](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2013/03/11/my-problem-with-the-lindley-paradox/)).  It just keeps generating new papers, but I see nothing profound in it  other than the fact that the term ""p-value"" does not refer to something  that can be compared with other similarly labeled objects regardless of  how they were generated. There is nothing profound in the statement ""Language is sometimes imprecise."" I would like to see this paper become verboten  as either a citation or as the basis for new arXiv papers.

Change my view!

dvbljh,[D] Any new approaches to causal inference in time series data coming from machine learning?,"Hey people, :)

I've been really interested in the topic of causal inference in time series data the last year or so. I feel like [I've surveyed most statistical approaches to the problem](https://medium.com/@shay.palachy/inferring-causality-in-time-series-data-b8b75fe52c46?source=friends_link&sk=37de8f0c1ab78e04d3a5cf1cdc5f3282), and also new approaches coming from fields like chaos and information theory (this is also apparent in [a literature review-y blog post I wrote about the topic](https://medium.com/@shay.palachy/inferring-causality-in-time-series-data-b8b75fe52c46?source=friends_link&sk=37de8f0c1ab78e04d3a5cf1cdc5f3282)).

I did not, however, dig deep enough into ideas coming at this problem - specifically on time series data - from the field of machine learning, and so I'd love to hear about any you know about. This is especially interesting to me because of the complicated relation between predicators and causal drivers has gotten more attention in ML in recent years, I think.

I can add a few contributions coming from ML to this problem in the context of non-temporal data:

Judea Pearl, who is a prominent researcher in the field and who has developed the structural approach to casual inference, recently wrote a very interesting piece on [causal inference tools and reflections on machine learning](http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r481.pdf) \[[Pearl, 2018](http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r481.pdf)\]. He also wrote a [thorough overview of the topic of causal inference](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall09/cos597A/papers/Pearl2009.pdf) \[[Pearl, 2009](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall09/cos597A/papers/Pearl2009.pdf)\].

[David Lopez-Paz](https://lopezpaz.org/), a research scientist at [Facebook AI Research](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research-fair/), leads very interesting research on casual inference in general, and in the context of learning frameworks and deep learning specifically. Highlights include [posing causal inference as a learning problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02398) (specifically of classifying probability distributions), [causal generative neural networks](http://causal%20generative%20neural%20networks/), [incorporation of an adversarial framework for causal discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04929) and [discovering causal signals in images](http://discovering%20causal%20signals%20in%20images/).

[Krzysztof Chalupka](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/~kchalupk/index.html) has done some fascinating [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ieTR4uEAAAAJ&hl=en) in the intersection of deep learning and causal inference. Highlights include a [deep-learning-based conditional independence test](https://github.com/kjchalup/independence_test), [causal feature learning](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~fehardt/papers/CEP2017.pdf), [visual causal feature learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2309) and [causal regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02604).

Finally, \[[Dong et al. 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22730429)\] have used Multi-Step Granger Causality Method (MSGCM), a method developed to identify feedback loops embedded in biological networks using time-series experimental measurements, for the identification of feedback loops in neural networks.

I would love to hear about more causality-related approaches coming out of ML, especially related to time series data.

 I'm wondering if anyone knows a good source that explains the difference between the frequency list and Bayesian interpretation of confidence intervals well.

a6x275,What books would you recommend for an engineer wanting to gain a solid understanding of statistics?,"### EDIT:

Here's an example of an application in my work. I'm mainly going to be running mechanical tests to collect strain gage data to quantify the mechanical properties of composite materials. I want to be able to develop a statistical basis on the number of test samples, and given a large enough sample size, develop some standard mechanical properties.

[Here's an example](http://www.tc.faa.gov/its/worldpac/techrpt/ar03-19.pdf) of some standard statistical methods we use in the aviation industry to accomplish this. I can obviously follow the equations, but I want to be able to understand how the equations were derived so I can explain them to my colleagues and outside parties (e.g. auditors). And if necessary develop my own statistical tests if the prescribed ones either don't work or aren't applicable.

----

Hey all, I'm hoping some of you can point me in the right direction. I'm looking for books that will give me a good mathematical foundation in statistics so that I can apply it to my engineering work, and Python.

I have a B.Sc in Aerospace Engineering, so I have some formal training in math but only up to the usual differential equations & linear algebra. I took one undergrad course in statistics a long time ago as part of my Applied Math minor, but the professor was pretty terrible and I didn't learn anything.

A few years ago I picked up Python (mainly as a hobby), but I've been finding more and more use for it in my professional work as an aerospace engineer. Specifically, the use of `pandas` for data analysis, and utilizing Jupyter notebooks as a formal documentation process. I do machine learning stuff on the side as a hobby, and I also have a long-standing interest in econometrics.

yfubif,"[Q] In business, it seems like we care much more often about Type II errors than Type I errors.","I often seem to encounter situations in business where Type I errors don't seem very important.

Say we're testing two images on our website and want to know which one causes more conversions, so I use a two-tailed test with the null hypothesis that there is no difference in conversion rates between the images. In this scenario, it seems like I shouldn't care much about making a Type I error. If the null hypothesis is true, but I incorrectly conclude that it can be rejected and implement the ""winner"", there's actually no downside to my business: we don't lose any conversions, because the null hypothesis is true so it never mattered at all which I chose. Whichever one I picked there would be no change to conversions. I guess the opportunity is missed to realise that this test was a waste of time and maybe avoid implementing pointless tests in the future, but considering only this one test, if we assume the null is true then my choice is unimportant and therefore so is the statistical significance of my results.

What does seem to matter far more is power. If there is a true difference between these alternatives, even a very small one, sometimes in business it's really important that I be able to detect it. If improving conversion a few percentage points can earn my company millions of dollars, then I need to set up my test so that we find those tiny effects.

So... is this correct? Am I missing something about the practical interpretation of significance here? If this is the case, why is it that so much time and literature and tooling focuses on the significance of results rather than the power?",60,24,fang_xianfu,2022-10-28 17:07:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/yfubif/q_in_business_it_seems_like_we_care_much_more/,0,statistics

hef2tw,[R] statistics in a mango farm,"Hello everyone, I would like to get some help with this:
I would like to try using some statistics in my mango farm. Mango season is almost here which it means that buyers are already asking for offers. What i usually do before putting a price is to hire a guy that comes and does an estimate, he walks around the farm and guesses how many mangos are per tree and then he adds all the mangos and comes to a estimation of all the farm. He goes something like this: this tree has 80 mangos, this one looks like it has 60, this one 100.... until he counts the 1800 trees. (Its also important to say that while he is guessing how many mangos are per tree he is also guessing the weight of each one by looking at the size). 

If I get a random sample of mango trees and count each mango per tree and then i weight them. What kind of information can i get?? What would be the minimum sample size i should use? Would this method be more exact??? 

The information i would like to get: how many Tons/Kgs I could have in my 1800 mango tree farm. This way i can put a price on it. Or whats the probability that the mango farm end up weighing more then X kgs. Would it be possible to get this information? What else could statistics tell about my farm? 

Thank you all!

Edit: i would like to add that this guy that helps me estimate the total Kilograms of the farm has been pretty accurate, i can also get an estimate myself by looking at previous years, but i just got wondering what kind of data will i be able to get with statistics.",62,26,Antonio97x,2020-06-23 13:58:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/hef2tw/r_statistics_in_a_mango_farm/,0,statistics
fxw6e8,Help making sure I understand partial correlation [Question]," 

Partial correlation has been a gap in my stats education and now that I'm learning about ARIMA I need to make sure I understand partial correlation. Let me write out my ELI5 (more like ELI-undergrad) understanding of partial correlation and see if I have this conceptually correct:

Imagine I am interested in the bivariate correlation between X and Y, but am concerned a third variable Z may be influencing this correlation because of inter-correlations between X, Y and Z.

To control for the effects of Z, I first regress Z on X using a simple linear regression. From the regression I can extract the residuals, e(x).

Next I would do the same regressing Z on Y and extracting the residuals, e(y).

The bivariate correlation between e(x) and e(y) is the partial correlation between X and Y, having now controlled for Z. The conceptual reason this works is that the residuals from these 2 regressions (Z,X) and (Z,Y) are direct measures of variation in X and Y that is NOT explained by Z. Thus the correlation of the residuals captures the direct relationship between X and Y.

Do I have it right?",57,6,None,2020-04-09 17:04:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/fxw6e8/help_making_sure_i_understand_partial_correlation/,0,statistics

I've been wanting to get a bit more into Bayesian statistics for a while, and thought now should be the time. It's not like I want to be a absolute expert, but just getting a good grasp of it.

I need a book that explains the disadvantages/advantages (or something like that) with great examples etc., before I really go on rocking the equations.

So yeah, does this exist ? And maybe even with a neutral approach to both ideas. I really don't like it when it gets to forced.

It should be mentioned that I have a PhD in physics, so I am not afraid of the math if I eventually should pursue it more in depth. But I  just got burned too many times by learning a lot of math, without never truly getting the foundation of why this math is clever. And that's why I am trying to take it the other way around this time.",56,34,Lynild,2021-11-24 00:25:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/r0rjvd/q_book_about_bayesian_suggestions/,0,statistics

mrfc9x,[D] advantages of bayesian neural network over regular neural networks,"https://youtu.be/OVne8jDKGUI

This is a really good video that explains the differences between regular neural networks and bayesian neural networks. Apparently in bayesian neural networks, the weights aren't assigned a fixed value but instead each weight is assigned a probability distribution (e.g. each weight is given a normal probability distribution and we calculate the mean and variance).

In which instances is this approach advantageous compared to regular neural networks?",59,37,jj4646,2021-04-15 14:03:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/mrfc9x/d_advantages_of_bayesian_neural_network_over/,0,statistics
ktmumt,[Research] Can I use a Krushal-Wallis One-Way Anova test if I violate the homogeneity of variance assumption?,"In my research, I violated the normality assumption of a standard one way anova test, so I thought I'd opt for this Krushal-Wallis test.

However, I realized I also violate the homogeneity of variance assumption, and I have conflicting information on the internet of whether or not I can use a Krushal -Wallis test if both theses assumptions are violated (see below).

[https://www.statstest.com/kruskal-wallis-one-way-anova/#Similar\_Spread\_Across\_Groups](https://www.statstest.com/kruskal-wallis-one-way-anova/#Similar_Spread_Across_Groups) (States that Krushal Wallis test must comply with the homogeneity of variance assumption).

As you can see, I'm clearly conflicted by this and don't know whether this test is appropriate or not when I violate the 2 assumptions of the standard Anova test.

&#x200B;

ALTERNATIVELY, if anyone can tell me a better test to use when testing if there is a significant difference between 6 groups with unequal sample sizes which violate the normality assumption and homogeneity of variance assumption with continuous data and independent samples.

jtd476,[D] Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai's post-election analysis of voter fraud in Michigan counties... what's right and what's wrong?,"Referring to video here: https://youtu.be/Ztu5Y5obWPk


***TL;DR- What does this analysis get correct and what does it get wrong? Anything in between (half-assed)? Please be serious in your response to this thread.***

I'm trying to let go of my bias as I do identifying as left-leaning progressive, I'm a 30yo caucasian male living in a blue county on the west coast, I'm sure the list goes on. Before all of those things, I attempted to watch this video as a statistician- I have five semesters of stats under my belt, about to finish MS in molecular biology. All of those disclaimers out of the way, I'm posting here for objective (insofar as is possible) critique on this analysis.

So far, what issues I've been able to pick out after watching 45min in *once* is as follows, in no certain order:

-Not a single statistic is given. I understand it was mentioned the video was an attempt to explain to any person who could then explain it to another, but good luck doing that with the concept of a t-test, let alone a full-on analysis. I saw no r-squared, no line equation, no in-depth discussion of the flat-to-negative correlation (thus no explanation of effects on leverage), no analyses of homoscedasticity (according to previous point, big issue there), no mathematical relation within or between counties... No statistics to be seen. 

-The raw data was not shared, linked to, identified simply. This likely happens more often than I'd appreciate, but in such a case as this, I would really appreciate them being so transparent as to make the data available for others to analyze, as any scientist should if they are thorough enough to accept both confirmation and critique. 

-Confounding variables were left virtually untouched. The Discussion portion of the video touched lightly on some possible effects, but hardly enough or at a worthy depth to consider them as willfully pointing out their own biases.

-The graphs, alluded to as being basically identical (in their words, more or less- can't quite it as such, but you get it), have different axis ranges... what happened to starting with 0% and ending with 100%?

-Many issues in regards to the last point, where major discrepancies in the parameters are present and even obvious (e.g. straight ticket reaching past 80% in one county vs hardly past 30% in another). I wouldn't have passed intro to stats if I had used graphs like this!!

-I wish I could state what I found right with the analysis, but what was done right? It felt like I was being sucked into a knee-jerk type of news story far moreso than I was a statistical analysis. How am I supposed to overcome this apparent bias of mine; can this even be called an analysis?


Again, I'm posting this in hopes a professional statistician (not someone who has studied molecular biology far moreso than statistics as is my case) will be able to provide a true (not necessarily looking for a comprehensive) critique (not insult, let's be civil) of this presentation. 

One of my biggest concerns is this: what could cause the horizontal-to-negative average we see? 


Admin and readers, alike, please note: I understand this is inherently political, but I do hope we can focus on the statistics and methods rather than the crap show that has lead to its existence in the first place. If I am out of line, for any reason, posting this here, I humbly apologize and accept its removal from this sub (might I ask that you suggest a sub in which it would be more appropriate- of course in a serious manner... sarcasm won't help this much even though I can enjoy it from time to time). 

I apologize, also, for any probable typos as I'm using a new phone to post this, which has yet to learn my typing style. 

Thank you for your (serious and thought-out) responses. I do look forward to learning through this interaction.

Well, I have a solution for you.  Simply, duplicate the data until the p-value is where you want it to be.

uvgesv,[D] Why is it Important to Simulate Data?,"I was watching this video on an R package designed for ""Simulating Survival Times"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJTYsncvpvI). I decided to read more about this topic in the corresponding paper written by the authors (https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v097i03).

In this paper, they mention the relevance of simulating survival times: ""When conducting simulation studies to evaluate the performance of new and existing statistical methods for analyzing survival data, one is required to simulate event times under a known data generating model. Similarly, one may need to simulate event times for the purpose of power calculations when designing new studies.""

In the video itself (@ 2:11), the presenter also mentions the relevance of simulating survival times

However, I still don't understand why simulating survival times is useful and necessary. For instance, if I were to fit a Logistic Regression model to some data - I don't think it would be very important to then start simulating data from this Logistic Regression model?

**The same way - can someone please help me understand why it might be useful and important to simulate data from a survival model?**

In other words :

- Why exactly does evaluating the performance of new or existing statistical methods for survival analysis require simulating random survival times?

- Why exactly does calculating the statistical power require simulating random survival times?

- Why exactly does calculating the uncertainty in model predictions require simulating random survival times?

Thanks!

Note: This is the only thing I can think of: assuming you are able to simulate data from a similar data generating process, then see how accurately the statistical model is able to make predictions about these points?

I feel the answer is obviously heads, however two friends of mine say that because it is a sample size of 1 (and because the weighting could be small), and that this does not overcome the variance and that no conclusion can be made whatsoever from one data point and guessing heads or tails is equally rational.

lmyc9s,[Q] Where to start with Bayesian without a math background?,"Hello all! I'm a recent PhD grad wanting to get my feet wet with Bayesian stats. My general background is in psychology and my doc work was in a Research, Evaluation, Statistics, and Assessment program. It was more focused on research methods and while it broadly touched on a lot of statistical concepts, we definitely didn't dive into the math behind anything really. We also never touched Bayesian stuff even as a general concept.

As far as my math background, I took trig my freshman year of college and never took another specific math class. My dissertation involved some light structural equation modeling that I did using R, but again it was more about the structuring of the project/questions/interpretations than about the ""how"" of the stats.

My current work is at a community mental health center where I work on evaluating grant programs (mostly centered on criminal justice related projects). My supervisor wants to start incorporating more research/analysis into what we do as opposed to the top level descriptive/demographic info that we're reporting on currently.

I'm really interested in Bayesian ideas, and would have time during my work day to delve into working on learning about it and sharpening that skill set. Are there any books or other resources you'd recommend for this? I've seen the book Statistical Rethinking thrown around a lot in the sub, but I'm not sure how much straight math would be involved.

Is he calculating means and variances per candidate relative to their total vote counts in each state, then calculating z-score? There isn't a ton of information here and he only mentions Georgia. It seems like bad math or improper framing for the question at hand to me but again I'm still learning. I would imagine the problem would include more variables.

g47zel,[Question] What does a Master's in Statistics offer that a Master's in Analytics does not?,"TLDR: Can someone with Stats degree get any role Analytics degree holder can but not vice versa?Should I go for a Masters in stats even though the a Master's in Analytics at NCSU provides great job offers and only lasts 8 months? 

I am interested in the program at NCSU for Master's in Analytics. I also know their Statistics program is ranked pretty high as well. I have a few friends who went through the program after 8 months and were able to land $100k salary jobs. There are few things that I am looking for in a future career but not sure how it pans out when in the industry so wondering if anyone could shed some light.

My concern isn't that it's not possible to get the job doing the program (MSA) after hearing testimonials, but if the program is enough in the long term. I feel that those guys may get good jobs out the gate but maybe be out paced in the future. Does MSA build a good solid foundation on fundamentals to continue to be marketable and in demand in getting jobs in analytics, data science, big data? Or should I be pursuing Statistics?

I like programming/coding and wouldn't mind doing in daily (fairly fluent in java now). However, as I get older, I am told by software engineers that it's hard to keep up with the new technology so most transition into a managerial role. This is why I'm also concerned with pursuing a Master's in Computer because I don't want to be replaced by fresh grads 10 years from now.

I enjoy the analytics side and would like to continue to grow in my knowledge of coding as well. I think I lean a bit more toward programming as something I enjoy and want to continue to be knowledge in data structures and algorithms. At the end of the day, I want to be marketable because of my coding and analytical skills.

I'm very confused at what direction to take and even un-sure if I'm asking the right questions.

Should I go with the 8 month program (NCSU MSA) and hopefully land a good job that pays well, or go with Stats or maybe even CS still? Why is a degree in Stats more advantageous if people still come out of that program with great job offers?",57,20,ss90kim,2020-04-19 13:52:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/g47zel/question_what_does_a_masters_in_statistics_offer/,0,statistics

**Abstract**:

>Machine Learning and Deep Learning have achieved an impressive standard today, enabling us to answer questions that were inconceivable a few years ago. Besides these successes, it becomes clear, that beyond pure prediction, which is the primary strength of most supervised machine learning algorithms, the quantification of uncertainty is relevant and necessary as well. While first concepts and ideas in this direction have emerged in recent years, this paper adopts a conceptual perspective and examines possible sources of uncertainty. By adopting the viewpoint of a statistician, we discuss the concepts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, which are more commonly associated with machine learning. The paper aims to formalize the two types of uncertainty and demonstrates that sources of uncertainty are miscellaneous and can not always be decomposed into aleatoric and epistemic. Drawing parallels between statistical concepts and uncertainty in machine learning, we also demonstrate the role of data and their influence on uncertainty.",57,5,None,2024-01-19 16:16:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/19amqnd/r_sources_of_uncertainty_in_machine_learning_a/,0,statistics

After deciding a Ph.D. is not for me, I've begun looking into master's programs; however, they all seem exorbitantly expensive especially if you go out of state (incredibly unfortunate for me because my current state has no well respected stat program).

ml1tdx,"[D] Using the ""Kolmogorov-Smirnov"" test to safeguard against Concept Drift?","https://imgur.com/a/7ZLkRPI

Suppose we have three variables : x1 (predictor), x2 (predictor) and y (target). We are interested in making a regression model y ~ x1,x2. We have some current data, and we make the regression model (could be any machine learning or statistical model, I just used regression for simplicity). This model is working fine, but now the question of ""concept drift"" arises : How do we know that this regression model will keep working in the future? What if the underlying process that is generating the data has started to (significantly) change? Perhaps it's time to retrain the model, or to restart completely?

I understand that this is a very abstract concept and that there is no single answer to deal with this. But here is an idea I had : suppose we decided to compare all the marginal and conditional distributions for all combinations of variables, for old vs new data - if these distributions are ""statistically similar"" (e.g. determined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) - is there some grounds to believe that no major form of concept drift has occurred? I understand this might not be the best approach - converting the observed data into continuous probability distributions (using kernel density estimation) comes with its own statistical risk, these continuous probability distributions might not fit the data well, therefore the results from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test might be deceptive.

What does everyone think of this approach for studying concept drift?

f00doj,"[D] Deaths of Coronavirus ""too smooth"" to be accurate","I wonder if the statistics about Coronavirus fatalities are subject to some kind of manipulation.

I am using this source:

[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-toll/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-toll/)

I am taking the fatalities of the last 16 days:

8, 16, 15, 24, 26, 26, 38, 43, 46, 45, 58, 64, 66, 73, 73, 82

I gave a look a the numbers, they seemed ""too smooth"", i.e. too regular, so I decided to do some quick analysis.

I  assume that every daily increment follows a Poisson distribution (it seems  reasonable, but it may very well be a wrong assumption).

I did some 2nd order polynomial estimation of log(increment) in order to estimate the parameter of the underlying distribution. I assume the parameter of the Poisson distribution doesn't change drastically and irregularly.

The fitting matches the daily deaths very well (data sampled with Poisson distribution should be noisier):

[https://imgur.com/a/dQbZ6T5](https://imgur.com/a/dQbZ6T5)

In order to quantify the data I calculated the log-likelihood of the real data, considering for each day a Poisson distribution with parameter given by the fitting above.

I compared the obtained value with the distribution of the log-likelihood of random (fake) vector drawn with the same Poisson distribution.

Conclusion: the real data has a log-likelihood higher than \~**98.2%** of the random vectors I tried.

[https://imgur.com/a/5fLbBBL](https://imgur.com/a/5fLbBBL)

Note 1: about the Poisson distribution, I think it's a good assumption, due to how deaths in a specific day can be independent. If, for the sake of argument, there is some correlation between death events (i.e. patients from the same family/building/etc...), that should actually make the variance of the underlying probability distribution even bigger, and that would make the data even more suspicious.

Note 2: these results don't hold for the number of diagnosed people, where the opposite happens: the log-likelihood of the actual data is much lower than the random vectors. This means that the Poisson distribution is not a good distribution for the number of diagnosis. This probably means that diagnosis are correlated, and that's quite possible, especially if you have big batches of diagnoses made across several days communicated in a single day.

So, I would be ok with overly noisy data, but overly regular data in this case seem suspicious.

Edit: I added the deaths for the last 2 days. The anomaly is a bit stronger.

Edit 2: as suggested, one explanation could be the incapability of Chinese doctors/authorities of processing all deaths in a given day, so any spike in daily deaths will spill over into the next day. I am not sure how realistic is that, but indeed that could be indistinguishable from a malicious manipulation of data.

Edit 3: Applied [slim-jong-un](https://www.reddit.com/user/slim-jong-un/)'s suggestion of applying the fitting on any random sample (rather than using the fitting of real data on all of them), to make the comparison fair. This decreases the value above to 98.2%.",59,49,flying_baboon,2020-02-06 22:29:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/f00doj/d_deaths_of_coronavirus_too_smooth_to_be_accurate/,0,statistics

aoauet,Analyzing suppressed data: A case study using R and Stan,"The [Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1177/text), enacted in 2015, requires states to provide data “that can be cross-tabulated by, at a minimum, each major racial and ethnic group, gender, English proficiency status, and children with or without disabilities,” taking care not to reveal personally identifiable information about any individual student. As state education agencies come into compliance with ESSA, they will be publishing more and more datasets which at least partially suppress or omit data to protect student privacy.

Recently the Oregon Department of Education released new data on high school graduation rates of specific student groups, broken down by gender, race/ethnicity, and status as English language learners, as economically disadvantaged, as homeless, and as disabled.  Some of the data in this file has been suppressed: if any group contains fewer than 10 students, an asterisk (\*) is entered instead of the number of students in the group.

In this case study we show how non-government statisticians (who are limited to using the suppressed data) can analyze this data from a Bayesian perspective using R and Stan.

I was recently talking to a professor of mine who told me a story about a presenter at a conference that nearly got into a fist fight with an audience member over a specific approach to a problem. He also told me that bitterness is easy to find in this field, with some researchers going as far as insulting each other in publications.

Is there any well known rivalries in the field you can point me in the direction of to read more about? It’s a nice break from school work and is extremely entertaining!

Thanks!",59,73,_bandwagoner_,2019-01-22 07:22:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/aikfq3/rivalries_in_the_field_of_statistics/,0,statistics
7uoq8a,Accidentally fell in love with Statistics - what do I do please help me god,"As a requirement for my Psyc program I took a Data Analysis/Statistics course and now I find myself disturbed that I'm fantasizing about data sets while hanging out with friends.

The idea of being able to do this as a job is really exciting, I would want nothing more than to sit there with data and work through them all day. This experience has also been really strange to me, because I've never been strong or interested in math prior to this course.

I'm trying to figure out if there's a future in this for me and how to obtain it, and I'm getting a lot of weird answers when I look online so I'm hoping someone here can help me.

One concern of mine is the focus on mathematics and programming when going into any kind of data profession. I love my Data Analysis course but I don't know if that love is transferable to the pure math and programming courses required for Statistics, and how similar/relevant the course content is.

A second concern is that none of my Psyc courses are transferable to a Stats/CS/Math Major and vice versa, and I'm paying for school out of pocket so time/money is incredibly valuable. I'd like to avoid spending $1000+ and 4+ months on experimenting if I can make an educated decision about it instead.

Lastly and most importantly, **I don't know what career path is best for what I'm interested in**. I see job titles like Statistician, Data Scientist, Actuarial Analyst, Data Analyst, and even after reading about it all I still feel like I don't quite understand where I might fit in, if anywhere at all.

I also occassionally see people with Data Analyst jobs who have MAs in other fields. Should I continue to pursue Psychology with heavy Data courses and finish my MA, and if so, will there be careers for me in Data Analysis? If not, **could anyone provide a professional opinion on which career path resembles most to the work I do in my Data/Statistics class (ie. standard deviation, probability, z-scores, percentiles, etc.)?** And if possible, the most time/cost-effective way of pursuing it? If it helps, I have a 4.33 GPA in my classes including my current standing in my Data/Stats course. 

Sorry for the long post, thanks in advance to anyone who replies!

18syojm,[Q] Learning the Bayesian framework as a non-statistician,"I work in a research group where most expertise is within experimental research in molecular biology. Some of us do, however, work with epidemiology, statistical modeling (some causal but mostly prediction and ML), facilitated by excellent in-house biobanks and medical registries/journals. I have a MS and PhD within molecular biology, but have worked mostly on bioinformatics and biostatistics over the past five years.

I assume most researcher like me have been trained (or are self-learned) in frequentist statistics. Many prominent statisticians, such as Frank Harrell, however, claim that the Bayesian approach is generally superior, and I am considering whether I should invest time in learning this as an adjuvant to my frequentist thinking. 

I am lacking in particular the mathematical background in statistics, but still would like to learn to use Bayesian statistics in an applied manner. Would be happy to hear from you whether this is worthwhile or if I'm ""wasting"" my time. I would like to learn it nonetheless because it's fun to learn and widen one's horizon, but don't know just how *much* time I should invest.

r4bg7j,[D] How do you think we should address utter BS?,"**Mods**: I didn't know how to show people what this guy was talking about without posting a link. I wanted to post a picture of just what he said, but of course I can't post a picture here. Please let me know what I should be doing if this is not allowed.

So this kind of thing gets a little upsetting: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6869149733936607232--tat

How do we address this?

*Note I have edited the below.*

There is a certain amount of truth to the parametric modelling claims - but in my case, at least, that's just a starting point. I always check generalization. Every statistically trained person I know in the field does, too. There's not just attitudes here, there's deceit.

In general, as a community, we have to fight this kind of misinformation somehow. Anyone have any ideas? Or any stories of dealing with this in the past?

**Edits**

And to say what I have said in a comment - yeah, sure, there is a grain of truth in the overuse of parametric models (by some, at least. For most of us, I think, it's just a starting point). What I am objecting to here is that he accuses the entire community of it, and says it's all we do. That's a problem for all of us.

But I now wish I could change the title of this post. It's not complete BS. And sure, statistics isn't a perfect discipline.

o2k1zm,[Question] Is generalization of the statement 'Correlation is not causation' correct or not correct ?,"Recently I stumbled upon some tweets which were critical of the latest book "" The noise by Kahneman, Sunstein and Sibony. The criticism was mainly centered around the fact that the book had stated 'causation implied correlation.""

However one tweet by caught my eye, The author is perhaps hinting that sometimes ""correlation can be a sign of causation"".? (I hope I am not misinterpreting his statement). Below it the quoted tweet.

>Correlation: everyone who I've ever seen mention ""correlation is not causation"" in conversation has been a fool.    
>  
>Causation: anyone who mentions ""correlation is not causation"" in conversation is a fool.    
>  
>In my experience, both statements are true. 

That apart...

In my statistical practices too, I often notice in my client meetings that some smarty pants makes the comment ""Hey but correlation is not causation"", whenever I or my colleagues say ""X is strongly correlated with Y"".

Somewhere I feel the over generalization of the statement ""correlation is not causation"" has caused more harm especially at the hands of layman. The layman outright rejects any reports and analysis with the words ""X is correlated with Y"" with a quip ""correlation is not causation"".

My question : Is the generalization of the statement ""Correlation is not causation"" correct ? Also, is the author in the tweet correct to hint that sometimes ""correlation can be a sign of causation?""

P.S. I don't have a training in causality. I understand that there is a huge body of work under the topic of causality.

* Can work almost entirely around your schedule: I’m a full-time student with very few schedule requirements.
* I’m a mid-thirties professional...very reliable, will never miss an appointment, I will always arrive prepared, and I am sincerely interested in the material.
* I have the tech to make the most out of our time: a surface pro for digital writing, multiple screens, multiple webcams, a scanner etc.
* Steady, no haggle income.  Willing to pay a premium for the right tutor. I sincerely appreciate those who help me and have been known to throw small gifts/tokens to people just because.

What will appeal to me:

* I need someone patient:  My undergraduate degree was in marketing and while I cut no corners to get to graduate school I still don’t have great number sense and still struggle to “see” the trick/form needed often. 
* I’m looking for a regular, weekly tutor. I’d like to reserve a static time slot and meet weekly until mid-December. Can start as soon as now.
* If you have some graduate level math experience, the more the better.

7em2vc,ELI5: Why do we use confidence intervals and p-values to draw inference (incorrectly) when we have Bayesian Statistics?,"People attempt to draw conclusions from confidence intervals all of the time such as ""my confidence is small => my point estimate is precise"" and ""I have a 95% confidence interval => Pr( parameter \in CI) = 95%"".  So the reason these two statements are inaccurate is because CIs are really a frequentest a priori kind of argument, where the statements above are attempting to apply a Bayesian understanding to the world.

This phenomenon is really nicely described at length [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-015-0947-8).  The author even goes as far to say ""[So...] how does one then interpret the interval? The answer is quite straightforward: one does not"". So I read this paper and felt very intrigued by the idea, and definitely have bought it in full.  Yet it seems absurd to me that so many statisticians and laymen (this interpretation actually appears in some textbooks, see the above paper) would still use this interpretation if the theory behind it suggests pointedly that it's wrong.

So I ended up asking my econometrics professor about why we learn confidence intervals when they seem strictly inferior to Bayesian approaches to draw conclusions about data, and he told me that it has something to do with the Bernstein-Von Mises, and that the two are roughly the same thing.  

I don't really understand the theorem or the line of reasoning that he derived from it, so hence I came here to see if people can explain the topic in a simple to understand manner like the viewpoint presented in the paper linked above.

1at3lpx,"[Q] How can p-values be interpreted as continuous measures of evidence against the null, when all p-values are equally likely under the null hypothesis?","I've heard that smaller p-values constitute stronger indirect evidence against the null hypothesis. For example:

* p = 0.03 is interpreted as having a 3% probability of obtaining a result this extreme or more extreme, given the null hypothesis
* p = 0.06 is interpreted as having a 6% probability of obtaining a result this extreme or more extreme, given the null hypothesis

From these descriptions, it seems to me that a result of p=0.03 constitutes stronger evidence against the null hypothesis than p = 0.06, because it is less likely to occur under the null hypothesis.

However, after reading [this](http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2015/03/how-p-value-between-004-005-equals-p.html) post by Daniel Lakens, I found out that *all p-values are equally likely under the null hypothesis* (being a uniform distribution). He states that the measure of evidence provided by a p-value comes from the ratio of its *relative* probability under *both* the null and alternative hypothesis. So, if a p-value between 0.04 - 0.05 was 1% likely H0, while also being 1% likely under H1, this low p-value does not present evidence against H0 at all, because both hypothesis explain the data equally well. This scenario plays out under 95% power and can be visualised on this [site](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/pdist/).

Lakens gives another example where if we have power greater than 95%, a p-value between 0.04 and 0.05 is actually more probable to be observed under H0 than H1, meaning it cant be used as evidence against H0. His explanation seems similar to the concept of Bayes Factors.

My question: How do I reconcile the first definition of p-values as continuous measures of indirect evidence against H0, where lower constitutes as stronger evidence, *when all p-values are equally likely under H0*? Doesn't that mean that interpretation is incorrect?

Shouldn't we then consider the relative probability of observing that p-value (some small range around it) under H0 VS under H1, and use that as our measure of evidence instead?",54,27,AstralWolfer,2024-02-17 14:47:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/1at3lpx/q_how_can_pvalues_be_interpreted_as_continuous/,0,statistics

n05ryd,[D] do machine learning models handle multicollinearity better than traditional models (e.g. linear regression)?,"When it comes to older and traditional models like linear regression, ensuring that the variables did not have multicollinearity was very important. Multicollinearity greatly harms the prediction ability of a model.

However, older and traditional models were meant to be used on smaller datasets, with fewer rows and fewer colums compared to modern big data. Intuitively, it is easier to identify and correct multicollinearity in smaller datasets (e.g. variable transformations, removing variables through stepwise selection, etc.)

In machine learning models with big data - is multicollinearity as big a problem? 

E.g. are models like randon forest known to sustain a strong performance in the presence of multicollinearity? If so, what makes random forest immune to multicollinearity?

Are neural networks and deep neural networks abke to deal with multicollinearity ? If so, what makes neural networks immune to multicollinearity?

jpu725,[D] Should Election Forecasts Be Martingales?,"N. Taleb has a paper where he argued that election forecasts should be martingales ([Taleb 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06351.pdf)). He remarked that FiveThirtyEight's forecast vary too much.

A. Gelman coauthored a paper where he agrees with that statement, saying that Bayesian models produce martingales ([Gelman et al. 2020](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/jdm200907b.pdf))

I have read some blogs and comments that disagree:

E. Yu [wrote here](http://quant.am/statistics/2020/10/11/taleb-silver-feud/) that Nate Silver's forecasts are not election forecasts, but measures of voter intent (who would win if the election where today). 

Jose [wrote here](http://sitacuisses.blogspot.com/2020/10/of-martingales-and-elections.html) that martingales can still produce very bad forecasts, and people should try to find better ways to model elections.

**I am still confused:**

1. Should a sequence of forecasts of the same outcome be a martingale?
2. If forecasts should be martingales, is it appropriate to criticize the forecast on the hand of a statistical test of the martingale property?
3. What does the martingale property have to do with the variability of the forecasts?

I would really like to hear your opinions on this, since I am as intrigued as I am ignorant about the topic.

ba3gtj,Using statistical methods to find fake data,"Goodday all,

I was hoping you could give me a couple of pointers on a problem I am working on.

I was asked to help detect fake data. Basically, there is an organization that is responsible for doing some measurements, but this year due to a lot of politics this task was taken over by another organization. However, due to some mixed interests and inexperience, they fear that this new organization might not give reliable data, and instead at some point decide to fake some of the results. Just being able to say that the data is (in)consistent would be great, and could lead to more proper investigation if necessary.

While I have worked with statistics for scientific purposes quite a bit, I have never had to doubt whether my data was even legit in the first place (apart from your regular uncertainties), so I can only guess what the right approach would be.

The data is as following: there are three columns: counts for type A, counts for type B, and a timestamp. The columns for type A and type B contain integer data (nonzero) with a mean of around 3, and can be assumed to be relatively independent for each row. The timestamps should not follow any regular pattern. The only expectation is that the sum of type A and type B (~200) is relatively constant compared to previous years, though a bit of variation would not be weird.

My best guess: check if the counts for type A and type B are consistent with a Poisson distribution (if the verified data also matches this). In addition, check if the separations in the timestamps indeed seem to be randomly distributed. Finally, check if there is a correlation between the counts and the timestamp for the verified data, and check if this can also be detected in the trial data. It might also be possible to say something about the ratios between type A and B, but I'm not sure. To summarize: look for any irregularities in the statistics of the data.

I'm hoping that humans are bad enough at simulating randomly distributed data that this will be noticable. ""Oh we've already faked three ones in a row, let's make it more random by now writing down a 6.""

Do you think this is a reasonable approach, or would I be missing some obvious things?

Thank you very much for reading all of this.

js0jzj,[Q] What is the statistical meaning of the specific language used in the Pfizer announcement?,"In the [Pfizer announcement](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-vaccine-candidate-against) this morning they said:
>The case split between vaccinated individuals and those who received the placebo indicates a **vaccine efficacy rate above 90%**, at 7 days after the second dose.""

Does this mean that the current estimated vaccine estimate is above 90% or that they constructed a 95? percent confidence interval with a lower bound of 90% vaccine effectiveness?

Another way to look at this is that at 90% vaccine effectiveness we would expect 8.5 of the 94 infected patients to have received the real vaccine. I think to say **""above 90%""** they would need to make a 95? percent confidence interval which if I am doing correctly means that only 3 or fewer of the patients out of the 94 infected had the real vaccine. That would imply that the current estimated vaccine effectiveness with the numbers they have so far is somewhere between 96.8-100 percent.

io3c77,[Q] How can I get better at statistical consulting?,"I plan on having my PhD in mathematical statistics in December and I've already got a job lined up starting October where a big part of what I will be doing is statistical consulting, with test science and experimental design being one area I will be heavily involved in. While I was tested by the company in my communication and interpretation skills and trust their judgement regarding my abilities, it's still intimidating, and I want to do as good a job as I can. I picked up the book *Statistical Consulting* by Cabrera and read it. That said, I'm nervous (and excited; I'm looking forward to this job).

Here's a couple stories; I'm in a math department, it was tea time, and a fellow grad student came and asked me about how to handle missing data. I laid out some strategies I knew for dealing with missing data and issues to consider, from replacing with the mean to randomly assigning values from others to making linear models for predicting values and so on. Then my adviser came in, the grad student asked the same question, and my adviser asked ""What are you trying to do? Why do you need to impute missing values?"" Rather than give an inventory of methods to consider like I did, he was much more probing, and personally came to the conclusion that the student's data project and research questions were not well defined enough to recommend any procedure for handling the missing data. And I think this was the smarter way to handle the issue, which I did not do.

Even today I was helping my cousin with a research project of his. (My cousin is a PhD student in a different department, but he needs stats and econometrics which is what I do.) Initially I was thinking I was there to help him understand his models and figure out why his Stata code was not working. (I have used Stata in the past but I'm really an R user.) But I chatted with him for a while and the discussion was more expansive than I initially thought. He was fitting a paper's models on a different and much larger data set, and was perplexed by the statistically significant results he was getting, as he said some of those results don't make theoretical sense for the data he was working on. Honestly I didn't know much about where his data came from until the middle of our meeting and there's a lot of statistical challenges in the data set itself I was not aware of until we had that discussion! For instance his model supposedly should not be meaningful in the larger sample but was designed to work for a subsample that he had not separated out, which could explain why he was getting significant results in the overall sample when he felt he should not get such results. (But even taking out that subsample yielded significant results. Also, I had to remind him that his sample sizes were really large and he should look at CIs to get a sense of effect size, but even then he's perplexed by the data's conclusions since these effect sizes are not small except at the CIs' lower bound. I think it might not be illusory and might suggest a flaw in the original paper he's attempting to replicate, maybe calling their conclusions into question. Or he might need to be much more careful about his handling of missing data than basically deleting rows.) I guess in my defense I thought I was there for a ""bugfix"" but it turned into more.

These experiences lead me to believe that I have a lot to learn when it comes to consulting and helping other people with their problems, and I want to get better. What can I do? I read a book but I don't think that's enough. Any tips?

gvf6do,[Q] Is there a link between Cramèr-Rao bound and Shannon's source coding theorem?,"I apologize in advance if my question is irrelevant, my major is not in statistics.

**Is there a link between Cramèr-Rao bound and Shannon's source coding theorem? Are Fisher information and Shannon self-information (used in his definition of entropy) related?**

They seem vaguely correlated but I can't seem to see the link between both.


1 - Both Fisher and Shannon information have "" - log"" in their expression. 

2 - As I understand, both provide an amount of ""novel knowledge"", or ""surprise"", given by some sample

3 - Shannon's source coding theorem and Cramèr-Rao are lower bounds


I recalled quickly some definitions below to help the discussion. Thank you in advance for any answers. 



#Shannon's definition of Entropy and Information

For a random variable X, let the entropy 

`H(X) = E[I(X)]`

Where `I(X) = - log_b_(P_X_)` is the self-information on a chosen base b. 



##Shannon's source coding theorem

Let N i.i.d random variables of entropy H(X). Then the lower bound of bits number for lossles compression is `N.H(X)` bits.



##Fisher information

Under a parametric model of parameter theta, let f(X, theta) be the pdf of a random variable X. The Fisher information of X is then:

`I(theta) = - E[ d^2 log(f) / d theta^2 ]`



##Cramèr-Rao bound

For an unbiased estimator theta^hat , function of N i.i.d samples, its variance has a lower bound:

`Var(theta^hat ) >= 1 / (N I(theta) )`",54,12,Florentin314,2020-06-02 20:31:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/gvf6do/q_is_there_a_link_between_cramèrrao_bound_and/,0,statistics
gffsti,"[S][Q][D]Redditors who do Bayesian inference work, how can Stan and its ecosystem be improved?","I figured I would help the Stan devs by creating this thread to collect user input and suggestions for them to find later if they were looking around for what to incorporate into Stan 3. As I've had to depend more on Stan for my thesis, I've noticed a few areas where Stan could be improved and refined.

For me, these include:

* More differential equation functionality. Differential algebraic, stochastic differential, and delay differential equation solvers would be helpful for mathematical biology-related and ecology-related fields, for instance.

* More centralized documentation for Stan's Math library. I think they are aware of this. It's currently scattered between the outdated Wiki located here (https://github.com/stan-dev/math/wiki) and the main site. 

* Allowing strings to be used as function arguments in the Stan language (recently found out that that was not possible).

This is a genuine and not a rhetorical question. 

Assuming you are skilled in both R and SAS and your organization allows you to choose one or the other to be used in a particular project, why would you choose SAS?

**Background**

It's often said that, at an organizational level, the choice to use SAS is largely driven by external factors such as broader industry norms and regulations. Similarly, at an individual level, it's often said that a person uses SAS only because their organization mandates it or because the individual is, say, an experienced economist and never needed to learn R or other similar tools such as Python, Julia, or S.

I'm quite experienced with R (and frankly enamored with it and its community), but I am only now learning SAS since it's required in my academic program. So now I'm trying to decide whether I should invest time in really learning to use SAS for reasons other than just the possibility that I might work for a current or potential employer that mandates its use.",55,85,hurhurdedur,2019-09-13 21:30:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/d3vxma/q_if_you_know_both_r_and_sas_and_both_are/,0,statistics

82r5cu,Can you help me understand how this distinction between Bayesians and Frequentists leads to different views of data?,"I have read that a key difference between Bayesians and Frequentists is their treatment of probability. Frequentists treat probability as the frequency with which something will happen over the long run. Bayesians treat probability as a measure of their confidence in the outcome of a single event.

I've also read that Frequentists consider models to be fixed, and data to vary; while Bayesians consider models to vary and data to be fixed. 

How exactly do the different treatments of probability lead to these different views of data/models?

viy6wy,Where to go with a statistics background if I hate data analytics? [Q],"Long story short, I’m in a data analytics internship right now at a Fortune 500 company. I have a math and statistics background and I’m going to be a senior in college. I hate industry data analytics. I came here and I’ve been messing with SQL queries all day and it’s too non technical for me to take any interest. I sit with my SME in meetings, he tells me about the data I should pull and visualize, I wrestle with SQL for three hours and then clock out. My passion is in statistics theory, and I want my work to be highly technical in math and statistics. I’m planning on going to graduate school to do an MS/Phd in statistics because I would rather do that than become a junior analyst and have this be my life. 

I’m at a bit of a weird spot now where I’m trying to figure out what I’d like to do with my degree and background now. I want my work to be highly technical and quantitative. Quantitative trading and research (quantitative finance) is something I’m considering. There’s a high barrier to entry, but that’s more interesting to me than what I’d be doing in any data analytics role. Right now my mentality is “become a quant” because industry DS is just not an option for me, it’s too non technical, and if I’m feeling this way as an intern I’m gonna hate it forever when I’m a full time.

I am working on a new book and I just posted an excerpt about Preston's Paradox:

[https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2022/05/16/prestons-paradox/](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2022/05/16/prestons-paradox/)

Here's the short version:

Suppose  every woman has one child fewer children than her mother. Average  fertility would decrease and population growth would slow, right?   Actually, no.  According to Preston's paradox, fertility could increase  or decrease, depending on the initial distribution.

And  if the initial distribution is Poisson (which is close to the truth in  the U.S.) the result of the ""One child fewer"" scenario would be the same  distribution from one generation to the next.

sn1gf0,[Q] [C] Is a masters degree in statistics a worthwhile investment?,"Hi everyone, sorry for the vagueness of the title. For a while now, I've been eyeing my school's 5-year combined BS-MA/MS in statistics program. It's still something I'm pursuing, but I want some outside perspective on the costs/benefits from your POV. I understand that It's a highly personal decision and there are a ton of factors that go into deciding on grad school. Here's a little bit of the research that I've done:

&#x200B;

\- According to payscale, a [bachelors](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Bachelor_of_Science_(BS_%2F_BSc)%2C_Statistics/Salary) degree in statistics has an avg base salary of 72K/year, whereas a [masters](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Master_of_Science_(MS)%2C_Statistics/Salary) degree in statistics has an avg base salary of 88K/year.

\- According to Georgetown's research on the economic value of college majors [here](https://www.jaminfrog.com/clients/georgetown-cew/wiw/test/wiw.php?mgroup=Computers,%20statistics,%20and%20mathematics&dtype=National&i=fa-bar-chart), a graduate degree in statistics (including PhD) has a median income of 100K/year, and a bachelors has a median income of 78K/year

\- A ton of those ""how to become a \_\_\_\_\_\_"" articles list a masters degree in statistics as highly recommended for things like data science, quanitative fiannce, and government statistician roles. Not sure if these are junk, though.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, here's some information about my sistuation. In terms of a career I'm fairly open to different options, but I'm mainly interested in consulting, data science, and quantitative finance. I want to do something that is highly compensated and intellectually challenging, and I would prefer something that involves statistics/math (but I'm open to eventually branching out into strategy or technology roles that don't involve statistics). My plan is to graduate with a BS in statistics and then immediately get my masters in statistics from the University of Pittsburgh the next year. I would graduate with about 25K in debt. As of right now, I think that the potential career advancement opporunities and higher median salary make grad school a worthwhile investment despite the debt. I think the opportunity cost of forgoing a year of entry level salary is the lowest it'll ever be in my career. After emailing my advisor today, I got a weird feeling that maybe I'm wrong, so I'm looking for your advice!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* Given my situation, do you think that getting a masters degree will pay off for me?
* To those who have masters degrees, do you work with people that only have a bachelors? If so, are you compensated higher than them?
* To those that have masters degrees, did you feel like it was easier or harder to get your foot in the door of the job you have now? Do you regret it at all?
* To those who ONLY have a bachelors and don't think a masters degree is worth it, what is your job title and what is your reasoning?
* I understand that this sub is a biased sample, because people who branch away from statistics are less likely to still be following. If you keep up with peers that graduated with a masters in mathematics/statistics but branched out into something unrelated, how are they doing? Is their work challenging, interesting, and well-paid? Do they regret getting the masters?",51,36,colinsschoolaccount,2022-02-07 21:26:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/sn1gf0/q_c_is_a_masters_degree_in_statistics_a/,0,statistics
s7sjtf,"[Q] If a move knocks a Pokemon -exactly- to half health, what is the probability that it will KO the Pokemon next turn?","As I was watching a video by Pokemon speedrunner Werster, I had a thought. If an attack does exactly half damage to my Pokemon—say, 100 damage to my Pokemon with 200 HP—then what is the probability that the same attack, used next turn, will KO the Pokemon? 

It's not 100%, of course. **Pokemon damage calculations have an element of randomness:** the damage an attack does is multiplied by a random integer percentage modifier from 85% to 100%. It's possible that the 100 damage dealt was a ""high roll"" with a 100% randomness modifier, and the next attack will only do 85 HP of damage. Conversely, maybe it was a low roll, and when used again, the attack will do well over 100 HP of damage. **We do not know the ""true"", unmodified damage, only the damage that was taken after the modifier.**

Curious, I decided to be quantitative about this. Here are my assumptions: 

1. I will assume that **the randomness modifier is uniform continuous over [0.85, 1] rather than uniform discrete.** This assumption is strictly incorrect, because only integer percentage values are allowed... but I'm afraid the calculations might become unmanageable otherwise.  
2. The ""unmodified"" damage, **K, is uniformly distributed over all its possible values.** Using our example: if our attack dealt 100 damage, we can be sure that the unmodified damage cannot be less than 100, nor more than 117.65. 
3. Internally, the Pokemon engine operates only with integer values and truncates all decimals. **We ignore rounding effects.**

With friction and air resistance safely neglected, here is my working:

Suppose the Pokemon has H hit points. The first attack did H/2 points of damage.

 I define two random variables:

1) K, the unmodified damage, which is uniform over [H/2, H/1.7], and

2) X, which given K=k, is uniform over [0.85k, k]. 

I multiply P(X>H/2|K=k) with the pdf of K at k, and integrate over the support of K. [Here's my working on pen and paper.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418988920613765123/933372095017148516/IMG_20220119_201641.jpg) _I have a penchant for careless mistakes, so_ please _correct me if I've gone wrong somewhere!_

**The answer turns out to be about 52.7%—a bit more than a coin flip!**

I was a little surprised by this, but on further reflection, I think it makes sense; it seems to be the consequence of assuming uniformity of K. The conditional probability ""spikes"" as the value of K increases, so that for values of K equidistant from the centre, the conditional probabilities do not average out to 50%.

My questions: 

1) Most pressing of all, _are the assumptions reasonable? Are the calculations correct?_

2) Is there a simpler way to do this?

3) Is my intuition for _why_ it's likelier than a coin flip on the mark?

-------------------

## Update

There's a much simpler way to do this which doesn't involve any extra variable or assumption of continuity. The randomness modifier can be considered to be a sixteen-sided die with numbers from 85 to 100, ends inclusive. We roll the dice twice. Since the first attack does exactly half damage, we need to do precisely that much, or more, to KO—that is, the second roll has to be equal to or greater than the first roll. 

This is a simple combinatorial problem: there are 16 x 16 = 256 possibilities total from (85, 85), (85, 86)... to (100, 100). If the first roll was 85, then the second roll can take all 16 values from 85 to 100; if it was 86, then the second can take 15 values; and so on, till there is only 1 valid value for the second roll if the first roll was 100. 16 + 15 + 14 + ... + 1 = 17 x 16/2 = 136. 

**Hence, the probability is 136/256, or 53.125%.** Thank you to /u/MadeOn210922 and /u/JeepMan831 for pointing this out!

There is another wrinkle: **Pokemon has the concept of ""critical hits"".** Most attacks have a 1/16 chance (pre-Gen VII) to do 1.5 times the usual damage. It's fairly obvious that the attack, if it is a critical hit, will always KO. 

Fortunately, it's fairly easy to adjust for this. A critical hit is independent of the randomness modifier and will KO with 100% probability, so we can take a weighted average: (1/16 x 1) + (15/16 x 136/256) = **56.05%, approximately.** 

Gen VII and Gen VIII crits have a base probability of 1/24 instead. Some moves have a higher crit chance, like Slash and Razor Leaf. It's easy to adjust for them in the calculation. Thank you to /u/Bunkerman91 for pointing this out!

Finally, there are some assumptions which have been left unstated. /u/Lemonici pointed out that I've assumed that the move does constant base damage and has 100% accuracy. The second assumption, at least, is not necessary. As far as I know, accuracy is independent of damage calculation. **Simply multiply our 56% figure with the accuracy of the move.** Focus Miss has 70% accuracy, so it'll KO about 39% of the time.

When faced with a data science task, I often find that I naturally start critiquing the data. I sometimes list a couple hundred questions: Why are the multi-time series not equal in length? Was the data unavailable? Why are some values missing? Are they missing at random? Across a particular class? How can we fix this in the future? Why are there zero values? What does zero mean in this context? Is zero real or a default database value for ""not available""? Why are there so many duplicate rows in the data? Are they duplicates, or are they real values? If no ID field is available, then two independent rows may have the same values etc. I list assumption after assumption. If we assume this -> we can do this etc., etc.

I've found mix responses when working with people. So people love my pragmatic and thought-provoking approach to solving problems. I often end up uncovering something that nobody even thought to ask. Others would rather I just glossed over it all and not bothered to ask such questions. What is your experience with this?

kv3f39,[Research] Can we perform chi-squared goodness of fit tests on LASSO or ridge regression estimates?,"In the examples I have seen in the literature the chi-squared goodness of fit test is usually used on least-squares estimates. 

The use of this test seems to hinge on the observation that the least-squares estimate vector will, by definition, minimize the sum of squares of the residuals for each feature.

I believe shrinkage estimators like LASSO and ridge regression by definition do not always reach the minimum SSE (LASSO doesn't even have a closed form solution and is the solution of an optimization problem), but their objectives are still to minimize the sum of squared errors subject to their typical corresponding constraints on the norm of the estimate vector. 

**Therefore does it still make sense to perform a chi-squared goodness of fit test on a LASSO or ridge regression estimate? Or should another test be used?**

iyy27b,"[Q] Why we ""predict"" rather than ""estimate"" random effects?","In using mixed models, many statisticians are scrupulous about using the word ""predict"" rather than ""estimate"" when trying to determine the value of a modeled coefficient. As Robinson put it in the nice paper [*That EBLUP Is a Good Thing*](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1177011926): ""A convention has somehow developed that estimators of a random effect are  called *predictors* while estimators of fixed effects are called *estimators.*"" A practical example is that if a regression model of individuals' likelihood of voting uses state of residence as a random effect, and one wanted to determine the value of a coefficient for the state of Iowa, then a scrupulous statistician would say they need to ""predict"" the value for the state of Iowa.

The prediction/estimation distinction is reflected in terminology such as EBLUP or EBP, but I'm not sure what the roots of this distinction are, and can't come up with examples of where this distinction comes up outside of mixed/random-effects models. Can anyone explain or provide some references for the philosophical reasons underlying the prediction/estimation distinction in this context? I'm especially interested in why this distinction is important in cases where we want to determine the value of a random effect for a specific, observed group (e.g. Iowa in my election example), or what is called a ""new-style"" random effect by [Hodges and Clayton](http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~hodges/PubH8492/Hodges-ClaytonREONsubToStatSci.pdf).",53,11,hurhurdedur,2020-09-24 14:16:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/iyy27b/q_why_we_predict_rather_than_estimate_random/,0,statistics
hxlzm5,[question] Why is the denominator in Bayes rule often ignored?,"More often than not, when a paper is explaining their use of Bayes rule, the denominator (i.e., the evidence) is largely ignored. That is, they would say that the posterior is proportional to the product of likelihood and the prior, dismissing the evidence term as a constant. I understand that the evidence term does not involve the random variable of interest and so it really is just a constant, but to compute the posterior, that constant is needed. If so, where does it come from? Is it estimated? If so, how?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Examples of papers that dismiss the evidence term in Bayes rule:

“...where P(D|Z) is the likelihood of data D conditional on latent variable Z. For example, D might be an image patch (corrupted by sensory noise) and Z is the orientation of an edge in the patch. When the mage contrast is higher (lower sensory noise), or the display is viewed for longer (evidence accumulation), the likelihood of the data under the true orientation increases. The prior encodes the distribution of oriented edges in natural images (e.g., cardinal orientations are more common than oblique orientations). Taken together, the prior and likelihood can be understood as constituting a generative model—a recipe for generating observed data from latent variables. Bayes’ rule inverts this generative model to produce a belief about the latent variables after observing data.” (Gershman & Beck, 2017)

Gershman, S. J., & Beck, J. M. (n.d.). Complex Probabilistic Inference: From Cognition to Neural Computation. 17.

“The denominator P(x\_0 |x\_h ) is the probability of the observations given x\_h and is independent of x\_1. Hence it can simply be viewed as the normalizing factor Z\_1 needed so that the ‘‘posterior’’ probability P(x\_1 |x\_0 , x\_h ) is a probability distribution, i.e., equals 1 when summed over all values of x\_1 .” (Lee & Mumford, 2003)

Lee, T. S., & Mumford, D. (2003). Hierarchical Bayesian inference in the visual cortex. JOSA A, 20(7), 1434-1448.

“Bayesian inference is extremely versatile because it can be applied in myriad different situations. For example, one can generalize the example above to sequential Bayesian inference given inputs evolving over time: if I\_1 is the input received at time step 1, then P(X|I\_1 ) = k\_1 P(I\_1 |X)P(X), where k\_1 is the normalization constant.” (Rao, 2009)

d43i1s,"[D] I find a post in Quora (whether AI is statistics or not) from a PhD who says: ""Traditional statistical approach is naive, based on uneducated assumptions, constricted to outdated methods"". Is there truth to this argument?","Here is the full quote:

>I find there are 2 kinds of people who have entered the discourse on modern-day machine learning; those who embrace trial-and-error and those who take the traditional statistics approach, relying on upfront assumptions about what makes a good model. Those who embrace trial-and-error use techniques likes decisions trees, deep learning, ensembles and meta learning. Those who take the traditional approach often rely on methods like multiple and logistic regression.

>The thinking between the 2 camps is very different. Personally, I am a proponent of trial-and-error, focusing on optimization, meta-learning, heuristics, evolutionary approaches, etc. that let the data do the talking. I find the traditional statistical approach to be naive, based more on uneducated assumptions about the data and constricted to outdated methods. That being said, there is a resurgence of some Bayesian methods in machine learning that take a more parametric approach.

>So, when you say “is Artifical Intelligence just glorified statistics” the answer must be no. These are 2 very different camps which, while sharing much in common, have very different goals and techniques in mind. “AI” as we know it did not grow out of the statistics community.

>Machine learning lets nature, data and trial-and-error speak about the function that drives inputs to outputs in a complex system. Statisticians believe they can guess about this mechanism using best practices.

I'm interested to hear what people think of this text. The reason that I ask is that when I looked at it there's a lot of code that isn't shown in the text, there's a file which contains a class written by the author in order to use the text (abstracting some of the programming away). 

What I was interested in was what people here thought about the text as I am unsure whether it gets the balance of abstraction right. Because it's not only abstracting the programming away from the user by writing the class files, but it's (by design) abstracting some of the analytical methods away by focusing on the implementation of the methods using python. 

Does it do a good job of balancing these? 

I appreciate that it's not a graduate mathematical statistics text. I'm just curious what people think of it, if they've seen it.

bb9hij,Simplex algorithm for linear programming,"Hello everyone, 

Last semester I had a course on optimization models/methods. My prof encouraged everyone to build even the simplest of algorithms we discussed, from scratch, to test our knowledge and to explore these concepts from both math and computer science perspectives. 

I built the simplex algorithm from scratch in python 3. (I finished the first commit back in December, for reference.) Recently, a grad student in Turkey connected with me because he saw my post on medium and asked if I could add some functionality; he let me know that he'd be using it as a basis for a grad research project. Which was really cool to hear as someone who's relatively new to this domain. Hope this algorithm is useful to others as well.

9yspe8,For teachers: To focus on hand calculations or not?,"I've been teaching statistics in my psychology department at my college for over a decade. The undergraduate course is required for all psychology majors; it's a lab course with a TA running the lab. I have used a fairly standard approach, in the sense that I use a well-established textbook (now with online practice problems) and we introduce them to SPSS. Content goes from descriptive statistics to sampling distributions and inferential tests (t tests and ANOVA up to a two-way between subjects factorial ANOVA).

Semester after semester, most students show that with practice, they can match a data situation to an appropriate analysis, and can do the hand calculations relatively well (the usual silly math mistakes of course occur). But they regularly struggle with the abstract concepts - if I ask them what a confidence interval or a standard error tells us, or the difference between an alpha level and a p-value, or significance vs. effect size, they continue to flounder.

After years of this, I am re-thinking the value of spending so much time having them learn how to calculate t-tests and ANOVAs in particular by hand - it eats up easily half of our in-class instruction time, and they are never expected to do it again after the class is over. I believe there is some value in it, but it's not translating to deeper conceptual understanding which I believe is largely the point of doing it in the first place. It feels like it might be time to find other ways of exploring and conveying the concepts that will serve them well in reading articles, using statistics packages, taking the methodology course, etc. Plus, the time we save from not doing hand calculations may allow us to cover more topics like regression that I currently just don't have time for.

So, I'm interested in hearing whether others have experienced this in their courses and whether you have settled on an approach that seems to work better. Thanks for reading!

6j0jzb,I'm quitting my current position (as the only statistician in my company) for another job. What steps should I take to make sure that my replacement (which I probably won't be able to meet in-person) hits the ground running?,"I've been working on a research project for about a year now, but I've realized that it's time for me to move on.

So given that I probably won't be able to communicate face to face with my replacement, what sort of steps should I take to make sure that he/she doesn't start from scratch? Here's my current to-do list:

* Finish up all of my current work

* Thoroughly document all the important ""home made"" R functions that are used in my workflow

* Give an overview of the most relevant R libraries that are used in my workflow

* Write a document detailing the results from the project so far and feasible paths forward. Include some domain knowledge/intuitions about the data that is generated in our lab. The domain knowledge I'm unsure about because we have a large volume of material that is not yet analyzed, so my ""sample size"" so to say is not that large.

* Create a library with some statistical theory that might be unfamiliar to the new person 

* Be available through e-mail and possibly skype, and also offer some external assistance with the work itself in the ""transitionary"" period.

Statistics programs have left a hole that CS departments are exploiting very profitably, and much has been written about how ""data science"" initiatives often have few faculty from stats departments and many data science jobs go to people who can code (CS majors).

Understanding theory is very important, but it's really not acceptable in 2015 to have one's coding knowledge start and end at lm(y~x) (or even worse, PROC univariate).

1bsldxe,"[D] Do you share my pet-peeve with using nonsense time-series correlation to introduce the concept ""correlation does not imply causality""?","I wrote a text about something that I've come across repeatedly in intro to statistics books and content (I'm in a bit of a weird situation where I've sat through and read many different intro-to-statistics things).

[Here's a link to my blogpost.](https://open.substack.com/pub/unconfusion/p/against-using-nicholas-cage-movies?r=1vkdhx&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true) But I'll summarize the points here.

A lot of intro to statistics courses teach ""correlation does not imply causality"" by using funny time-series correlation from Tyler Vigen's [spurious correlation website](https://tylervigen.com/spurious/correlation/5837_the-number-of-movies-nicolas-cage-appeared-in_correlates-with_the-number-of-transportation-security-screeners-in-north-dakota). These are funny but I don't think they're perfect for introducing the concept. Here are my objections.

1. It's better to teach the difference between observational data and experimental data with examples where the reader is actually likely to (falsely or prematurely) infer causation.
2. Time-series correlations are more rare and often ""feel less causal"" than other types of correlations.
3. They mix up two different lessons. One is that non-experimental data is always haunted by possible confounders. The other is that if you do a bunch of data-dredging, you can find random statistically significant correlations. This double-lesson-property can give people the impression that a well replicated observational finding is ""more causal"".

xk8fdo,"[D] Why ""controlling for a variable doesn't (usually) work","I've long been fascinated by how so many fields (psychology, nutrition, etc.) use statistical associations to try to make causal arguments. Everyone knows correlation is not causation, but the typical approach in these fields is to ""control"" for all sorts of variables. Then, no one directly says they've proved causality, but they use words like ""risk factor"" that very strongly suggest it.

Anyway, I recently went down a long rabbit-hole trying to understand when these techniques might or might not work. After reading a bunch of Pearl's papers and an intro econometrics textbook, my impression was as follows:

1. You must control for everything that is causally upstream of the interaction you are investigating.

2. You must *not* control for anything that is causally downstream of the interaction you are investigating.

3. If there's any two-way causality, there's basically no hope.

4. There's a million other issues (linearity, noisy features, etc.)

The full post is here: https://dynomight.net/control/ I'd appreciate any thoughts on if this is correct. It seems very strange to me because the typical approach in areas like nutrition is to just control for *everything* without worrying about which control variables might be upstream/downstream/both.",54,27,dyno__might,2022-09-21 15:43:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/xk8fdo/d_why_controlling_for_a_variable_doesnt_usually/,0,statistics

This somehow made me also not able to publish in too good of journals - still ok though. Is it worth to go on ? Does it get any different ? I feel like I really want to collaborate more once I m done with my phd as I cannot be an expert in optimisation/stats etc and thousand different areas an once. I got loads of ideas but the time it takes me aquiring new knowledge in some areas is just overwhelming. It would be nice to be able to talk to experts who can tell you at least if your idea is worth going after or not. What I can show for at least is that I know how to get grant money. I got our institute about 120K for three years ( even if this might not be too much still a little proud).

mj19vp,"[D] Relationship between ""Association Rules"", ""Decision Trees"" and ""Clustering""","Recently, I have started reading about ""Association Rule Mining"" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning) - these algorithms are meant to look for ""associations"" between different combinations of variables. The classic example of association rule mining was that some store used these algorithms and discovered a unexpected relationship between beer and diapers.

My question relates to the following : in an indirect sense, it seems that the association rule algorithm is ""partitioning"" the data into small homogenous ""clusters"". 

This relates to another question I always had : it also seems to me that decision trees (also called ""recursive partitioning"") indirectly accomplish the role of ""supervised clustering"". Each terminal node of the decision tree (e.g. CART) can be seen as a ""cluster"" - and of course, a set of ""Boolean rules"" are generated by the decision tree that guide the data to each one of these clusters (i.e. the terminal nodes of the decision tree). In the example of supervised classification, each one of these terminal ""clusters"" is associated with the classes of the response variable. Of course, there is some element of probabilistic risk and heterogeneity associated with these clusters.

And finally, traditional clustering algorithms (e.g. k means) are usually fully unsupervised. Clustering algorithms assign each observation to a given cluster - and it is now the user's (tedious and difficult) job to determine what characteristics of these observations result in them being ""associated"" with each cluster. I.e. What is so special about observations in the same cluster? Which ranges of features result in observations being assigned to the same cluster?

Therefore, in a very abstract sense - could we say that there is some ""general similarities"" between these 3 algorithms : association rules, decision trees and clustering?",53,6,blueest,2021-04-03 04:24:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/mj19vp/d_relationship_between_association_rules_decision/,0,statistics

I am just trying to think of an example - suppose the data collection process for a certain experiment is fundamentally flawed. For example, you want to weigh people and based on their weight you predict if they have a certain disease. But you forgot to tell people to take off their shoes before the weigh themselves - some people are wearing heavy winter boots (since they were weighed in the winter), and some people are wearing sandals (since you weighed them in the summer). So if you were to make a statistical model for this data, you would falsely conclude certain relationships between weight and that disease. If anything, in a very whimsical sense, you could have tried to infer some relationship between footwear and this disease.

I know that this a silly example - but is there some term in statistics for ""the data not fully corresponding to the phenomena you want to study""?

128nhhi,[Q] What to do if residuals are not normally distributed (linear regression)?,"Hello folks,

I would like to calculate a simple linear regression in RStudio. To test the assumption of normally distributed residuals, I have calculated a Shapiro-Wilk test. Unfortunately, it shows a significant result, so that the prerequisite is not fulfilled.

Due to my sample size (N = 144), can I invoke the central limit theorem at this point and still reliably interpret the results of the hypothesis test? In principle, my hypothesis could also be tested using a simple correlation, for which I would not need normally distributed residuals, but the supervisor of my thesis seems to be a fan of using regressions.

As this is my first time learning about martingales, and seeing alternate proofs to already known results using them, I am wondering what more is there. So, am I overestimating martingales or are they really as strong as they seem to me? Is there some other tool that is even stronger or that can be used to obtain similar results in other settings?

10xp8b9,[Q] How is brownian motion used in modelling?,"Specifically I'm having trouble understanding the diffusion term. Without it we essentially have a OLS regression -- and if we subtract the line of best fit from the brownian motion to obtain the residuals, we should get a normally distributed ""noise"" term.

But if we were to generate our own brownian motion with the fitting mu and sigma, I don't see how it would produce a better fit to the data than a linear relationship, y=mx. I would expect that drawing random terms from a Gaussian in order to artificially create diffusion would average out to not having a noise term at all.

Similarly, if we have drift of 0, our parameterized brownian process would have little to no predictive power for the location of the particle in t+10 for example, other than providing upper and lower bounds than for where the particle could be.

n182ey,[D] is it common to use the ZIP code as a predictor variable in statistical models?,"Suppose you want to make a model that predicts if a student will drop out of university- you have historical information about many students and whether they dropped out or not. You also have access to the ZIP code (postal code) where they lived.

1) Is it common to actually the zip code as an input variable (probably not, since there are too many categories)? Or, maybe use the first 3 numbers of the zip code as an input variable?

2) I was always told to avoid using a predictor variable that has too many categories. Is there a mathematical reason behind this? From a mathematical standpoint: if your data has 1000 rows and one of your predictor has 450 categories - mathematically speaking, why might this harm your statistical model? I can understand it intuitively - having too many categories means too much information and your model might get ""confused"" - but is there a mathematical explanation?

First, I apologize if this question has already been answered. I couldn't find a useful answer through Google, so I'm here. A link to another thread would be awesome if such a thing already exists.

I'm wondering what some good resources are for learning basic-to-intermediate levels stats. I took a basic stats course about 3 years ago and I have more knowledge of Excel than the layperson, but very little knowledge relative to most (all?) of the people in this sub. Lately, I've become interested in sports data, mainly NBA, MLB, and NFL. 

Fast forward 3 years, I'm graduating in about a month and I have the summer to just work and study for the GRE. I'd like to learn more about statistics with the end goal of creating various statistical models for the major sports that I enjoy watching (and occasionally betting on). Right now, Random Forest models and Neural Network models are very intriguing, but I don't know where to gather the requisite knowledge to create those. I've read that I'll need to learn how to code, which is a welcome challenge.

TLDR: Any resources you have (YouTube channels, blogs, etc.) which can help me understand concepts that can be applied to creating statistical/analytical models would be greatly appreciated! Thank you all so much!

m9hbtz,[E][C] Will there be too many masters/phd level statisticians for number of jobs in analytics/stats/data science?,"Really entertaining going back to school to learn the math for an MS in Stats but very worried about market forces for those with statistical expertise. When I look for positions on LinkedIn using ""statistics"" as a key phrase, the results are rather limited. Expanding the search to include ""analytics"" returns more results since those positions want the quantitative tendencies but are not dead set on statistics alone. 

I've evaluated masters programs for business, CS, economics, finance, business analytics, computational mathematics, information systems, and statistics along with the prerequisites for each - all maintained in a spreadsheet that I live with daily. I've looked at numerous colleges, ranging from community college programs for the prerequisites to thesis based masters programs both locally and online. 

Out of all of the catalogs and curriculum plans, statistics is the only one I am really interested in. I'm more driven to analyze a dataset to infer outcomes or to gain an understanding than I am to build a system for someone else to use. I'm also familiar with rudimentary forms of planning and forecasting and would love a much deeper dive into regression techniques. 

My background is corporate finance + business intelligence/analytics and I really want to ""level up"" education wise. Been using SQL and python for years now coupled with an undergrad in accounting. My background qualifies me for FP&A, analytics, and business intelligence positions, but not for anything requiring serious math chops (data science, advanced analytics, traditional statistician positions, etc.). I would like to eventually make my way to something involving more statistics and analysis. 

Should this be a legitimate fear of mine, that a masters level education in statistics wouldn't yield a favorable employment outcome? Is this an irrational fear at this point, because the explosion of data over the past decade is meant to continue on the growth of analytics and statistics positions? The BLS forecasts 14,300 more statistician positions over the next decade which doesn't seem like much, but the growth rate is faster than other fields.

I’m familiar with Bayesian stats, including some simple MCMC techniques, but mainly for simple tasks like A/B testing. This seems like a decently large sized leap. 

First, what’s the likelihood function? The Wikipedia article shows a function that looks like a multi variate Gaussian...but it’s missing some things, like the precision matrix or inverse covariance matrix in the exp term.

Likewise, the model sounds doesn’t seem to explicitly model the bias term. Is that right?

I’m not sure what priors to use, however, a Laplace prior sounds decent (for the weights) and an inverse gamma sounds quite popular for variance. Any recommendations?

Lastly, is there an MCMC method that’s more/less appropriate for this task? I try to avoid Gibbs as I’m trash at deriving conditional distributions by hand.. But there are a number of conditionals involved in the equation, so that might not be possible to avoid.

he18bj,"[Q] Am I ""on the right track"" about the bayesian state of mind?","I'm new to the Bayesian state of mind. What I've gathered thus far is: 

(1) instead of treating parameters as scalars, we can model them as random variables (very meta). To my understanding, this is neat because we don't rely on central limit theorem to create confidence intervals; the posterior ""says it all."" (I have no idea what credible intervals are, but gather that they are analogous to confidence intervals. If my understanding of the posterior's purpose is correct, I'm unclear on why credible intervals would even be necessary.)

(2) Calculating the posterior is usually a difficult or impossible task. However, there are three main ""tricks"": (A) you can use conjugate priors to sidestep this computation entirely (B) you can use MCMC techniques to generate simulated posterior samples or (C) you can use MAP to find the posterior expectation rather than the distribution itself (which might still be useful.)

(3) Bayesian statistics is great for online learning, multi-arm bandits, A/B testing, etc. where you need to explore/exploit probability space systematically. Frequentist statistics might not be as adept at these sort of tasks but I'm not sure why.

9kyhng,[Research] Practical Markov modelling for continuous value time series - by estimating joint distribution of a few neighboring values with high degree polynomial,"While predicting even direction of change in financial time series is nearly impossible, it turns out we can successfully predicts at least probability distribution of succeeding values (much more accurately than as just Gaussian in ARIMA-like models): https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04119

We first normalize each variable to nearly uniform distribution on [0,1] using estimated idealized CDF (Laplace distribution turns out to give better agreement than Gauss here): 

**x_i (t) = CDF(y_i (t))** has nearly uniform distribution on [0,1]

Then looking at a few neighboring values, they would come from nearly uniform distribution on [0,1]^d if uncorrelated - we fit polynomial as corrections from this uniform density, describing statistical dependencies. Using orthonormal basis {f} (polynomials), MSE estimation is just:

**rho(x) = sum_f a_f f(x)** for **a_f = average of f(x) over the sample**

Having such polynomial for joint density of d+1 neighboring values, we can substitute d previous values (or some more sophisticated features describing the past) to get predicted density for the next one - in kind of order d Markov model on continuous values.

While economists don't like machine learning due to lack of interpretability and control of accuracy - this approach is closer to standard statistics: its coefficients are similar to cumulants (also multivariate), have concrete interpretation, we have some control of their inaccuracy. We can also model their time evolution for non-stationary time series, evolution of entire probability density. 

Slides with other materials about this general approach: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7u6f2zpreph6j8o/rapid.pdf

Example of modeling statistical dependencies between 29 stock prices (y_i (t) = lg(v_i (t+1)) - ln(v_i (t)), daily data for last 10 years): ""11"" coefficient turns out very similar to correlation coefficient, but we can also model different types of statistical dependencies (e.g. ""12"" - with growth of first variable, variance of the second increases/decreases) and their time trends: https://i.imgur.com/ilfMpP4.png",49,4,jarekduda,2018-10-03 05:53:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/9kyhng/research_practical_markov_modelling_for/,0,statistics

1bodiel,It feels difficult to have a grasp on Bayesian inference without actually “doing” Bayesian inference [Q],"Im a MS stats student whose taken Bayesian inference in undergrad, and now will be taking it in my MS. While I like the course, I find that these courses have been more on the theoretical side, which is interesting, but I haven’t even been able to do a full Bayesian analysis myself. If someone said to me to derive the posterior for various conjugate models, I could do it. If someone said to me to implement said models, using rstan, I could do it. But I have yet to be able to take a big unstructured dataset, calibrate priors, calibrate a likelihood function, and make some heirarchical mixture model or more “sophisticated” Bayesian models. I feel as though I don’t get a lot of experience doing Bayesian analysis. I’ve been reading BDA3, roughly halfway through it now, and while it’s good I’ve had to force myself to go through the Stan manual myself to learn how to do this stuff practically. 

I’ve thought about maybe trying to download some kaggle datasets and practice on here. But I also kinda realized that it’s hard to do this without lots of data to calibrate priors, or prior experiments.

Does anyone have suggestions on how they got to practice formally coding and doing Bayesian analysis?  ",50,24,Direct-Touch469,2024-03-26 17:24:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/1bodiel/it_feels_difficult_to_have_a_grasp_on_bayesian/,0,statistics
