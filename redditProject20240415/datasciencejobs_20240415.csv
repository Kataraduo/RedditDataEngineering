el6cgo,Glassdoor sucks,"I use to like Glassdoor. I trusted their data, I trusted their estimates. Then I got my first job

My company is very large but new to data science and we have, across time, hired 8 people in data roles total (and 6 were having a role similar to a data scientist at some point). Glassdoor says that they have 10 data science salaries. and lists their average salary about 20% lower than my expectation of our lowest paid employee (I know 3 of the 6 salaries)

I remember when I started, I was our first data analyst/scientist and glassdoor said they had 2 salaries listed (I was told there was 2 prior postings that were not filled). 

I dont know if glassdoor has people entering fake data or if they estimate their data (possibly based on the number of job postings?) and push false values to give some sort of trust but I no longer have any level of trust in their system.",47,17,FanOfFatLions,2020-01-07 04:34:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScienceJobs/comments/el6cgo/glassdoor_sucks/,0,datasciencejobs

fa3bnp,Data Science Interview Prep for FAANG,"Hi,

I want to get advice/suggestion on my study plan for FAANG Data Science interviews. Please go through my study plan comment if you feel I'm missing something important or doing something irrelevant ? I have few specific questions listed at the bottom.

I'm also looking for study buddies, so DM me if you are in same boat and interested in studying together. We can share daily progress, interview each other and most importantly motivate to study lol.

**Background**I'm working as a Data Scientist with a tech consulting firm. My project experience has been around building production ready customer churn/retention models using classification and time series ensembles. Prior to full time role, I did my Masters in Information systems (Focus on statistics and machine learning).

**Study Plan**I had set a 6 months study goal for myself starting from Jan, 2020. On average I study 25-30 hours a week outside my full time job.

**Progress made**I have covered following MOOCs till now

1. Statistics & Probability - Introduction to probability Stats 110x, Harvard [https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home)
2. Linear Algebra & Calculus - Mathematics for Machine Learning [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning)
3. Machine Learning - [https://mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai/) (great resource, highly recommended! )
4. **Currently learning**Deep Learning - Andrew Ng course ([https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning))

**Next steps**

1. I'm planning to get more hands on from now. My goal is to compete in atleast 5 Kaggle competitions in next 2 months.
2. I am fairly comfortable with SQL, planning to solve all leetcode right questions before interviews.

**Questions**

1. I'm interested in expanding my NLP skillset. I have done one chatbot project in school but not touched NLP in last one year. I would like to do couple of mini projects with NLP involved which can help me during the interviews. Please suggest, how should I go about it?
2. Considering I'm aiming for FAANG, Data structures/Algos will be part of at least one technical interview. Now the issue is, I haven't taken DSA courses in school (no CS background ), but I'm fairly comfortable with python.How should I prepare for the coding interviews at FAANG? I don't want to jump into leetcode without building fundamentals. Please suggest, effective strategy.
3. I see many Data Scientist at FAANG are only focused on product analytics (SQL, visualization, ETL) and most of Machine Learning work is done by Research Scientists.I had considered Data Scientist, Analytics (FB position) kind of roles but I'm quite inclined towards Machine Learning (mathematics side).Since my background is neither too coding heavy nor too mathematics/research heavy, I want to get suggestions what other steps should I take in order to improve my candidacy as DS at FAANG.

c3a4bq,Looking for entry level Data Scientist or Data Analyst positions?,"The data science job market is getting extremely competitive. Just having a certification or claiming to know R or Python no longer cuts it. If you do want to stand out in the market and get hired quickly here is what you can do: 

* Optimize your LinkedIn profile and your resume, so employers can quickly assess your fit for their hiring needs.
* Check out Upwork and even startups in your area. You may start off lower, but you will accelerate much faster. 
* network strategically. If you are reaching out to your network to ask for a job, be focused. It will be easier to get results. Networking takes more time, but works better. 
* Have a unique portfolio. Kaggle competitions are great, but unless you are in the top 10% , you need to translate how participation helped you master datascience skills and apply algorithms. DIY projects are a much better bet.

Background: I'm a 23 year old Graduate. My degree wasn't very data-focused, aside from one third year module in which Excel was used extensively with a data set to perform calculations (not really advanced stuff though). I do have experience presenting data (research findings) to audiences and in reports, and consider myself to be reasonably good at that side of things.

emimq8,Advice for How To Get a Data Science Job,"Hello,

I've been job searching for over 2 years. I took a break from job searching because I got rather depressed from the rejection but I started up my job search again in November of 2019. I graduated with a bachelors in statistics. My plan was to get a data science or data analyst job and then pursue a masters online part-time (I went back to school in my 30s so I really miss working). I'm having a really challenging time landing interviews that translate into a job offer. When I was initially job searching, I did get some interviews but now that I am back into my job search, I haven't landed one interview. I went to some job fairs for women in tech (as I am female). I am really starting to wonder if my gender is an issue. I mean, I know I am competent. I have the skills. I studied python as part of my degree and took a machine learning course at school. I do feel I have more to learn in terms of machine learning but I just want to know what should I do to land a job? Is my stats background a perceived problem as most people seem to have comp science backgrounds, although really math is what drives machine learning so I don't think it should be an issue. Is it because I am new and have no professional work experience? What can I do to achieve my goal to get an entry level data science job?

I have researched companies and sent them my resume. I'm not just relying on job postings and have been doing networking. Currently I am doing some volunteer work but it is mostly survey analysis. 

I live in Toronto, Canada. I heard that it is rather competitive. I am willing to relocate but I don't know where else in Canada I could move since Toronto seems to be the centre for tech in Canada. 

What job search techniques work? Should I focus more on informational interviews? If so, what kind of people should I target? DS or DS team leads? HR?

bjnhr9,"Looking for data scientists who are interested in launching a startup for ""genomics/nutritional data analysis/better AI/medicine data analysis""?","**Introduction:**  

  

I'm deep learning engineer who deals with image.  

  

I have understanding and knowledge on biology and neuroscience, nutrition, some medicine fields.  

  

I would like to do service which provides better suggestion for nutritional supplementary products  

using data science on personal medicine data, genomics, and collaborating with orthomolecular medicine experts and institutes.  

  

================================================================================  

**What I would like to do:**  

  

Hopefully, I would like to do wide and integrative range of medicine project which ultimately manages the health status of people, for example,  

  

1..check the health status and get health data and analyze it.  

  

2.. find better life style, dietary, supplements  

  

3.. those decisions will be managed by AI system, statistical model, data science as well as supervision of medicine experts  

  

4.. collaborate with fundamental researchers to find better understanding on the mechanism of nature  

Currently, there is often paradoxical conclusions in the even professional papers.  

For example, half of paper says eating 3 eggs is good for the health, and other half says it's bad.  

And half of papers says drinking coffee is good, and other half says it's bad.  

Some papers also say having cigarette is good for health cause it can reduce the stress of body.  

I don't doubt the capability of researchers but think this issue comes from various reasons; lack of budget, lack of research time, 

and human can't consider tons of factors at the same time.  

This is the point which I think big data and strong computing power driven medicine project can help this limitation out.  

Big data and strong computing power are the technologies which hadn't existed before. They're new technology and environment.  

It's obvious there will be advantages and paradigm shift and game changer on the companies which use those technologies in good way.

  

5.. more focus on preventive medicine, and collaborate with modern medicine, to help the severity of the disease,

and to check progress of disease, how patients response to the treatment prescribed by the experts, how prognosis will be.

  

================================================================================  

But I might start to analyze nutritional status data of patients, which is obtained saliva, blood, hair, nail, etc. 

And doctors will prescribe recommendation for nutritional supplements as auxiliary treatment.   

And I will create the model which analyze that status and which can evaluate how those prescription works as clear and objective numerical figures.  

&#x200B;

Since there are tons of nutritional factors, tons of disease, tons of status, it's difficult to find optimal recommendation for even medical doctors.  

Hope it can be helped by computer technology.  

&#x200B;

And doing this, I would like to expand kind of data which we can analyze towards genomic data, pathology slide image,   

antioxidant status, inflammation status, microbe status in the gut, etc and hope to be able to analyze their interactions.  

  

And I would like to make model which detects abnormal signal from big data as well as better AI system like artificial general intelligence.  

But AGI is just long term life project which is unsure if it can be created as most challenge project to even top AI companies.  

But I just hope that attempts will help the short term goal because developing AGI is the attempts to create new algorithm.  

  

To do that, first I need to find doctor who can collaborate with us.  

  

================================================================================  

**Project background:**  

  

I have read a lot of research papers on inflammation, oncology, autoimmune disease, diabetes, immunology, etc,  

which say the importance of nutritional aspects, for example,  

  

\- New perspectives of curcumin in cancer prevention  

[www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693758/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693758/)  

  

\- Selenium and Thyroid Disease: From Pathophysiology to Treatment  

[www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5307254/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5307254/)  

  

The idea comes from the fact that our body has elaborate curing mechanism  

And that curing mechanism is too complicated, and automatic feedback mechanism which has been optimized for millions of years to imitate them by humans.  

Even if modern medicines can't fully and actually cure every diseases if you know how the drugs work in terms of pharmacology; specifically key-lock theory, 

it's amazing that body itself can cure the disease as long as it's not too Irreversibly late.  

  

================================================================================  

**Skills which are supposed to be used to deal with the project:**  

  

\- Bayesian Probabilistic Model  

\- Probabilistic Graphical Model  

\- Monte Carlo Tree Search  

\- Reinforcement Learning  

\- Neuroscience mechanism based AI coding  

\- Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Visualization  

\- Deep Learning (CNN, RNN, Classification, Linear regression)  

\- Machine Learning (Supervised, Unsupervised, GAN)  

\- Fast responsive for discussion via email or private channel  

&#x200B;

================================================================================  

**What we can start**  

\- Discuss what specific project we need to do  

\- Discuss how to build the team up  

\- Try public data science competitions via Kaggle, Grand Challenge",17,4,youngmindev,2019-05-01 22:35:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScienceJobs/comments/bjnhr9/looking_for_data_scientists_who_are_interested_in/,0,datasciencejobs

as title, I am a stay home mom who would like to  steer my career path into data science and hope to get some advices from people who are working at this field.
I had a master in experimental psychology, I learned matlab before and SPSS is the program I use to run statistical tests, After i graduate, i worked at IPSOS / OMD media company as a research executive for few years, i didn’t do a lot of coding by then, most of time were about reporting and projects managing. 
Now I have been away from work for almost 4 years and also I am from taiwan, never worked at America before (my job or education history were all in Taiwan), I would really like to find a way to prove and build my skill set and hopefully to get a job in America once my kids are ready to go to school(in one or two years probably).

I am thinking of springboard data science job guaranteed course, but my husband is really against to it (tuition is too high and not sure about the job guaranteed), I also took a codecademy pro intensive course before....but maybe not enough? so any other suggestions where or how should i plan out this career move?

I have an interview with an organization for a Data Science position in the next few days. One component of the interview will be doing a ""live"" analysis. The recruiter told me that the interviewer will provide me with a data set and I will have to perform a statistical analysis on the data. 

I am nervous about doing this sort of this live and want to be prepared as possible because this is a dream job and dream organization. How ""deep"" should statistical analysis go (keep in mind this part of the interview is approximately 1 hour)?

To me, the position does not seem to be a data analyst, rather a data scientist position. I am thinking about asking them to at least increase the salary by 10%  (to barely match what I am getting now as an engineer) and changing the title to data scientist.

9v8zni,Help needed: McKinsey data scientist technical test,"Hello, guys. My first time posting here. I just got an invitation to finish an online coding test for the data scientist position at McKinsey. It is a 2-hour test with 3 coding questions from Hacker Rank. I did some quick search online and got panic- the questions look difficult! Does anyone here have taken such test? The deadline is two weeks later. Any experience/advice on the preparation of the test would be highly appreciated.

A little about my background: I just finished my Ph.D. and my thesis is on computational fluid dynamics. I can code in C, Python and a little SQL and have some experience in building machine learning models. But most of my coding skills are self-taught. I learn what I need in my research and I have almost no experience in coding tests(the only one is the C programming final in college I guess).  I think my biggest problem is that I lack a general picture of different kinds of algorithms and I’m easily got stuck on topics I’m not familiar with.",12,9,dragonrushhhhh,2018-11-08 10:47:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScienceJobs/comments/9v8zni/help_needed_mckinsey_data_scientist_technical_test/,0,datasciencejobs

56elzz,Networking for a Data Science job,"Hello,

I have a long career in research and analysis in the financial markets space. I realised the new things happening under the term ""Data science"" is essentially what I have been doing for a long time, albiet much more complex. I have since then spent about a 1.5 years studying new things like R, Python, NoSQL, Machine learning algos etc [[and to be honest, I suck at it.]]

Howver I do feel that I carry lot of potential for employers in terms of my experience in wrangling / selection / analyzing the data. But I feel very intimidated by the fact that I am not a Master of any of these new tools. I am learning but Its inconsequential until rubber truly hits the ground. I realise this is not a good way to get a job in Data Science.

My request is:

1. If you are a data science jobs employer would you hire a guy like me with budding data science skills but good knowledge & experience of actual analysis

2. Any suggestions of how to place / position myself among the networking managers when I am compared with hard-core techies who have very good Python / R skills

g6pw76,Hiring a data engineer for the first time (no idea what I'm doing) — does this listing sound alright?,"I'm trying to fill a pretty neat role in Hamburg, Germany. It's a two-year gig in a new office within a beautiful old museum. The Data engineer will be working with sensitive **cultural data pertaining to colonial art theft and restitution**. It pays **€61k** which is just above Glassdoor's average rate for data engineers in Hamburg.

This will be translated into German but before that's done, are there any **red-flags** that stand out? Do the requirements sound appropriate? I'm not a data engineer and would love to hear if it looks attractive/feasible/etc.

&#x200B;

**Requirements:**

* Degree in computer science, a related technical field, or equivalent practical experience.
* 2-4 years of industry experience with general programming languages (such as Python, Java, Scala) in the context of API interaction and data processing.
* Experience working with various kinds of APIs (especially RESTful ones) and data extraction.
* Experience with data querying, schema definition, and complex databases.
* Experience with ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines and programmatic automation.
* Experience working with tricky and unclean data sets.
* Experience with data exploration.
* Experience with version control on Github.
* Interest in working with sensitive cultural data!

**Bonus skills and experience:**

* Experience with robust data processing and pipeline tools such as Spark, Kafka, Dataflow, Airflow, Hadoop, etc.
* Data science experience in NLP (natural language processing) and machine learning.
* BSD Unix / Linux user.
* Knowledge of professional software engineering practices for the software development life cycle (SDLC), including coding standards, code reviews, source control management, build processes, and testing.

**Responsibilities and tasks include:**

* Translate data into research insights and questions and, on the other hand, work with researchers to answer them.
* Programmatically access differently-formatted APIs from various domestic and international institutions and digital collections.
* Collect and render accessible samples of this data for research and study by the team collectively.
* Co-development of more robust data pipelines for automated data retrieval.
* Attend weekly meetings to provide updates and give feedback.
* Encouraged to experiment with tools and methods relevant to the project and tasks at hand.

**Working environment and expectations:**

It is crucial for the data engineer to be open to experimenting with data as well as learning new development tools and frameworks. This is a green field project with limited supervision and high autonomy — as such, an interest in the cultural significance of the project is very important. The data engineer will be working with a research team in Hamburg alongside museum experts and collaborating with a remote design/development team lead and therefore will be expected to document and communicate work openly with team. The engineer will be afforded unique freedom in choosing what tools to use for data processing pipeline development.

ev6lh4,From Business to Data Science. Is it worth the shift?,"Hello. I’m a newbie here and I figured there are no better people to ask about life decisions than a reddit group — simply because they’re cutthroat and honest. But please be nice to me, I’m new here after all and just want your humble opinion. 

I come from a real estate developer background and I’ve been wanting to shift to Tech industry but I don’t know how. I love working for a developer, doing land acquisitions, deal structures and project management. It’s like playing Sims but in real life where you get to decide if this portion of land will become a mall, residential condo, park etc. While it’s really rewarding, I now find the work just way too exhausting for someone who has a new set of priorities — being a new mom to a wonderful boy. Possibly for that reason and that real estate being an industry that’s highly dependent on a favorable economy and also the fact that Tech has sought my interest long ago but just cannot shift, I thought of pursuing Data Science. I feel this most complements my background. (I have MBA and been practicing in corporate business for almost 10 years.) So given that, I resigned my job and enrolled to this bootcamp for 6 months. I feel I have to do this in order for me to make that big shift. To feel equipped at the very least.

Now, my big question is: Is a career in Data Science worth it?

fmeywg,Major career fork question; need advice,"Hello fellow dat scientists!

I work in a small ~80 person defense company. I do ML research for cool applications, write physics algorithms, and do general engineer. However, I also wear tons of hats because we’re so small. I write proposals, give briefings, and perform day to day operations. As a result, about 40% of my time is actual technical work and that 40% is distributed across multiple projects.

I am paid extremely fairly and the company is awesome, but I’ve been here for 5 years and I’m scared of stagnation. I’m also about to (I.e I need to stay to receive) a top secret clearance, which can lead to new and interesting opportunities.

I have an offer from a brand name (think fruit) company as a data scientist that offers a similar salary adjusting for cost of living. 

Is it worth taking this new opportunity for the golden name on resume and forgo my employee owned company and the clearance? Should I try to get new experience at different places?

9c634p,Astrophysics PhD to to Data science - best way to do this?,"Ok this may come across a desperate plea and a bit of a rant, but I'll try my best to avoid both of those things!

So I recently graduated with a PhD in astrophysics. I've known for quite some time that I want to leave academia and towards the end of my degree I tried to develop as many transferable data analysis/science skills as possible to hopefully make the transition into data science after. But... despite applying for a tonne of both data science and data analytics roles I've gotten zilch. 

&#x200B;

In my degree I spent most of my time coding in C and python, coded a couple of numerical algorithms for the mathematical side of things to get a lot of my results, and used some regression techniques. I also used some bash scripting and Python packages (numpy, pandas) to clean my data, visualise the results etc etc. 

Other than that, due to the nature of the project I was given (which was a shitshow for many reasons, and I was not allowed to change it despite pointing the flaws out many times to my advisor) I didn't do much else in the way of data science/programming/machine-learning/big-data that many astro PhDs can usually boast about at the end of their degrees. 

Of course, my results and conclusions were enough to churn out a couple of academic articles (the requirement to graduate) and hey, presto! 4 years later: PhD. 

&#x200B;

Now I'm at a loss what to do with my career - I didn't do enough stats and probability to go into analytics, not enough coding to go into software engineering, not enough machine learning to go into data science.

Does anybody have any advice on where to go from here? I'm thinking about doing one of those science 2 data science courses where they take in science PhDs and transform them into data scientists in a matter of weeks. What do you guys think of those? And can anyone suggest a good one?

&#x200B;

Final rant: I'm sick of people telling me ""Oh you have an astrophysics degree, you can get a job anywhere""... this is just so not the case

i7kk73,[Hiring] DS needed for analyzing credit scoring algorithms in Cambodia,"Pay:

$70 USD/hr - 15 hours per week until contract finishes. Pay off that CC debt or buy that shiny new expensive camera drone to fulfill your secret vlogging desire.

&#x200B;

Description:

Extract data from Google Sheets customer ""database"" into a (real) PostgresQL database in Google Cloud. We have a developer who can help you with all the connections and endpoints you may need for any operations. You will be given access to our raw customer data in google sheets and a direct connection to our production database to run queries on. (don't worry, we're not using that database for anything yet)

&#x200B;

Clean data: ensure that any data disparities or inaccuracies have been resolved, staff members will be available for you to resolve any detected issues

&#x200B;

Make sure that inter-dependencies between individual data points are clearly understood (example: GLEE depends on marital status, dependents, and income)

&#x200B;

Make sure that data is being incorporated into analysis correctly (i.e. appropriately assess data points associated with fraudulent applications, etc.)

&#x200B;

Make sure the data is being analyzed in a manner that incorporates the fact that there are key differences between the underlying loan products for which customers are making repayments: 

\- uncollateralized vs collateralized (conceptually lower risk because secured),

\- “starter” uncollateralized loans ($100/1 month) for customers with no credit history vs other uncollateralized loans ($101-$750) for customers with credit history

\- Loan durations range between 1-9 months for uncollateralized, and up to 36 for collateralized: number of repayments can not be compared apples-to-apples between loans of different duration

&#x200B;

Make sure the data is being analyzed in a manner that incorporates changing credit underwriting practices, and shifting macroeconomics

&#x200B;

Loan vintages: 

Our credit scoring algorithm has evolved over time, so some loans that were previously approved would no longer be approved under current scoring, i.e. need to look at data based on the same scoring system rather than at the time of approval COVID-19 economic downturn may affect recent loan performance, though if a customer could prove they had been economically disadvantaged by the pandemic we will have closed out the current loan and re-issued as a “rescheduled” loan with easier repayment terms

&#x200B;

Answering key questions - Phase 1: the bad

What customer characteristics correlate with poor loan performance (>15 days late monthly loan repayments or loan defaults)

&#x200B;

The “action” we would take based on this analysis is to score whichever characteristics indicate poor loan performance in a way that would decrease loans to customers with those characteristics

&#x200B;

Answering key questions - Phase 2: the good

What customer characteristics correlate with good loan performance (ontime or early monthly loan repayments)

&#x200B;

The “action” Boost would take based on this analysis is to score whichever characteristics indicate good loan performance in a way that would increase loans to customers with those characteristics",9,9,None,2020-08-11 03:49:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScienceJobs/comments/i7kk73/hiring_ds_needed_for_analyzing_credit_scoring/,0,datasciencejobs

c8iini,Ex Actuary and Software Entrepreneur Wanting to Pursue Data Science,"I’m thinking about making a career switch into data science.

I have BSc degrees in mathematics and marketing, and my MSc is in mathematics.  For a number of years I worked in the insurance industry as an underwriter and then later as an actuary. I left the insurance industry to start a mobile software company. We recently closed the company, so now I’m plotting my next career move.

I’ve been learning Python and have already built one project at my current job that uses pandas, beautifulsoup, requests, matplotlib, and a few other libraries. I have advanced Excel/VBA knowledge, and to a lesser extent I’m familiar with SQL, R, Ruby, and a few other languages that could be relevant.

I live in the Bay Area and am in my early/mid 30s, so I’d prefer to avoid going back to school; however, I learn well on my own and have been enjoying working in Python.

Am I at a point where I could start applying for jobs? Or should I spend a more time learning?

l9yswl,Should I expect data structure or algorithms come up during DS interview(undergrad internship in the US)? And is it a good idea to ask my recruiter about this?,I have an interview coming up in like 3 days and this will be my first interview ever! I felt so lucky that it's a FAANG company but because I don't have any prior experience I really worry I might fuck up. The position is labeled SWE but it's at a data team and the job description mentions nothing like algorithm or data structure. Instead it says data visualization and data processing. I guess they are not gonna ask stuff like red black trees or dijkstra's? Should I email the recruiter and asks about what kind of questions will come up? Or is asking them is a sign of not understanding the job description well?!

I am a recent graduate and I applied for a job. I got an interview and I got rejected. I asked for the feedback and the HR told me that other candidates were more qualified due to the projects that they did or certificates. She also suggested that I do a short degree to have a better chance in job search.
I asked her if it is possible to consider my application for an internship instead of a full-time entry-level data scientist and she said that I should apply for an internship when it is posted on their website.
Is it a good move if I email the manager of the role I applied for earlier that I would like to work as an intern and tell him that the reason that I got rejected was because of a lack of high-level projects in my resume?

fi9jox,I am hopeless in my job search. Would you mind taking a look at my resume to see if you have any suggestions?,"&#x200B;

A little background about me - I am a first-generation Bangladeshi American and the first to attend a college. While pursuing my higher education (A.S in Computer Science, B.S in Applied Mathematics, M.S in Data Science), I worked as a bartender for 7 years to support my family in NYC. 

I have graduated in December and I have been applying since the start of the year. However, I have received only one phone screening.  I do not have any formal work experience. Before starting college, I took a break from studies and worked at a fraud prevention company as an office administrator. One of my tasks was to collect data and that's how I became interested in the field of Data Science. 

If you guys could look at my resume and tell me how I can improve my chances of getting hired, I would appreciate it a lot. It has been a while since I have worked. I feel hopeless and I don't want to go back to working as a bartender after working so hard to get my degrees. I am even being denied of internships. 

Once again, thank you so much for your time. I humbly appreciate it.

dpsd7h,Dallas vs. Chicago for data scientists.,"My wife and I are faced with a choice to move to either Dallas or Chicago. She will be working for Amazon as an operations manager starting June 2020, and her family lives in Chicago. I have been a data scientist for more than 2.5 years now. She would obviously prefer Chicago, as it is near her family but she'd be willing to move to Dallas if it is good for my career. I know that Dallas is on the rise right now, but there seems to be no information out there on how much data scientists with experience comparable to mine are earning.   
I'm hoping this sub will give some insight. 

Particularly I'm interested in:

1. Rough salary ranges in both cities for PhD data scientists with over two years experience, preferably in NLP
2. Data science opportunities comparisons between two cities
3. Cost of living comparison, as I know Dallas has gotten a bit more expensive over the past few years. I'm suspecting it's gotten similar to Chicago. 

Important to mention also that the options for the warehouses in Chicago are Monee, IL and Kenosha, WI. This means that we will have to live in the surbubs and won't necessarily get the city feel even if we're in Chicago (which sucks).",7,7,None,2019-10-31 19:15:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScienceJobs/comments/dpsd7h/dallas_vs_chicago_for_data_scientists/,0,datasciencejobs

ltkyim,"[Hiring] Machine learning job: Data Scientist / Operational Researcher at Tesco (London, United Kingdom)","About the role
At Tesco, our Data Science team focuses on modelling complex business problems and deploying data products at scale. Our work spans across multiple areas including physical stores, online, supply chain, marketing and Clubcard, where we encourage rotation amongst our Data Scientists so they can gain expertise in different subjects. 

We work on several domains and problem types: online, pricing, security, fulfilment, distribution, property, IoT and computer vision are just some. Our team members spend 10% of their week on learning and personal development. Multiple academic collaborations enrich the team expertise; knowledge-sharing events are regular. Furthermore, we have got a great work-life balance, team days and relaxed but engaging culture.
You will be responsible for

This is a hands-on position where you will need to leverage your analytical mindset to find solutions to complex problems. As either a Data Scientist or Senior Data Scientist, you will need to understand difficult business problems and prototype solutions with minimal support. Apply, modify and design algorithms and mathematical models to solve business problems is a core component of the role. Our data scientists will need to be able to validate, document and present the solution approaches and performances, as well as communicate complex solutions in a clear, understandable way to non-experts. Data Scientists are also responsible for promoting data science across Tesco and promote Tesco across the external Data Science community. Finally, as a Data Scientist or Senior Data Scientist, you will be expected to drive innovation and take ownership of aspects of the project development, help the Principal and Lead Scientists and the Product Managers manage the relationships with the business stakeholders and mentor/supervise junior members of the team and/or interns.

You will need
We are looking for ambitious individuals with a mix of mathematical optimisation, programming and statistics skills. The role requires that you have an extensive background in Operational Research. A track record in designing and modifying advanced exact, heuristic, or metaheuristic algorithms is essential. You should be enthused to apply these techniques in a commercial or industrial setting, and encourage collaboration and communication between teams. Project and stakeholder management experience is preferred.

An ideal candidate will have a scientific mentality with the ability to ask the right questions, as well as answer them. A doctoral degree in an area of operational research or similar equivalent industrial experience is preferable, as well as a solid understanding of mathematics and statistical principles. Finally, strong programming skills are essential (Java and Python are preferred) as well as familiarity with software engineering best practices (such as version control, OOP, unit testing, CI/CD) and cloud technologies.

About us
Our vision here at Tesco is to become every customer's favourite way to shop, whether they are at home, out shopping, on the move, anywhere in the world.

In order to enable our vision, we strive to simplify operations for our Colleagues, Partners & Vendors to enable efficient trade.

Everything is underpinned by our continuous drive for the best tools and technology to deliver our vision. We’re driving innovation and transforming our Technology to become the world’s leading retailer.

We need people who share our ambition to deliver for our stakeholders. Passionate and confident people willing to take the initiative and drive us forwards. In return, we offer excitement, a great team, an excellent benefits package, and significant career development opportunities.

Joining us means playing a part in defining; building and launching an ambitious roadmap of digital products that could affect the lives of millions of people over the years to come.

l4ou4o,"[Hiring] Creative Data Journalist / Data Designer / Data Analyst, Remote","Do you have a passion for telling stories with data? We’re looking for individuals who excel in working with data from many different sources and are relentless in finding the story for the masses. If you’ve ever wanted to experiment with new ways to tell stories with obscure and exciting company or third-party data, we have a place for you.

**Your day to day:**  


You will be managing the end-to-end completion of data-led digital marketing campaigns - creating content ideas, researching and collating datasets on various topics, and coordinating a team of writers, graphic designers, data scientists, developers and research assistants. You will be working with a diverse range of types of data-driven campaigns - industry studies, surveys, calculators and interactive tools, dashboards that build the trust/authority of the campaigns you deliver.   


This is the ideal role for someone who understands the power of data-driven stories, has a technical or journalistic background, has maybe also worked as a freelancer or is simply a university graduate/student, and is looking to have an engaging job working with interesting companies. Instead of 6 Zooms a day, you get to actually do what you are passionate about - **working on exciting data stories.**  


**Other than meetings and due dates — you work when you want to. This position is result/outcome based. No micromanaging here.**   


You might get pinged on Tuesday at 8am, but you aren't expected to be on all the time. No one produces 8 hours straight a day, breaks are healthy, life happens, and sometimes sleeping an extra hour makes a world of difference. We ask for a 24 hour turnaround time with emails and messages. As long as work is done on time or early, your time isn't our business. We operate efficiently and in a “asynchronous” structure which we believe is the future of work.

It will be fully remote and there will be minimal meetings. 

You will definitely be learning on the job, but you should come ready to hit the ground running.

### About FrontPage Data:

We help companies to generate interesting topics for content, analyze and visualize their data, then transform these insights into quality content marketing that spreads. Our content tells a story through data and explains what the findings mean to readers.

**What we’re trying to achieve:** Our customers want to improve their online visibility with outstanding content. Effective content will generate mentions from notable sites, secure write ups in online publications, improve SEO rank, and generate buzz around the brand.   


You will be working with [Daniel Kupka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielkupka/), the owner and principal consultant of FrontPage Data, to create creative data-led campaigns for innovative, and engaging brands.   


### You are:

**A Creative That Likes to Learn** 

In a typical engagement, you will be given a client's website, maybe some recorded sales calls, etc. You need to be able to take in that information and then be able to come up with a data story that will resonate with blogs and journalists. You should thrive off of searching on the web for publicly available datasets, or are excited to develop a concept for an idea. 

**A Designer, Refiner & Documenter of Processes**  


Most of the campaigns will be created in collaboration. You need to be able to manage workflows and collaborate on cross-functional teams. So having a background within project management and operations will lend itself well here. Shooting Loom videos doesn't scare you. Providing direct, succinct, actionable instructions is second nature. You understand how to provide instructions to the team or third party in order to delegate confidently. You also take recommendations from client teams and prioritise into a roadmap.

**Have Technical Or Journalistic Expertise**   


You should have at least one area of expertise to help realize campaigns. That can be either building data visualizations in D3 (or any other visualization or dashboarding software), having data analysis skills in R (preferred)/Python, or are a storyteller that is able to summarise technical research for a mass audience in a concise style. Either case, you should know what great looks like. Bonus points for knowledge with statistical concepts and research designs (e.g. surveys).   


**Able to Speak & Write Clearly**

Everything we deliver is written. You don't need to be a grammar expert, or a wordsmith, but you need to be able to communicate clearly and directly to customers and team members.

**A Bias Towards Action**

You move quickly. You get stuff done. You are a producer. Paragraphs are written in minutes, not hours.

### This person will not be:

Looking for a big team, or a company that will grow fast.

You want an office. We will never have one.

Looking for a high pressure environment - we are very relaxed. If you thrive off stress, this isn't the right place to work. If you need a deadline to be 72 hours away to get motivated, this isn't the right spot for you.

Don’t worry about meeting every requirement, we’re interested in seeing what you have to offer.  


### Compensation

Competitive salary, depending on candidate’s experience and skill level. We're open to contract/per project payment. Open to all nationalities. You will get started with a paid client project. 

If you are a fit, please apply here [https://frontpagedata.hrpartner.io/jobs/creative-data-journalist--data-designer--data-analyst--remote--pwaxl](https://frontpagedata.hrpartner.io/jobs/creative-data-journalist--data-designer--data-analyst--remote--pwaxl) with a resume, links to work examples (e.g. Github, design portfolio, blog posts, etc.), and a note about why you are interested in the job. Also, let us know what’s the coolest dataset you’ve ever discovered.

I am also working on building out my github with kaggle competitions, but not sure how helpful those would be in getting that interview.

Note: my resume is a little cut off, but the main parts are there.

Thanks

caw7vn,DS but they wan the BI — or do they...,"I’m about to graduate from my Masters in Data Science — so I applied for a BI position that would have me working under a group of ~10 data scientists. In the interview, instead of asking me BI questions (SQL, PowerBI, etc), they tested me for all I’m worth on predictive models, A/B testing, and statistical assumptions — not mad about it because that’s what I’m good at, but it was unexpected to say the least.

c6ekc6,R vs. Python in People Analytics/DS Roles,"There seems to be a serious debate over which stats/coding language to learn: R or Python for the social sciences/people analytics. I'm looking to move into a more data science-heavy role (I love stats and working with data), but still within the social sciences (e.g., use stats to create predictive models of people's behavior, think People Analytics). Further, I've been teaching myself R for the last few months, have put a fair amount of time into it, and really like it. However, I'm worried organizations are looking for Python.

&#x200B;

Do you feel companies are looking for Python more so than R? Will Python be easier to learn once I've become quite fluent in R? Should I drop R immediately and start learning Python?

&#x200B;

c0qqpj,Best way to study for hackerrank tests?,"I’m taking a test this weekend on SQL and Python. 2 questions each, 2 hours total. It’s for a Data Analyst position at a Hedge Fund - I have 1 year experience as a Data Analyst and then 2 years as a Data Manager at the same fintech startup. I had no formal education in SQL but have been querying every day with obnoxiously messy database structure and I recently completed Colt’s Udemy course. I’m comfortable with joins, cases, aggregate functions, and I’m nearly golden with sub queries. Python on the other hand I haven’t started actually learning until this week - I’m a very quick learner (finished Jose’s Python Udemy just now after 2 days, completed milestone projects in under 2 hours each and rarely got chapter test questions wrong). I’m taking his data Python Udemy next to go over pandas and numpy. I’m used to working with messy data through my job - I normally use VBA and macros. 

Other than the Udemy classes, and the handful of hackerrank practice problems, is there anything else I should specifically work on/check out? I don’t have enough time to read a book - I have to take the test before start of business on Monday.

bi7yzo,Seeking Data Science summer internship in Europe (paid/unpaid)- preferably in Western Europe/Scandinavia,"I am a 4th year PhD student studying Biomedical Engineering at the University of Southern California and my research is focused on applied mathematics. Outside academic research, I have completed a Master's in Electrical Engineering with a Data Science emphasis, and have worked on independent projects on Python, R and SQL. My goal for this summer was to get a Data Science internship in the US, but nothing really worked out after making it to 2nd round interviews with Lyft, Uber, Wayfair and a startup.

Since I prefer to not work on my research over the summers and focus on career prep, I was initially planning on spending the summer somewhere in Europe where I could further polish my Data Science skills during the days on my own time and explore a new city during the nights/free time. Another recent post on this subreddit made me realize that it might be possible to get an unpaid/low-paid internship abroad for the Summer. I am guessing having it be unpaid would remove the complications of having to get a work visa for the summer too. If anyone knows of such opportunities in Europe (preferably somewhere where English is well understood by the general population), please let me know. I am including links to my github and Data Science blog below:

bhtg5c,I got an offer. I need some serious advice.,"Hi,

I have been looking to find a data scientist position. I recently got an offer from a company for a data analyst position that does work on DNA data.

The salary is below what I am being paid now (I am an electrical engineer looking to do the career shift) and there are really heavy on sequence data analysis. 

I like the culture and especially the manager. However, I am not sure if this position helps me move toward data scientist positions?

If I start this position, do I have to stay in bio field? They don't do that much of work using big data platforms (Hadoop, Spark, etc), is it still a good opportunity for career growth?

6ydhuw,Work on the second hardest problem in applied machine vision!,"We're building a 100% machine vision solution for autonomous checkout. Walk into a store, grab what you want, then leave. No lines, no scanning, no self-checkout. The system figures out what you have and charges you automatically. This is a really challenging problem, but, let's be honest, it's easier than self-driving cars (also we'll be going to market much faster, capturing the $500B checkout sector).

Checkout what the real time system is capable of right now here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeS8TJwBAFs

We're looking for engineers and researchers to help tackle this problem. We're backed by YC, Charles River, Initialized, SVAngles, and Social Capital. SF based, will help to relocate.

Research Candidates

We're looking for strong deep learning and machine learning researchers to help lead our research programs. We view deep learning as a science, not an art, and we're looking for strong scientists: people that can generate, test, and refine hypotheses rapidly, with minimal bias. Fail fast, fail often. That's the mantra of startups, and that's the mantra of science. Help us rapidly generate targeted hypotheses and approaches for building a system that can completely comprehend the massive amount of video footage we feed it. Every engineer at Standard works on algorithms. Your job as a researcher will be to help guide the overarching research arc, as well as to roll up your sleeves and iterate on models yourself. 

Engineering Candidates

We're looking for strong Python engineers to help develop and productionize soft real-time algorithms in our vision pipeline. We have lots of big problems to solve. Engineers looking to lead and take on hard projects are welcome. Take cutting-edge research that requires massive clusters to work and make it run in real time on a single machine. Take disparate research results and merge them together into more powerful models. Build a massively parallel system that can comprehend 100Gbps of raw footage streaming from hundreds of cameras.

Experience in some of these areas is a plus but not required: high performance and scientific computing, cluster management, deep learning, image processing, performance optimization, algorithmic research. Experience with some of these tools is a plus: cython, numpy, TensorFlow or some other deep learning framework, opencv, nix. If you're smart, passionate, and can learn fast on the job, we're happy to train an engineer in any and all of these areas.

500njw,Looking for advice on career transition,"So I don't have a background in computer science, I've spent the last six years of my career in broadcast journalism. I've had an interest in big data for a while and as my career has progressed I've learned a lot of technical skills on my own and it seems to come kind of naturally to me. 

Recently I've been working on teaching myself Python and SQL just to have a better understanding of the programming languages. I'd like to make a transition into a career in data science. 

My concern is I'm not really in a position to go back to school full time and to be honest I don't want to take on a massive amount of debt through student loans for a masters program. 

I've found a few certificate programs in data science, but I'm worried that a certificate alone isn't going to be enough to get me a job especially because I don't have a prior background in computer science. And considering they still cost a couple thousand dollars, obviously I wouldn't want to do it unless it can lead to employment.

I was hoping I might be able to get some advice on whether a certificate program is enough to actually get hired. Thanks for the help. ",7,2,gonzo_pirate,2016-08-28 18:24:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScienceJobs/comments/500njw/looking_for_advice_on_career_transition/,0,datasciencejobs

oqnvcd,Data Science Consulting Interview Prep,"Dear colleagues,

I am turning to you (especially those who work or have worked in Data Science Consulting) for some interview prep advice. So far my professional experience constitutes of working in marketing where I used data to drive business decisions for 1.5 yrs., then data analytics for 1yr. and machine learning 2 yrs. I believe my experience sets me up well for a job in consulting, which I want to pursue because I think I can be good with clients, and I am still young and would love to take this opportunity to keep exploring my career paths.

So I can guess I will have to do some aptitude test and I will have a technical interview where they will try to gauge my understanding of various models, ask me about bias-variance trade-off and similar questions. For this I am reading The Introduction to Statistical Learning book, taking notes and preparing model answers. Do you have any advice on how I can increase my chance of success in this part of the interview?

What I don't know is how the consulting interview may be different to a standard ML interview where one would do ML for the company internally. I am guessing there may be a case study based interview. Would anyone be able to tell me more about this and how I can prepare for it? Also, would they test my programming knowledge? Is it worth me practicing programming problems online, or are they only used for software engineering positions? What else may be different about the ML consulting interview compared to a standard one?

In short, what should I expect and could you suggest any good resources to help my preparation? I am ready to work my ass off.",7,0,Sandyman93,2021-07-24 11:01:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScienceJobs/comments/oqnvcd/data_science_consulting_interview_prep/,0,datasciencejobs

Thinking of learning more about the data engineering side since alot of recruiters who reach out to me asking if I did etl pipelines, which I have 0 experience in.

I'm graduating with a BS in Economics in a year, and I've become really interested in becoming a Data Scientist. Research has shown that an Economics degree is a good candidate for the career. Do you agree?

That being said, my Bachelor's put no emphasis on programming, and perhaps underemphasized the math department. So I, in conjunction with my advisors, are brainstorming a bare-bones checklist of skills that could get my foot in the door (if not landing a job, at least recommending me for a Master's program.)

Basically, 10-ish must have courses I need?

I am new to Reddit and I have a few questions in regards to looking for a job as a Data Scientist. I am currently pursuing my M.S in Data Science, and I graduate in December. I have been applying myself to a lot of companies in the Northeast region of the United States. Over the fall term I would be doing my practicum in topology and I fully understand Neural Networks and Persistent Homology, and I would like to find a career that would help me incorporate Deep Learning with CNN Topologies. I’ve applied to countless internships in my area to no avail, as I’m constantly being told that I’m overqualified for the positions I’ve been applying too. So I’ve decided to embark on Kaggle competitions as a learning research tool. 

What recommendations would you give to a prospective Data Scientist, who is multi-lingual (English, Spanish, Italian) and is new to the professional scene with knowledge of advanced mathematics and programming languages(Python, R-Studio, SQL)

I’m currently a transportation engineer in NYC trying to hop into a role more involved with data analytics. Although my current job lets me play around with some data analysis (usually in Excel and some very limited VBA), I want something that more heavily focuses on data and client work. 

I think my current background is a good start, but I realize I need more tangible skills, specifically SQL or Python in order to make the career jump. Are there any recommended boot camps based in NYC or online where I can improve my SQL skills ? Preferably one where I can attend part-time as I need to maintain income from my current job.

Just some background information about me... I have recently finished my studies for a masters in AI focusing on machine learning and big data. I have 3 years experience as a java developer but never worked as a data scientist.

Company 1 offers data science as a service. It has a well-established team and clientele from different industries. They offered me a role which focuses on machine learning and big data technologies.

Company 2 is a startup betting company and they are looking to set up a data team. I will be working with another senior data scientist and would be involved throughout the entire setup process.

In my opinion, the first company gives me an opportunity to learn from a number of experienced people whilst exploring different datasets and industries. The second company will provide me with more hands-on experience, room for research and ability to learn from my mistakes.

In your opinion, which company offers the best learning experience? In the future, which experience will make me more employable?",6,6,ganninu93,2017-11-07 12:22:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScienceJobs/comments/7bctl3/advise_on_career_opportunity/,0,datasciencejobs

My current research is looking for Data Scientists to take part in a study if anyone is interested. I am carrying out a study on the use of data science methodologies during Covid lockdown specifically looking into the Business Understanding phase of projects. It would require a 15 - 20 min interview discussing the way you engaged with projects in lockdown.

My resume per say consists of the follow:

* Bachelor's Degree in Management Information Systems
* A year as an office assistant at a large firm in NYC
* My current role as Help Desk Analyst in the medical field.

&#x200B;

Things related to Data Science that I hope I can translate into further education on the topic are:

* Took a semester developing dashboards in Tableau in college.
* Took Statistics in college as well as Advanced Placement Statistics my senior year of high school.
* Coding experience in college and high school(Most c#, c++, and basic SQL)

&#x200B;

So I guess my question is, where can I go from here to begin transitioning? What education resources should I seek out that would help my resume? How difficult will it be to get an entry-ish level data science position?

TUMI is a cross-Grounds, Precision Medicine-focused initiative that aims to leverage world-class academic and translational research resources at the University of Virginia to distinguish the University as a global leader in the study of host-microbiome interactions in health and disease. The major goals of TUMI, in collaboration with researchers across UVA, are to: 1) Isolate, culture, and characterize diverse microbiota; 2) Transfer microbiota from humans or conventional donor mice to gnotobiotic mice (raised in germ-free facilities) to establish   causal   relationships   between microbes and host phenotypes; 3) Identify microbes and microbial products with therapeutic potential; 4) Promote host-microbiome scientific projects using TUMI resources to support preliminary data for competitive external funding; 5) Engage industry partners to accelerate the application of  microbiome  science  to  the  bedside. The Microbiome Data Scientist being recruited through this posting will be invaluable in the processing of ‘omics data into easy-to-understand, publishable information.

The Microbiome Data Scientist I will work with one other Microbiome Data Scientist I (based in the Department of Medicine) and the TUMI Data Science Committee (Professor Jason Papin and two faculty-level Co-directors of Data Science based in Pediatrics and Medicine) to process, analyze, visualize, and publish data generated through TUMI pilot and feasibility grants. Two Microbiome Data Scientists are being recruited. Through both recruits, we hope to satisfy as many of the skills and interests listed below as possible, which overlap substantially with the planned responsibilities for the recruit. Candidates should apply if they have experience in all or several of the areas below:

General skills and experience:

* Experience balancing work on multiple projects.
* Experience working on collaborative projects.
* Experience communicating ideas or results from within your own domain of expertise to non-experts in that domain.
* Must have a master's degree and 2 years of experience or 4 years of experience and a bachelor's degree in a life or quantitative science (Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science, Bioengineering, Biomedical Engineering, Data Science).

Biological experience

* Experience working on biology-related projects through research or coursework (advanced undergraduate or graduate).
* Experience working with amplicon sequencing data (e.g., 16S rRNA gene sequencing data).
* Experience working with RNA-sequencing data.
* Experience processing and/or analyzing metabolomics data (mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance).
* Familiarity with and interest in scientific literature related to the gut microbiome, microbial communities across nature, microbiology, human nutrition, and/or pathogens.

Computational & software experience

* Experience working on computational projects ranging from data analysis to formal software development using any programming language.
* Experience with Python and/or R (especially data analysis and visualization).
* Experience with a git-based version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
* Experience with command line tools on unix-based systems (MacOS, Ubuntu, etc.).
* Experience with high-performance computing, especially using a SLURM job management system.
* Experience working with package management systems and platforms (e.g. Conda, Virtualenv, pip).

The Microbiome Data Scientist I will work with microbiome researchers across UVA to process and analyze ‘omics data for microbiome studies. For each project, the Microbiome Data Scientist I will be paired with one of the two Co-directors of Data Science for TUMI; opportunities for increasing independence are available. This position will provide substantial opportunities to engage with researchers across grounds, co-author publications, and receive training in multiple facets of microbiome data science through on-the-job training with TUMI personnel and access to UVA coursework ([https://hr.virginia.edu/career-development/education-benefits](https://hr.virginia.edu/career-development/education-benefits)). This position is funded for 3 years through TUMI, with future opportunities available if TUMI investigators successfully obtain additional grants.

To apply please visit UVA job board [https://uva.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/UVAJobs](http://uva.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/UVAJobs), and search for ""R0014747""

Please submit a cover letter and CV/resume. The cover letter should justify your fit for the position, including a description of specific previous experience(s) working on a biological and/or software project(s). Links to content demonstrating your role in these experiences are encouraged (e.g., code, scientific publications, thesis documents or reports, etc.). In the cover letter, please also include contact information for at least three references who may be contacted if your application is selected for further review.

Address questions related to the application to Dr. Casandra Hoffman, Program Director for TUMI (clh4he@virginia.edu)

The selected candidate will be required to complete a background check at time of offer per University Policy.

caazna,What’s better?,"I was hoping to get some perspective on a range of choices I have in front of me. 

Current situation:
- BS - Information Systems
- MS - Information Systems (business intelligence emphasis)
- both degrees had minimal exposure to mathematical concepts

I am nearing the completion of my MS degree and have began to wonder how long a quote on quote “hype” data science degree will be in the long run for my career.

I am curious about pursuing an MS in Finance. The reasoning here is I believe data science and finance will merge even more than they currently are in the coming years. So being able to hedge my data science skills with finance seems beneficial. This degree is also not particularly math intensive. 

Other option would be to pursue an MS in Econometrics or pursue some sort of math intensive degree.

At the end of all this, I am concerned about my math competence potentially causing me issues down the road. Should I pursue a math based degree over a finance degree?

How much math really matters in a real world data science position anyway? 

I can elaborate more if needed. Thank you!",5,7,NeffAddict,2019-07-07 19:42:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScienceJobs/comments/caazna/whats_better/,0,datasciencejobs

Hiring manager sent an email immediately telling me that he is currently collecting input from all people and will get back to me about next steps within a week however it may take a bit longer due to people being on vacation or business trip. However so far looks like i did very well. 

Later, i sent a message to people (3 people in team) thanking for their time and that i enjoyed my day.

One of them replied back and said they were happy to meet me and currently they are going through some internal processes for hiring, i should be hear from them soon.

Not sure if this is positive or negative, i was wondering how long it generally takes for offer or this internal thing is somewhat of a disagreement between people whether to hire me. I would like to send my followup email asking them accordingly. I dont want to clog their email constantly asking what happened. So if there is any suggestion, i’d be happy.

bpjg7p,I made a mistake in my screening step about the salary. Now how can I negotiate?,"Hi,

In the screening step, I made a mistake by giving a range of salary say between MIN and MAX value.

Now, I receive an offer which is closer to MAX value. I heard it is always good to negotiate and also I noticed that the workload of the startup is a bit high and they are close to a few deadlines. So I think I need to ask more, and I asked that from the HR when she gave me the offer over the phone. She said we are generously giving you an offer close to your upper bound! That is when I told them the position is a bit more senior level than I first expected.

Hi. I'm working as deep learning engineer.  
I'm interested in starting a startup company which deals with big data driven medicine project.  
Strong computing power and big data are new paradigm resources that we can use in this era.  
So, I think methodology using them probably can be paradigm shift and game changer.  
For example, there are research papers that say eating 3 eggs in a week is good for the health, and there are research papers that say eating 3 eggs in a week is harm for the health. There can be various reasons that this paradoxical situation happens.  
As all other people think, I also just think using strong computing power and big data can help that paradoxical situation.

I'm interested in genomics, cancer, better treatment/diagnosis, new drug discovery, etc.  
And I'm also interested in better A.I. like AGI (artificial general intelligence) which is enhanced in its systemic architecture by mimicking neuroscience mechanism as a long-term goal which is valuable goal itself worth to pursue as well as the supporting technique that can help short-term medicine challenge goals.  
\- What I'm looking for:  
For the first, I'm looking for data scientist, machine learning engineer who can start open data science competitions like from Kaggle.  
And if we can make good working, I would like to launch a startup together.  
\- PS:  
As working is going, I'll tell you my thoughts on what I would like to do, what I have as problem recognition on current medicine field.

9tlvpo,Professional website to attract clients as a data scientist,"I have recently started working as a contractor/freelance consultant in data science. I made a quick and dirty website in Django to attract clients, but I feel what I can do does not look very professional. I know there's Wordpress etc but I would like to stand out a little more with a proper professionally designed site rather than what I can do with my limited amateur skills.

Ideally I would like a nice looking site where I can post blog articles about interesting DS problems, and advertise my skill set. If it's in Django it means later on it would be quite easy to add some cool Python demos of machine learning models such as text classifiers etc.

Does anyone have experience with a professional site advertising their services, and who would you recommend to build it, and what kind of layout and content did you find effective?

9dao0j,Master's thesis internships in the US?,"I go to school in Sweden, and I am both an American and EU citizen. I mention this to preclude any answers about visas: there are zero concerns about this from either side as I require none.

It's very common in Europe that a master's student will work as an intern or co-op student while writing a thesis about the work they're doing, and that thesis project will last anywhere from 3-6 months. The actual writing of the thesis comprises anywhere between 10% and 25% of the time spent at work, depending on negotiations. The company obviously benefits, having a tailored research project completed by someone who has immediate access to academic material while not wasting any of their salaried employees' time.

I applied to somewhere around 300 positions in the US (and around 50 outside) this summer specifying that this is the sort of situation I was looking for. I got replies from maybe 10 of them, each waffling and giving different reasons for why this wasn't an ideal setup. Each interview went swell, I killed the take-home assessments, etc.

Their most common concern was protecting intellectual property (IP). My school allows us to request that the thesis is embargoed, i.e., not published for a few years, which I thought would satisfy their needs. Apparently not.

So what the hell? Why is this not a common setup? It's cheap labor with first-rate access to academic knowledge and exploring vectors of research that the employees have considered but haven't gotten around to. If I were an employer I'd make an effort to connect with schools to have them explore under-researched areas of my company's subject area, especially if I'm mid- to large-sized.

I have looked through the university's career advisors but they don't have many contacts in the US.

1)  All of my programming knowledge is self taught within the past few years so it is difficult for me to gauge my proficiency. How can I get a feel for how my skills compare so I can represent my competencies accurately to potential employers?

2) My main language is Python. Other tools I've played with include Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Theano, Keras, C++, D3.js, SQL, css and flask. Most of these have been for one off projects (I learned enough to accomplish what I needed to for a particular project but I don't use them on a regular basis). Are there any glaring holes in my knowledge base? What should I focus on learning in the year or so until I graduate?

8es22c,Bridging the gap between graduating and Data Science/ML jobs.,"I am an undergraduate student (B.Sc - Artificial Intelligence) currently doing my final-year Thesis. Throughout the 3 year university course I have heavily used Python, become accustomed to it so much so that I fell in love with it. As you could assume I am also writing my Thesis using the language.

Given that I'm set to graduate in the coming months, I've set out to find jobs in Machine Learning or Big Data, happily settling for just Python careers if the opportunity arises. The thing is that although I DO have software dev experience, I have worked on system programming using C/C++ and ERP/BI solutions (Dynamics NAV) [still do]. These are completely unrelated to the jobs I'm aiming for and the experience acquired through university means fuck all for employers.

I don't know how to approach this gap...employers offering such a role are looking for a shit-ton of experience and yet, at least in my country (European), people properly qualified for such a role are rare to say the least. I could move to lower-requirement jobs such as Java or .Net dev, but that's still not really helping me gain the necessary experience I need.

(As a side note - I am planning on enrolling in a Masters degree following my current course as I think it's crucial for someone at an entry level such as myself to nail such a high-requirement job)

87i1ae,Some advice for an ECE PhD,"I finished my PhD in ECE and I'm thinking of getting into the data science job market.

My question is, what do I absolutely have to do to land / pass a data science interview at this point? Do I need to do a couple Kaggle projects? What about AI jobs vs data science jobs?

I'm experienced in building machine learning models that can predict the values of some fields from other fields, allowing you to make your signup form shorter.  For example I built and deployed a model for a large job hunting website, which predicts statistics about candidates based on their CV. This has resulted in a large ROI. 

I can work with all kinds of data including text and images. It takes a few months turnaround and I will get hands on to get it deployed. You can measure the results by A/B tests.

7rhy2w,"Self taught software dev, have opportunity to take data-science course, will it help with job opportunities?","So I've been programming as a hobby for like 10 years, mostly off-and-on, but I've gotten pretty good. Lately I've been working on making a decently-sized Node/React project to add to my portfolio so I could start applying for frontend or backend javascript positions. I also have a couple really small Android app freelance jobs, a couple HTML5 games(one that is pretty complicated and big, but still just a demo), and a few other small projects in my portfolio. 

I was planning on applying for jobs in about a month, since that'd give me enough time to finish my web app and set up a portfolio site. But I have the opportunity to start a 3-month data-science bootcamp type course that begins next week. I have been super poor my whole life so the fact that I have this opportunity is really amazing for me. Data-science isn't really my thing, I've checked out the course(bigbang-datascience.com end-to-end data science course) and there is a decent amount of machine learning and python though, both of which are things I am very interested in learning and don't have a lot of experience in.

Right now my primary focus needs to be finding a job though, I think I'm kinda beyond where I need to be to start applying for entry level software/web development positions, but it's really hard to say with any confidence that I WILL be able to get a job(I also have a few misdemeanors on my record from a few years ago, and no legitimate references I can give to employers). As someone with no college degree, I think this course might give me skills and education that would make potential employers take me a lot more seriously, which is why I'm starting to think I should take advantage of this opportunity.

One thing I'm specifically very curious to hear peoples opinions about is whether my programming and web development skills will overlap with the data-science skills in a way that will improve my chances of getting a job in either field. If I take the course and decide to apply for web or software development jobs anyway(as that is the career I'm more interested in) will the skills I learn in the data-science course give me a better shot at getting a job? Or if I can't get a regular development job, will my existing experience and skills in software and web development help me out when applying for data-science positions?

I could really use any advice here, I don't have a good understanding of the professional world and I need to make a decision soon. This is a one-time opportunity, but someone else is going to be putting up the money for me to take this course, and I really don't want to do that if it's not going to work out and really give me an advantage with starting a career.

54nt18,I'm looking for advice.,"Hi I all, I'm looking for some advice transitioning to data science. I have a BA in physics, a MS in geophysics and left a 2 year stint as a PhD student in Earth and Planetary Sciences. My topic was computational geophysics, programmed in Matlab and C++. Because of this background, and my desire to get out of the earth sciences, I think data science is a good spot for me. Right now I'm taking a course at an extension school (Intro to data science) and am taking a machine learning class online. I have some experience with python, though I haven't done any real serious developing 5with it in 5 years (I haven't had any breaks in school).  My goal right now is to work on a few interesting data science projects in my spare time, post them on git hub, and then apply for jobs in a few months when I have completed these courses. Do you think this is realistic? I was thinking that jr data scientist, even though i have a graduate experience , is what I should be aiming for.  Any advice or confirmation of my plan would be appreciated.. especially on what types of companies I should apply to. I am obviously attracted to the big tech companies, but those jobs seem competitive, and am really down to just get my feet wet. 

Thanks for reading this post. ",5,3,WeoDude,2016-09-27 00:09:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScienceJobs/comments/54nt18/im_looking_for_advice/,0,datasciencejobs

**[Data Scientist](https://www.affirm.com/careers/data-scientist/)**

Affirm is a technology and data-driven finance company. We are mining vast amounts of data to successfully rewrite the rules on how credit is evaluated. Our Data Scientists play an absolutely pivotal role in the company, writing the models that allow us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our users in unprecedentedly holistic, efficient, and accurate ways.

*What You'll Do*

* Build production fraud and credit machine learning models; your models will decide who we lend to in real time
* Conduct ad-hoc data analyses; your analyses will decide which policies we adopt, where we expand our business, and whom our partners will be


*What We Look For*

* Passion and drive to change consumer banking for the better
* Deep understanding of and experience with machine learning and data analysis
* Strong programming ability, preferably in python

**About Affirm**

At Affirm we are using technology to re-imagine and re-build core parts of financial infrastructure to enable cheaper, friendlier, and more transparent financial products and services that improve lives. 

We believe the financial industry is fundamentally broken. Not only is the core infrastructure built with technology from the 1970s, but there are a dwindling number of people who say “I trust my bank to look out for me.” It doesn’t have to be this way, and it’s our mission to fix this problem.

We are based in San Francisco; founded by Max Levchin (founding CTO PayPal), Jeff Kaditz (CDO DeNA/ngmoco), and Nathan Gettings (founding CTO of Palantir); and building a team of exceptionally talented people to join us on our mission.

3hgvld,"[Hiring] Data Science Team, Chicago IL","Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today is different. The average insurance policy for a mom+pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story. And if you’re a tiny limited partnership or freelancer, you’ve either been reduced to a crudely estimated risk metric or excluded from the market.

This is just a taste of the type of big problem we want you to solve. We seeking data scientists for new roles in Chicago with the mission to transform traditional insurance models into cutting edge solutions for small businesses.

As one of the founding members of a small, multi-disciplinary team of technologists, designers, and industry experts, you’ll have the freedom to make key decisions without much oversight and the tools and resources to build and ship ideas quickly. You’ll be a part of a startup-like environment in a company with millions of existing users.

Our team will exude leanness, practicing iterative design techniques to concept, prototype, test, and build products. We will commit to a fast-paced release cycle from idea to product, measured in weeks instead of months.

nmn4cj,[Hiring] Machine learning job: Machine Learning Engineer at Ntropy Network (work from anywhere!) | Salary: $130k - $180k • 0.1% - 1.2%,"Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratising some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our first product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible with minimal engineering overhead to both humans and machine-learning models in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We are currently looking for founding machine learning and back-end engineers to join our team.

We
are allergic to over-engineering.
are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results. 
are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.
have a sense of humour (well, we think we do).

As a founding member of our team, you will help
push the limits of cutting-edge computing and machine learning
build the team and drive the direction of the company.
shape our product and culture.
assemble our engineering stack.
experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.

What will be my role?
We are mostly looking for ML and backend engineers at the moment. However, if you are excited by the vision and believe you will be a good fit, we would love to talk!

Who else is on the team?
We are 6 people at the moment, 2 (ops / biz) + 4 engineers: Nare, Ilia, David, Chady, Misak, Jonathan.

Where is Ntropy located?
We are fully remote, with a virtual base in San Francisco, CA.

What time-zones do you work with?
We hire anywhere in the time zones GMT-8 to GMT+1.

Do you consider part-time work?
Not at the moment. Full-time roles only.

How are you funded?
We are backed by some of the top fintech investors in the world. Have raised single-digit millions of dollars so far. Can share more details over the call.

Do you already have a product?
Currently in beta with 20+ customers.

Do you plan to sell customer data?
Ntropy is on a mission to enable products without data barriers. We will never sell customer data and will always put privacy and customer benefit ahead of any auxiliary financial gains.

What is the interview process like?
If we mutually feel we can build great stuff together, at least on paper, we will do a video call to kick things off and screenshare your favourite side project (45 mins).
We will then give you a take-home project related to whatever we are currently working on (6 hours project + 1 hour discussion).
If all goes well, we will set up a group call with the rest of the team to nerd out and generally spend time together (2 hours).

Above all, we respect your time and commitment and will keep you up to speed on where we are during the entire process.

What are your hiring plans?
We aim to be 10-12 people in the next 6 months. Mostly technical positions. We are hiring as slowly as possible to build our mojo.

What is your current stack?
back-end - Python + Rust (where performance matters)
compute - AWS + GCP
ML - Python (Pytorch)

Work / life balance?
At the current stage of the company, our probability of success is directly correlated to effort. The number of hours you put in can make a big difference. However, if we cannot rely on your presence at all times, we must surely be able to rely on your outcomes, no matter how much time it takes. Mental and physical wellbeing are above anything else.

mfux2s,Statistics based jobs,"Hey guys, am a Product Manager and so far so good. To be honest, even though I am good at what I do, there are almost no HARD SKILLS involved. This pandemic got me thinking about what if I am laid off at work and can't find another PM job?! And as such I want to keep backup options. Now data science is one of the options on my mind but it seems a lot of work at this point.

I had taken a couple of Statistics courses during my undergrad covering topics like Correlation, Frequency distributions, Central tendencies, Dispersion, Skewness, Kurtosis, Contingency, Regression, Time Series, Probability distributions, Sampling, Estimation etc. Add to that I know SQL, Excel and Python

Is there any family of jobs with the Data space which mainly utilises statistical methods and don't go all the way into ML algorithms etc. and which I can get by refreshing my present quantitative skill sets?

I'm a Senior Business Analytics student with a bit of a dilemma on my hands. I am on track to graduate this May. I have a decent GPA of about 3.5, as well as courses in R and Python. I have taken a basic course over Databases and SQL. My resume is up to date and has been looked over by a professional resume writer.

In spite of my education, I am struggling to even get an interview. I have been regularly applying for jobs in the field, with no success so far.

lo2yum,Hi! I would like your advice about Colleges and programs,"Hi everyone! 
Since few months ago, i've been studying Python, SQL, and some skills in Data Analysis and Data Science.  Also, i've been creating some projects in data analysis and scraping. 

However, I want to get an academic program (some validation program/certificate) from a college in Data Analysis, Data science, Data Analytics, Software development or something related to those fields. 

I've been doing some research, and i've found that the colleges offers minor and major degrees, associates degrees and certificates.. and want your opinion and advice for the followings: 

1. What program do you recommend to me? A minor, major, associate or a certificate? I have low incomes, so, for semester i just can pay $2000 or less. 

2. What colleges do you recommend to me in Utah, preferably in Salt Lake City?  

Pd. The following are some the colleges (and programs) that could be interesting: 

1. Ensign College. 
Programs: Software Engineering (Certificate). / Business Analytics (Certificate). 

2. Utah Valley University. 
Program: Data Analytics. (Certificate of Proficiency). 

3. Westminster College. 
Program: Data Science. (Minor Degree). 

4. Salt Lake Community College. 
Program: Computer Sciences and Information Systems (Associate of Applied Science). 

If you have another option, please share with me! 
I really would love your advices and opinions about this topic!

lgvz7c,What job profile and what kind of company should I apply to in Canada?,"Hi,
After doing a BE in electronics and telecom, I have worked as an embedded software engineer in a robotics startup in India for 2.5 years, where along with embedded, I had also worked on a number of basic software tasks like developing java utilities, basic chat bots, opencv using python for raspberry pi (for poc), as well as making use of uart, i2c, spin protocols, bootloader functions, writing test firmware and testing, a dc, etc. All of these tasks were basic level and as I was learning, I would take help from my colleagues. 
After this I came to Canada for a masters with thesis with machine learning in biomedical application as my primary thesis topic. I learned some important aspects of machine learning like svm, lda, qda, knn, time series, and very basics of deep learning. I also learned statistics using r and some fundamentals of ai. I feel I learned some very basic things in data science and machine learning in my masters and now I'm about to defend my thesis. I also worked part time in a company that teaches coding to children using blocks, side by side to my masters , writing code in javascript for block modules for a controller, and some work in pcb designing libraries as well. I have also done a teaching assistantship for a software design course which teaches introduction of oop to electrical engineers and learned the subject quite well myself. 
So now I know- python, Matlab in high proficiency, c, c++, java, javascript in medium proficiency, r in basic proficiency, statistics and machine learning and embedded software on a basic level. 
I am confused now since I know so many different things but in very basic level. 
So what job profile in Canada can I apply for once I graduate or what company requires someone with such skills? As I know basics of different things but I'm not an expert in any.",4,0,Fragrant-Room6682,2021-02-10 15:26:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScienceJobs/comments/lgvz7c/what_job_profile_and_what_kind_of_company_should/,0,datasciencejobs

Now the thing is, every once in a while I take a look at some data science positions and I realized that most of them requier at least Master's Degree. So I decided maybe I should apply for one myself while working, and I always felt my statistical knowledge is somewhat limited. I've found this industrial engineering program and its [curriculum](http://akts.hacettepe.edu.tr/ders_listesi.php?birim_ref=AKDBRM_0000000000000000000000564&birim_kod=2016&prg_oid=PRGRAM_0000000000000000000000533&prg_kod=20161&programduzey=3&submenuheader=2&dil_kod=2) looked interesting, so I've applied. Now that I got accepted, I started to have second thoughts. A lot of questions started to wonder in my mind so I would like to share them with you in hope of little bit of help:

1) Is master's degree really a must thing to have? Is it possible to do/showcase empirical research about the subjects (basically an alternative for masters thesis)? 

2) Is this level of statistics and stochastic modeling in the curriculum have common usage in real life business problems? 

3) Same old question... Portfolio with Kaggle competitions (or equivalent) or academic background helps more when it comes to finding a job?

Thank you very much in advance.",5,4,miralia,2019-06-26 08:52:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScienceJobs/comments/c5nfsx/should_i_study_industrial_engineering_on_graduate/,0,datasciencejobs

btlgye,A day in the life of a Data Scientist,"Hey Guys, 

As a data science student with no experience at all, I was wondering what a day at the office of a data scientist looks like. No matter what your specialisation or current workfield is, as long as you are working with data I'm interested in what your day to day job looks like. Feel free to sketch the context! 

+ If someone has some lecture about real life data science/machine learning business cases with comprehensive details about all steps of the projects, feel free to share!
