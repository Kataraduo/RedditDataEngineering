*Do you have an interest in understanding every step of a deep learning model? If you have taken a linear algebra course, and can run a Python debugger, then you‚Äôre needed to build AI models for a deep learning platform that is specialized for interactive model development.*

\[EDIT\]: Applicants must already have US work authorization.

## Company Description

[Cerbrec](https://cerbrec.com/) develops a deep learning framework that brings visibility and intelligent guidance to researchers and AI teams. The framework runs on Cerbrec‚Äôs platform, *Graphbook*, that provides an interactive compute environment for orchestrating the data flow inside deep learning models.  Cerbrec is capturing the market demand for niche models across a variety of industries, from ontology research to manufacturing.

## Role Description

* In summary, *interns are building out a library of model components from primitive-level operations* like element-wise addition and matrix multiplication. For example, you'll build out loss functions, activation functions, special model layers, task specific heads, and more.
   * The main task is to take Python implementations of other model components (such as from PyTorch, Tensorflow, and HuggingFace) and build them in Graphbook by building from scratch or editing existing blueprints. These models will be distributed for general public re-use or based on requests from customers.
   * Currently we have some pre-trained and fine-tuned model blueprints like BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, Flan-T5, Llama, and others. We are expanding to include other models, and advanced interns would work on constructing and testing models to match the original implementations.
* By the end of the internship, interns at all levels of expertise will greatly improve their understanding of AI model architectures such as transformers and gain familiarity with novel techniques coming from AI research.
* Interns will work directly with the co-founders ([https://www.linkedin.com/company/cerbrec](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cerbrec))

## Key Responsibilities You‚Äôll Do

* Interns are responsible for becoming proficient with the Graphbook platform. They‚Äôll be provided with free access to a Graphbook platform Pro account and compute credits to train and deploy models when necessary. They will report bugs but will not be expected to do any software development to fix them.
* The main task by interns will be to develop new blueprints of AI models and machine learning workflows. We generally look to have them match roughly to 3 decimal places of the original implementation.
* An optional sub-task is to be involved in generating media content around the development of these new models.
* This remote internship will be at least 8 weeks, with potential to move to full-time when applicable. Interns will be compensated at 15-40 $/hr based on experience.

## Minimum Qualifications

* Linear algebra knowledge / coursework
* Experience running a Python debugger such as with PyCharm or VSCode
* Ability to commit to at least 8 weeks, 15 hours per week minimum.

## Preferred knowledge, skills, and abilities

* Experience with a Python tensor library such as Numpy, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Jax, etc.
* Experience with HuggingFace models and using deep learning transformers.

1bukcmg,How do I climb the ML job ladder from here?,"I really want to get deeper into the AI field but I am despairing about it right now. My background is good - Master's degree in a technical field (systems science), studied AI/ML (good math background and took AI/ML classes at graduate level), authorship on a few academic papers, almost twenty years of experience in tech (application and database dev, data science, data engineering). I have a lot (15 years) of python and SQL experience, know a pretty good bit about cloud engineering and architecture (worked mostly in GCP). I have some experience with TensorFlow, Airflow, Spark, Kubeflow, and some other ML-related tools. I worked for a couple of years as a data engineer most recently.

But I have a couple of issues that might be hard for potential employers to get past. I've been in and out of tech a couple of times so my work history isn't linear. I also lost my last job after getting in a car accident (drunk driver hit me and I had several injuries including a third TBI). So now there's a year+ gap on my resume, in addition to the admittedly somewhat unconventional work history. I'm 41 so I feel like ageism is already becoming an issue since I'm not well-established in this field.

Bottom line is that I know I would be a great team member somewhere. I have a good attitude, people like working with me, I have good communication skills and empathy, I am good at seeing the big picture with complicated problems and I learn very quickly.

Am I just out of luck and need to think about doing something other than tech? I've put a lot of work into learning all these skills, so it seems premature to throw in the towel. AI is hot right now but that means tons of other people are trying to get into the field too. I feel like once I get into interviews I do well, but it's hard to get past the noise of the initial job application stage. Any thoughts or advice here? I know I can make a great contribution in the AI area, but I'm just overwhelmed right now.

jvkswn,Are ML certification programs taken seriously?,"I am a PhD biomedical engineer with a BS in applied physics who has been programming pretty much daily in MATLAB, Python, and C/C++ for \~15 years.  It is about 50% of what I do on any given day and I enjoy it more than most things I get tasked with in my current role (consultant at a large, multinational firm).  It seems like ML affords a lot of cool and interesting opportunities, but unfortunately it was not a very mature field when I came along and I have not had the bandwidth to learn it in the meantime.  I did some work with Hidden Markov Models and Expectation Maximization back in the day, but that is about the closest I have gotten to anything I would consider even machine-learning adjacent (that is not entirely true, I am a co-author on a paper that uses SVMs, but I did not do any coding there).  

I am considering a career change and have looked into a few certification programs that seem legit (e.g. MIT, Stanford, Google ones that require a degree in engineering, physics, stats, or CS), but am considering how seriously people take those sorts of programs?  Would I be competitive with my background + one of those certifications?   Would it just be a waste of time and money?

164szsd,Advice on what to learn to become a machine learning engineer,"Hi, hopefully this is the right place to post this.

Basically I'm a software engineer with 8+ years experience aiming at becoming a machine learning engineer ASAP. I have a good understanding of higher maths and statistics, I know python very well and I have experience with pandas, numpy, pytorch, keras, sklearn. In addition to this I've been self studying machine learning for a while, so I know the logic behind a lot of the basic algorithms and have worked with them on real data.

I'm looking to understand where my time is best spent trying to prove myself. My plan currently is to learn in my own time and create projects/enter kaggle competitions so I'll have some public evidence of my learning, I'm also considering starting to blog about it as well. I'm wondering where my time is best spent and what skills should I learn. More specifically:

* are kaggle competitions/similar worth it in my case, or are projects going to be worth more?
* is having a blog/being active on social media necessary?
* should I be writing stuff from scratch or should I be showing I can implement libraries, i.e. using pytorch and fastai or should I be writing in tensorflow and building NNs from scratch etc?
* what sorts of projects are good for ML engineers vs a data scientist? My assumption is that I should look at making new twists on existing algorithms rather than looking at standard data analysis etc but I'm not sure? i.e. should I be analysing data and making things or focusing on implementing algorithms?
* what sorts of projects are good for ML engineers vs a data scientist? My assumption is that I should look at making new twists on existing algorithms rather than looking at standard data analysis etc but I'm not sure?

z41mx4,Folks looking for jobs or hiring.... can we improve hiring process?,"Hello,

I am a data scientist, and occasionally interview candidates as well as sometimes consider the daunting effort of entering the job market myself. It's hard to enter and pass an interview loop, so for folks looking, more strength to you. 

Coming to the purpose of this post - As a side-project to connect data scientists with hiring teams in the market, I am considering running a FREE service to match candidates to openings based on their eligibility and interests. 

Disclaimer- Nobody pays a cent and no personal information is shared¬†(apart from optional LinkedIn profiles) and nothing is sold to any job board. This is not part of any company, completely independent and experimental. The selfish reason for me for doing this is to get and learn from the experience. If interested and¬†you are¬†either looking for jobs or hiring, please read on. If anybody wants to join me, feel free to reach out.

From personal experience, I and our org has had a tough time sifting through candidates for the job postings in the past, due to poor signal-noise ratio.¬†its not a nice experience for candidates either having to mass-apply and hear back automated rejections, if any. 

What I am trying to investigate with this initiative¬†is preemptive matching¬†of candidates¬†to openings based on several criteria so that by the first interview, there is enough¬†information exchange in both directions to minimize false positives. Information exchanged will include common criteria¬†like location, role, benefits etc but also soft criteria¬†like candidate interests, team culture, role within¬†company etc..¬†Matched jobs will directly be sent to your inbox, rest assured the recruiter has added you to their applicant tracking system.

I know this would benefit me as a candidate¬†as well from knowing the team I will be joining; this has long been a pain point for me (here is post I had created  7 months ago-¬†https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ub34kr/what\_information\_about\_the\_hiring\_team\_would\_you/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3)

So, how is this different from the current application process?

\- most job postings are generic to the company, not enough information about the team and manager is shared. understandably for privacy reasons. I am also keeping this private.

\- interview candidates are selected based on past credentials from their resumes. Data science has a fluid definition and requires skills that may not accurately translate through resumes. I collect additional¬†information as you will see in the questionnaires.¬†

\- there is only 1 round of filtering before the 1st interview. high chance of false positives and false negatives. I have multiple rounds of matching before the 1st interview is scheduled.

\- applications are initiated only after matching is completed. no ""Easy Apply"" for mass-applying.

If this piques your interest, please fill out these surveys. I promise no emails will be sent except for qualified candidates¬†or qualified jobs.

Hiring teams-¬†[https://2bz8r4gjuc6.typeform.com/to/oJxkfbv2](https://2bz8r4gjuc6.typeform.com/to/oJxkfbv2)

Candidates-¬†[https://2bz8r4gjuc6.typeform.com/to/XJQxlJSO](https://2bz8r4gjuc6.typeform.com/to/XJQxlJSO)

Please share any feedback as well, I would appreciate any suggestions.

I expect this to be a lot of manual work if the initial¬†interest I received is sustained, but I also believe this to be the right approach to recruiting vs the blind applications I see today. so taking my shot at this.¬†",4,1,sang89,2022-11-25 02:36:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearningJobs/comments/z41mx4/folks_looking_for_jobs_or_hiring_can_we_improve/,0,machinelearningjobs

1bd2is5,How AI might be affecting the demand of ML + software engineers,"I recently did a study on how AI might be affecting the demand of software engineers.   
I took a dataset of 20M job postings from big and small startups. I then used a ML classifier to classify each engineering job to the type of engineer it belonged to (ie backend, ML, date, mobile etc). In addition, I extracted the skills listed in each job using entity extraction. I indexed all of this to an elasticsearch cluster when I ran aggregation queries to see how the # of jobs changed for each type of engineer in the past year.  
Here were my findings:  
1) The # of jobs for ML engineers and research scientists increased 70% from a year ago  
2) # of jobs for frontend, mobile and data engineers all dropped 25% from a year ago, while backend engineers did a bit better dropping at 12%  
3) Data scientist jobs and security engineer jobs did a bit better, both declining 5% or so  
4) There seemed to be no correlation between tech layoffs and the demand for more AI engineers/talent.  
I published my findings in more detail in this article: https://bloomberry.com/how-ai-is-disrupting-the-tech-job-market-data-from-20m-job-postings/. Of course correlation != causation but just trying to make sense of the data as best as I could. Everything I wrote is still just an opinion, but backed by some data :)

I have an interview for a research engineer internship at deepMind in approximately 10 days. The problem is that :

* I am a total newbie in job interviews
* English is not my native language

I have a pretty solid background in ML (I'm a master Student) but these are the kind of interviews where they can just ask you some uncommon questions in statistics (what is a p-value) and you're pretty much fucked.

qt8dun,[Hiring] Machine learning job: Senior Data Scientist at Pave (work from anywhere!) | Salary: $100k - $180k + early founding team equity + healthcare,"Salary: $100k - $180k  + early founding team equity + healthcare
### What we do

[Pave.dev](http://pave.dev) is building a Cashflow API that allows fintech developers and data scientists to connect their data sources and retrieve clean & unified insights into their consumers‚Äô spending habits, bills, earnings profile, and account health.

We're abstracting the data cleaning and transformation efforts necessary to get a single view of a consumer‚Äôs finances so that fintech companies can rapidly build budgeting features, recommendations engines, risk models, and more.

We believe that by lowering the friction of extracting financial insights from the growing number of data sources, we can help accelerate the development of innovative and inclusive financial products. We‚Äôre on a mission to enable builders to reinvent and lower the cost of financial services.

### Background

There are a growing number of companies helping people gain access to digital financial services, whether it‚Äôs low-interest loans, payment installment solutions, integrated insurance offerings, fee-less banking, personalized budgeting, wage advances, or investment solutions.

We believe financial services will exist for every consumer segment, especially underserved segments including female professionals, refugee communities, creators, immigrants, gen-z, retirees, gig workers, and so forth.

Building equitable financial services for underserved consumer segments requires expensive resources, infrastructure, and analysis into new types of datasets. However, the cost to clean, transform, and analyze these new datasets is high, and every company is forced to do the same bespoke work on the same data sources. This is significant time and cost, and impeding the mission around expanding financial inclusion.

# Senior Data Scientist

### **The Role**

At Pave, you will have the opportunity to develop the foundational systems, tools, and processes the next generation of fintech startups are being built upon. We‚Äôre constructing the insights layer that lives between raw fintech data sources and the applications ingesting them.

We are looking for a data scientist with a strong background in data infrastructure, ML, and NLP. Our ideal candidate is someone who is eager to build models that are ready to meet the growing needs of our customers. We are forging our platform (scaling from millions of transactions to billions!) and you will have direct influence over the systems and architecture we implement.

On a day to day basis, you will work with our product and engineering teams to develop unique methodologies to solve challenging problems--can we predict account overdrafts? Can we build a loan default risk model? Can we recommend spending budgets for a given user?

You‚Äôll be leading data science projects from start to finish, so you should be ready to:

- Articulate and translate product questions into analysis. You‚Äôll be asked to define the objectives of new analyses you‚Äôre conducting and how they get Pave closer to our product goals
- Dig into the data! Strong data-querying skills (SQL and/or Spark, etc.), classification skills (tagging, etc.), and experience with a scripting language for data processing and development (Python, R, etc.) are a necessity to succeed in this role. Experience with financial data is a plus!
- Prototype ML models. You‚Äôll have access to vast quantities of data and a blank canvas to construct models the way you‚Äôve always wanted to
- Explain your decision making process. While we‚Äôre technical, we‚Äôre not all statisticians, so you should feel comfortable explaining difficult statistical topics and why you chose to implement them
- Establish performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of your projects
- Push it into production! After all that work, you should be ready to collaborate with engineering to get the you model implemented in production

### **The Team**

We‚Äôre an 8 person team of hungry, mission driven individuals bent on leveling the playing field of financial services. We‚Äôre a small team (though not for long!) looking for someone with strong programming skills to have an active hand in defining our company‚Äôs culture. You‚Äôll be a great fit if:

- You‚Äôre a team player, always ready to talk through hard questions and give feedback
- You‚Äôre a self-starter who is eager to get things done
- You‚Äôre excited to be involved in all aspects of the product
- You‚Äôre scrappy! You love proactively finding solutions to problems and you‚Äôve got a get-it-done mindset

1b4ahbh,Career Prospects for PhD with no SWE experience," 

I'll be earning a PhD in computational math about a year from now, and I'm starting to think about career options related to ML/data science. However, I don't really have a good grasp of what kinds of roles I could get hired for (and what compensation looks like for these roles), or what I'd need to add to my skillset in order to get hired.

My research has largely been unrelated to ML, but I think I'll be able to get a paper out before I graduate using vision transformers for applications to physics simulations. I will also have two research-based data science internships at national labs under my belt. I go to a top school for math/CS, and have good background in statistics, probability, linear algebra, and the math behind ML in general.

What worries me most about finding a job is that I know absolutely nothing about SWE or MLOps. I'm not really interested in SWE at all, and I've heard rumors that many ML Engineer roles are primarily SWE roles.

I can do easy leetcode problems, but would crash and burn if I was asked asked any harder medium to hard level questions. I'm hoping that there are good roles out there where I won't be expected to be a proficient SWE or leetcode robot: I am frankly not interested in learning SWE before starting a job. It is stressful enough working on a PhD, and I don't want to have to grind leetcode problems (something I find deeply uninteresting) in order to get past a first round interview.

Can ayone offer any insight into what sort of roles I'll be qualified for given my skillset and background? Do all ML-based roles tend to have an extensive leetcode DSA interview? What does compensation look like for someone in these roles? Will I have a difficult time finding anything in today's job market without the SWE experience or a ton of ML publications in top AI journals?

What Makes Braintrust Unique?

Braintrust's key value proposition is an efficient price discovery, made possible by its decentralized nature. Usually, companies don't have the time and resources to hire staff at their perceived market value, forcing them to acquire talent from middlemen like consulting firms. However, this talent comes with a significant mark-up. 

On Braintrust, a talent's price is influenced by their rate, skills and location. Talent placing bids must thoroughly list skills, set competitive prices and ensure locations align with existing client demand. Clients placing asks must offer competitive pay but keep required skills and experience broad enough to find enough matching talent. Simultaneously, expanding suitable time zones will increase the chances of success. 

Unlike centralized platforms, Braintrust does not charge talent fees. Clients are charged 10% of the total contract value, which is used to pay network operations costs. Since token holders vote on governance proposals, they decide the incentive structure for talent, allowing them to keep between 20% and 45% more of their earnings compared to traditional platforms. 

Clients profit from Braintrust's community-driven screening process and flexibly adjust to market demand by hiring competent freelancers instead of full-time employees. In doing this, they save between 50% and 75% compared to sourcing talent from external providers, according to Braintrust.

Connectors are incentivized to onboard their existing talent networks to the platform since they receive an increasing share of referrals' invoices from completed projects. 

--------------------------------------

Braintrust's mission is to build the world's most impactful talent Network -- One that is user owned, aligns incentives, and redistributes value to talent and organizations. At Braintrust, our decentralized talent network is built on the belief that everyone should be treated fairly. Fees should be transparent. Incentives should be aligned. And the huge percentages taken by middleman should be a thing of the past. This new model is uniquely enabled by a blockchain technology and the BTRST Token.",3,1,Rhemah777,2023-12-12 06:14:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearningJobs/comments/18gfd6c/new_talent_client_hiring_network/,0,machinelearningjobs

18d4s76,Working at the Chan Zuckerberg Imaging Institute?,"Hi everyone, I'm hoping to hear some opinions and general feelings about the environment of the Chan Zuckerberg Imaging Institute!

I recently got an interview for a machine learning software engineer towards a specific microscopy technique, which I have been specializing in during my PhD (the microscopy technique, not machine learning unfortunately). I've seen a lot of posts and feedback about CZI and Biohub, but not the more recently established Imaging Institute so I was hoping to get some feedback on what it's like to work here.

Firstly, will I get toasted in interviews for not being an ML expert? I'm an expert in the microscopy technique and different softwares for manual and automated image analysis, and I am comfortable with the CLI and Linux, have intermediate Python experience, and some MatLab experience, and am actively learning ML/AI programming in my free time, but I have never worked on a real project in the ML domain.

Next, does anyone have experience moving into an ML role from a non-ML role (specifically in a biomedical/biochemistry/biophysics research field)? I really love what I'm learning and am excited to move more into a ML/programming role for my field, but I can't lie it does seem rather intimidating.

Finally, I was wondering if anyone here works at or has worked at CZI/Biohub/Imaging Institute and would be willing to share their experience as part of this company, the environment there, and, if applicable, the technology platforms and SWE teams!

17dultg,Introductions to ML Jobs and me (themlc.ca),"HI all, My name is Ravi. I'm a  Senior Data Scientist with 15 years experience in Data Science. I'm great at coding too and work with all the major ML libraries. Pytorch, Huggingface, Tensorflow, Weights and Bias, Lang Chain, tensorboard, etc.

I wanted to share my company to anyone looking to incorporate AI into their business. If you have an idea I can build the AI for you !  [themlc.ca](https://themlc.ca) From my years of experience I've simplified the implementation phase for all Data Science projects into 3 easy steps.

Working with me you'll get my tried, tested, and proven implementation strategy.

In my experience alone I've built AI systems for 3 start-ups and 2 government bodies. I also have a team of Data Scientists (and growing) so we can build your AI with minimal trial and error! Allowing you to focus your time on the business.

Move out of ML and into AI keeping with State of the art techniques only seen by academics I have read and implemented the latest of them for years now.

Easiest thing to do is message and we can setup a quick 10 minute chat. [themlc.ca](https://themlc.ca)

wgzph6,[Hiring] Machine learning job: Senior AI Research Scientist at Earth Species Project (work from anywhere!),"The Earth Species Project (ESP) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to decoding animal communication and translating non-human language.

ESP partners with biologists and machine learning researchers at universities and institutions around the world and we are honored to be supported by many forward-looking philanthropists and groups, including the Internet Archive, TED Audacious 2020, and the entrepreneur and author Reid Hoffman.

Our work has been featured on NPR's Invisibilia documentary, ‚ÄúTwo Heart Beats a Minute,‚Äù ‚ÄúHow to Talk to Animals‚Äù in Wall Street Journal‚Äôs The Future of Everything, ‚ÄúThe Challenges of Animal Translation‚Äù in the New Yorker, published in Scientific Reports, and was honored at the inaugural Anthem Awards. 

We aim to enable every person to more deeply understand our co-inhabitants on Earth and in doing so, to permanently alter human perspective and culture.

Purpose of role
You will join an incredible and global remote team, and will be responsible for developing pioneering research towards decoding and translating non-human communication, including extending unsupervised translation techniques and tackling cornerstone biological and computational problems on large-scale multimodal behavioral datasets.
You will work with biology and machine learning experts to create understanding from new scopes and scales of data.
Responsibilities
Senior AI Research Scientists are responsible for developing and applying techniques in machine learning, bioacoustics, and ethology, disseminating their work in both scientific publications, and collaborating on these efforts with other members of the AI team as well as with external biology partners. In addition to your scientific work, you will be responsible for communicating your results with the team at ESP, as well as with the general public through non-technical publications such as blog posts. As ESP is still a growing team, you will have the ability to help shape our long-term research agenda.

You will have flexibility in the research that you conduct towards ESP‚Äôs mission to decode non-human communication. We offer plenty of GPU resources (including A100s) enough for training large ML models. 

Previous and ongoing research projects include:

End-to-end source separation (i.e., separating simultaneous sound sources in an audio recording into individual tracks) and noise reduction for challenging bioacoustic data
Use of self-supervised techniques to describe the vocal and behavioral repertoires of different animal species
Developing generative models for vocalization generation and editing
Developing large foundation models for application in bioacoustics

You will work with partners at various institutions including Cornell University, University of Oxford, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California Santa Cruz, University of St. Andrews, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, the Internet Archive, and the Jane Goodall Institute.

We are a fully remote team and you can be located anywhere in the world. This provides a good amount of flexibility, but you will occasionally be expected to participate in virtual meetings outside of typical working hours in your time zone. Additionally, you must have the willingness to travel internationally (",3,1,golangprojects,2022-08-05 16:24:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearningJobs/comments/wgzph6/hiring_machine_learning_job_senior_ai_research/,0,machinelearningjobs

bjnls6,"Looking for data scientists who are interested in launching a startup for ""genomics/nutritional data analysis/better AI/medicine data analysis""?","**Introduction:**  

  

I'm deep learning engineer who deals with image.  

  

I have understanding and knowledge on biology and neuroscience, nutrition, some medicine fields.  

  

I would like to do service which provides better suggestion for nutritional supplementary products  

using data science on personal medicine data, genomics, and collaborating with orthomolecular medicine experts and institutes.  

  

================================================================================  

**What I would like to do:**  

  

Hopefully, I would like to do wide and integrative range of medicine project which ultimately manages the health status of people, for example,  

  

1..check the health status and get health data and analyze it.  

  

2.. find better life style, dietary, supplements  

  

3.. those decisions will be managed by AI system, statistical model, data science as well as supervision of medicine experts  

  

4.. collaborate with fundamental researchers to find better understanding on the mechanism of nature  

Currently, there is often paradoxical conclusions in the even professional papers.  

For example, half of paper says eating 3 eggs is good for the health, and other half says it's bad.  

And half of papers says drinking coffee is good, and other half says it's bad.  

Some papers also say having cigarette is good for health cause it can reduce the stress of body.  

I don't doubt the capability of researchers but think this issue comes from various reasons; lack of budget, lack of research time, 

and human can't consider tons of factors at the same time.  

This is the point which I think big data and strong computing power driven medicine project can help this limitation out.  

Big data and strong computing power are the technologies which hadn't existed before. They're new technology and environment.  

It's obvious there will be advantages and paradigm shift and game changer on the companies which use those technologies in good way.

  

5.. more focus on preventive medicine, and collaborate with modern medicine, to help the severity of the disease,

and to check progress of disease, how patients response to the treatment prescribed by the experts, how prognosis will be.

  

================================================================================  

But I might start to analyze nutritional status data of patients, which is obtained saliva, blood, hair, nail, etc. 

And doctors will prescribe recommendation for nutritional supplements as auxiliary treatment.   

And I will create the model which analyze that status and which can evaluate how those prescription works as clear and objective numerical figures.  

&#x200B;

Since there are tons of nutritional factors, tons of disease, tons of status, it's difficult to find optimal recommendation for even medical doctors.  

Hope it can be helped by computer technology.  

&#x200B;

And doing this, I would like to expand kind of data which we can analyze towards genomic data, pathology slide image,   

antioxidant status, inflammation status, microbe status in the gut, etc and hope to be able to analyze their interactions.  

  

And I would like to make model which detects abnormal signal from big data as well as better AI system like artificial general intelligence.  

But AGI is just long term life project which is unsure if it can be created as most challenge project to even top AI companies.  

But I just hope that attempts will help the short term goal because developing AGI is the attempts to create new algorithm.  

  

To do that, first I need to find doctor who can collaborate with us.  

  

================================================================================  

**Project background:**  

  

I have read a lot of research papers on inflammation, oncology, autoimmune disease, diabetes, immunology, etc,  

which say the importance of nutritional aspects, for example,  

  

\- New perspectives of curcumin in cancer prevention  

[www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693758/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693758/)  

  

\- Selenium and Thyroid Disease: From Pathophysiology to Treatment  

[www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5307254/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5307254/)  

  

The idea comes from the fact that our body has elaborate curing mechanism  

And that curing mechanism is too complicated, and automatic feedback mechanism which has been optimized for millions of years to imitate them by humans.  

Even if modern medicines can't fully and actually cure every diseases if you know how the drugs work in terms of pharmacology; specifically key-lock theory, 

it's amazing that body itself can cure the disease as long as it's not too Irreversibly late.  

  

================================================================================  

**Skills which are supposed to be used to deal with the project:**  

  

\- Bayesian Probabilistic Model  

\- Probabilistic Graphical Model  

\- Monte Carlo Tree Search  

\- Reinforcement Learning  

\- Neuroscience mechanism based AI coding  

\- Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Visualization  

\- Deep Learning (CNN, RNN, Classification, Linear regression)  

\- Machine Learning (Supervised, Unsupervised, GAN)  

\- Fast responsive for discussion via email or private channel  

&#x200B;

================================================================================  

**What we can start**  

&#x200B;

\- Discuss what specific project we need to do  

\- Discuss how to build the team up  

\- Try public data science competitions via Kaggle, Grand Challenge",3,4,youngmindev,2019-05-01 22:45:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearningJobs/comments/bjnls6/looking_for_data_scientists_who_are_interested_in/,0,machinelearningjobs

The thing is I thing this is a big scale project is it possible to learn how to do it alone as an intern.

They want something similar to travel moji or trip planner AI. Which basically recommend fully planned trips based on user profile.

So my big question is is it possible to do this as a junior developer? and if so how what models should I use and how to use them?

Please any advice would be highly appreciated. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this if you have any advice please don't hesitate.",2,1,zoyafromthemoon,2024-03-06 06:36:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearningJobs/comments/1b7t0n0/asking_for_advice_about_a_job/,0,machinelearningjobs

I've been looking for the past few months but I'm having a hard time getting initial interviews post resume screens as well.

Should I change my CV to say Machine Learning Engineer for my current role, or does listing it as a Data Scientist bring more prestige?

1aqd920,Seeking Advice: Cloud Certification for AI/ML Career Path,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently pursuing a Master's in AI and have a year of experience as a software developer. As I'm aspiring to break into machine learning/AI or data science roles, I've been contemplating adding a cloud certification to my portfolio. Given the significance of cloud infrastructure in deploying AI models and handling big data, I'm considering the Google Associate Cloud Engineer certification. However, with the rising popularity of Microsoft's cloud solutions, I'm at a crossroads.

My primary goal is to enhance my employability and secure a well-paying job in the AI/ML or data science domain. While I have a few projects under my belt, I believe a cloud certification could potentially make my resume stand out.

I'm seeking advice on a few fronts:

1. **Relevance of Cloud Certifications**: How beneficial is a cloud certification, specifically for someone aiming for AI/ML or data science roles? Does it significantly impact job prospects?
2. **Google Cloud vs. Microsoft Azure**: Given the industry trends and job market demands, would you recommend Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure? Or is there another platform I should consider?
3. **Investment Worth**: Considering the time and financial investment, do you think pursuing a cloud certification is a strategic move for someone with my background and goals?

Any insights, experiences, or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. I'm here to learn from those who've navigated similar paths or have insights into the industry trends.

Im a freshman in communications and information technology engineering (we have an AI concentration (i.e. bunch of ai related electives) in year 4, so im considering a career in this) and I have very superficial experience with anything related to AI. Thaimt being said, im planning to study neural networks as well as a couple of coursera/udemy technical courses related to data preprocessing, ML and DL next summer. So the question is, will this give me any chance in interning in a position related to this field by the next summer? or is that too far fetched?

TLDR: im a freshman whos planning to take AI-related courses and self study a lot next summer, will i be able to land an internship the summer after that?

It's temporary (24 months). However, I have started securing investments, and the plan is to hire permanently after the period ends. My plan is to continue building a strong ML team with which to transform the AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) industry and I have the support of CEO and all of the main company stakeholders. There's lots to do, few people to do it, and there are leaner environments -- don't expect being in Google. However, I think there's space to do very interesting stuff, and I aim to also participate in conferences and write publications. We will collaborate with two BCU senior lecturers and possibly have the help of MSc/PhD students in addition to other BH's personnel. The company is nice and has authored nice open source initiatives like the BHoM (https://github.com/BHoM).

I would love to get someone with some industry experience (internships count). Essentials are: experience in training ML models, in particular NNs via ML frameworks like PyTorch; ideally computer vision experience, and possibly some IR (Information Retrieval) experience. Proficiency in Python and ideally some experience in an OOP language like C#. Having used cloud providers (especially Azure) would be nice, same as being appreciative of ML deployment challenges.

I put life over work at all times and never expect overtime, which I very rarely do. The proposed initial pay is not great, not much I could do on that, but I will do my best to push it further up during negotiations for strong candidates. We do offer benefits. We haven't had many women applying so far, I encourage minorities to apply. I personally particularly value individuals with strong ethics and sensibility.

What Makes Braintrust Unique?

Braintrust's key value proposition is an efficient price discovery, made possible by its decentralized nature. Usually, companies don't have the time and resources to hire staff at their perceived market value, forcing them to acquire talent from middlemen like consulting firms. However, this talent comes with a significant mark-up. 

On Braintrust, a talent's price is influenced by their rate, skills and location. Talent placing bids must thoroughly list skills, set competitive prices and ensure locations align with existing client demand. Clients placing asks must offer competitive pay but keep required skills and experience broad enough to find enough matching talent. Simultaneously, expanding suitable time zones will increase the chances of success. 

Unlike centralized platforms, Braintrust does not charge talent fees. Clients are charged 10% of the total contract value, which is used to pay network operations costs. Since token holders vote on governance proposals, they decide the incentive structure for talent, allowing them to keep between 20% and 45% more of their earnings compared to traditional platforms. 

Clients profit from Braintrust's community-driven screening process and flexibly adjust to market demand by hiring competent freelancers instead of full-time employees. In doing this, they save between 50% and 75% compared to sourcing talent from external providers, according to Braintrust.

Connectors are incentivized to onboard their existing talent networks to the platform since they receive an increasing share of referrals' invoices from completed projects. 

--------------------------------------

Braintrust's mission is to build the world's most impactful talent Network -- One that is user owned, aligns incentives, and redistributes value to talent and organizations. At Braintrust, our decentralized talent network is built on the belief that everyone should be treated fairly. Fees should be transparent. Incentives should be aligned. And the huge percentages taken by middleman should be a thing of the past. This new model is uniquely enabled by a blockchain technology and the BTRST Token.",2,1,Rhemah777,2023-12-13 04:41:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearningJobs/comments/18h8ryt/job_network_that_connects_ai_tech_individuals/,0,machinelearningjobs

yp2xbn,[Hiring] Fully Remote Data Scientist (NLP),"Hey everyone,

We're looking for an experienced data scientist to join our small data team, and I'm hoping to tap into the community rather than recruiters. High-level stats: we've been in business for over 20 years ‚Äì we're in the top-5 of our segment, we're 100% fully remote, and we keep EST hours. Our team is focused on using ML (NLP, recommendations) for efforts like extracting signal from unstructured text (e.g., slot filling, classification), enhancing our recommendation/matching pipeline, and modeling our segment of the market.

I'm someone who's worked in some FAANG-types, some startups, and in academia, and there are a few qualities that I appreciate in particular about this role:

* the technical challenges we work on feel like the fundamental NLU research tasks that I worked on in grad school, except without concern for arbitrary novelty or SOA-bake-off games. These are topics a lot of us are interested in, but usually when we find a company working on them, the interesting decisions have already been made ‚Äì that's not the case here. I'm able to explore what is, for me, the substantial intersection between my interests and the company's technical needs
* the data team has the freedom and independence to do our work properly and to generate results we believe in. We do maintain a good delivery cadence and we apply ""all the adages"" (e.g., don't let perfect be the enemy of the good), but (1) respect and trust are extremely strong between teams and (2) deliverables are kept small and are usually POCs or MVPs that we want to evaluate experimentally
* No blood in the water ‚Äì no one is competitive or cutthroat; we're all ""pulling in the same direction"" and it feels that way. Nothing is territorial and our existing team does its job well ‚Äì work/life balance is as good as any full-time role can be 
* We have a lot of data and the resources to analyze it pragmatically
* Competitive compensation

To succeed here, I think the list above should sound appealing ‚Äì and, of course, that's not everyone. Some people are happiest working onsite, some personalities enjoy a collegial but competitive atmosphere, etc., but for a certain set of sensibilities, this role offers, what has been for me, a unique opportunity.

As far as technical background, real-world proficiency with these will be helpful:

* Transformer-based NLP models like BERT for tasks like text and token classification as well as entity extraction
* Python (we tend to share work in Jupyter notebooks)
* ML libraries like some of these ‚Äì NumPy, pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, SpaCy, fast.ai, XGBoost, PyMC3
* PyTorch or TensorFlow (experience with Huggingface in particular is relevant)
* Tasks like classification, clustering, efficient matching, outlier/anomaly detection, churn analysis, LTV analysis

Also relevant:

* Interpretability (e.g., Shapley values, similarity measures)
* Model optimization (GPU/CPU, inference/training, distillation)
* SQL, Bash
* US Citizen, able to work EST hours

Feel free to DM me with any comments or questions.",2,5,MontyCarleau,2022-11-07 22:31:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearningJobs/comments/yp2xbn/hiring_fully_remote_data_scientist_nlp/,0,machinelearningjobs

vjs9wa,[Hiring] Machine learning job: Full Stack Machine Learning Engineer at Roboflow (work from anywhere in US!),"Roboflow is hiring our third full-time engineer on the machine learning team to contribute to the core machine learning tools and infrastructure that underpin the Roboflow platform. This role will inevitably involve wearing a lot of hats. Wide-ranging curiosity and enthusiasm for diving into abstract problems, coming up with good solutions, and seeing them through to completion are essential responsibilities.

Our core belief is that computer vision is a foundational technology that is going to transform nearly every industry. This is an opportunity to shape how millions of developers will experience and use it for the first time. Your contribution will have a massive impact.

We anticipate the role being focused 60% on backend, 20% on machine learning, and 20% on other areas. You certainly don't need to be an expert in all of these areas; but should be excited to learn new skill sets as you need them. We also hope you'll bring some new knowledge and experiences you can share to help level-up the rest of the team. The above tools span code in our machine learning stack to date - your opinions on new technologies that we adapt for new tasks will be highly valued.

What We Need From You

On the machine learning team, we primarily work on building and maintaining technology within Roboflow‚Äôs training, search and deployment services, but from time to time we're also helping deliver on enterprise contracts, and coding awesome open source projects and sample projects.

In the beginning, you will be tackling projects in close collaboration with your fellow machine learning and product team members. As you progress in your knowledge of Roboflow‚Äôs mission and tools, you will have a wide degree of freedom to advocate for and drive your own projects. If you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably won't be a good fit.

We‚Äôre especially keen to add some rigor to our processes and build the foundation for scaling the engineering organization and the machine learning team.

Technology

Our goal is to build the world's best computer vision infrastructure so our users don't have to. This means we handle a lot of challenging complexities like seamlessly ingesting dozens of data formats, processing millions of images per day, and deploying auto-scaling machine learning infrastructure that can handle our customers' most demanding training and deployment needs.

Our core app sits atop Firebase with assistance from auto-scaling groups of Docker containers (for jobs like archiving datasets and training models). We also heavily lean on serverless infrastructure so we can gracefully deal with bursty traffic involved in manipulating datasets that can range anywhere from one hundred to one million images.

Our machine learning infrastructure runs in AWS, with a few deployments spanning into GCP. We train and deploy various state of the art models in a variety of machine learning frameworks. All of our machine learning applications are closely integrated with the core Roboflow web application.

We also maintain a library of Colab notebooks our customers can use to train common computer vision models, a directory of public datasets, and a web of format specifications. We see building and supporting mini-projects like these that are helpful to the community at large as part of our role in democratizing computer vision.

Skills
        Backend: node, Docker, python, Flask, pip, REST
        Machine Learning: PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, OpenVINO, TensorRT, TFjs
        Mobile: Swift iOS, Kotlin/Java Android
        AWS: EC2, ECR, ECS, Lambda, Cloud Watch, Batch, S3
        Google Cloud: Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, PubSub, GCE
        Frontend: Firebase, React, jQuery, HTML, CSS

Example Projects
        Building the conversion scripts, inference scripts, and SDK for mobile deployment 
        Implementing more robust inference usage tracking, reporting, and analytics
        Expanding the capabilities and scope of the Roboflow REST API and PIP Package
        Building a dashboard where users can track their model deployments
        Ensuring uptime of training and inference infrastructure
        Creating a multi-region compute waterfall in AWS to ensure the highest level of GPU availability for our customers wishing to train
        Sharding our inference functions to serve an ever growing user base

sletda,[Hiring] Machine learning job: Data Scientist at Meliora Therapeutics (work from anywhere in US!),"Mission
Biotech is on the verge of a revolution. Fundamental breakthroughs and foundational new technologies have resulted in the lowering of genome sequencing costs, the advent of CRISPR, and increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms. These developments are unleashing the ability to interrogate human biology in unprecedented ways. However, the biotech industry and drug development industry have yet to bring these latest cutting edge developments to bear. 97% of cancer drugs that enter the clinic never get approved, resulting from a lack of efficacy or toxic side effects indicating a lack of understanding of true underlying mechanisms of actions.

Meliora Therapeutics‚Äô vision as a cancer therapeutics company is to bring the latest advancements across molecular biology and computational methods together in order to fight cancer. We believe that by building a world class, diverse, multi disciplinary team we have the opportunity to create new therapies that significantly improve clinical outcomes through developing the first true multi-omics target discovery and development platform. The founding team of Meliora includes scientific founder Dr. Jason Sheltzer (Faculty at Yale School of Medicine, Presidential Early Career Award, Forbes 30u30), Joan Smith (Sr. Staff engineer at Google, MIT Physics), Zach Owen (Sr. Data Scientist at Verily, previous ML startup technical co-founder, MIT PhD), and CEO David Li (1st business hire at Benchling, GS, KKR, Penn Life Sciences and Management). The science on which the company was founded was completed in Jason‚Äôs lab and published in Science Translational Medicine in 2019 and further written up in the New York Times. Meliora is backed by top life science and tech investors.

Responsibilities
    Bring your computational skills to bear on a critical problem in cancer treatment: why 97% of cancer drugs fail in clinical trials
    Propose, develop, and validate novel methods of associating drugs with their true mechanism of action.
    Iteratively, experimentally, and scientifically develop a pipeline on existing, publicly available data to select drugs for further exploration in the lab.
    Be willing to grow and learn. Deep expertise in genomics isn‚Äôt necessary to start with, but you will need to be comfortable building an extensive background in the field as we go.
    Be a culture setter by embodying the company‚Äôs principles of truth-seeking, mutual respect, integrity, drive, and teamwork.

Qualifications
    Bachelor's degree or equivalent experience in quantitative field (Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering, etc.)
    Experience conducting in-depth data analysis in industrial or academic settings using Python and Pandas (preferred) or R
    Expertise in using machine learning techniques to analyze and gain insight from biological or other data with libraries, such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, and Jax.

nnthq0,[Hiring] Machine learning job: Machine Learning Engineer at Ntropy Network (work from anywhere!) | Salary: $130k - $180k ‚Ä¢ 0.1% - 1.2%,"Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratising some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our first product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible with minimal engineering overhead to both humans and machine-learning models in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We are currently looking for founding machine learning and back-end engineers to join our team.

We
are allergic to over-engineering.
are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out ‚Äúpats on the back‚Äù. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results. 
are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn‚Äôt exist yet, we will build it.
have a sense of humour (well, we think we do).

As a founding member of our team, you will help
push the limits of cutting-edge computing and machine learning
build the team and drive the direction of the company.
shape our product and culture.
assemble our engineering stack.
experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people‚Äôs financial lives.

What will be my role?
We are mostly looking for ML and backend engineers at the moment. However, if you are excited by the vision and believe you will be a good fit, we would love to talk!

Who else is on the team?
We are 6 people at the moment, 2 (ops / biz) + 4 engineers: Nare, Ilia, David, Chady, Misak, Jonathan.

Where is Ntropy located?
We are fully remote, with a virtual base in San Francisco, CA.

What time-zones do you work with?
We hire anywhere in the time zones GMT-8 to GMT+1.

Do you consider part-time work?
Not at the moment. Full-time roles only.

How are you funded?
We are backed by some of the top fintech investors in the world. Have raised single-digit millions of dollars so far. Can share more details over the call.

Do you already have a product?
Currently in beta with 20+ customers.

Do you plan to sell customer data?
Ntropy is on a mission to enable products without data barriers. We will never sell customer data and will always put privacy and customer benefit ahead of any auxiliary financial gains.

What is the interview process like?
If we mutually feel we can build great stuff together, at least on paper, we will do a video call to kick things off and screenshare your favourite side project (45 mins).
We will then give you a take-home project related to whatever we are currently working on (6 hours project + 1 hour discussion).
If all goes well, we will set up a group call with the rest of the team to nerd out and generally spend time together (2 hours).

Above all, we respect your time and commitment and will keep you up to speed on where we are during the entire process.

What are your hiring plans?
We aim to be 10-12 people in the next 6 months. Mostly technical positions. We are hiring as slowly as possible to build our mojo.

What is your current stack?
back-end - Python + Rust (where performance matters)
compute - AWS + GCP
ML - Python (Pytorch)

Work / life balance?
At the current stage of the company, our probability of success is directly correlated to effort. The number of hours you put in can make a big difference. However, if we cannot rely on your presence at all times, we must surely be able to rely on your outcomes, no matter how much time it takes. Mental and physical wellbeing are above anything else.

m5u20x,[Hiring] Machine learning job: Machine Learning Engineer at Promaton (work from anywhere in Europe!),"The models you make robust and performant are at the heart of the innovation we‚Äôre bringing to the dental market, to raise the standard of healthcare

Promaton is changing dental healthcare by automating diagnostics and treatment workflows using AI, making healthcare more affordable and accessible for everyone. Did you know dentists miss up to 30% of pathologies on an X-Ray? We are on a mission to eliminate errors in dentistry by improving diagnostic accuracy, and automating mundane work like creating 3D models by hand from an X-Ray. 

You'll be:

Making our resource heavy AI pipelines work as performant as possible
Creating tooling and infrastructure that give us insight into the inference and training performance
Managing the AI model lifecycle
You'll be working with an accomplished team of data scientists and machine learning engineers, that already have 8 patents on their name, and created market leading algorithms that are in use throughout the world.

The challenges you'll help us overcome:
Medical AI has to comply with the highest quality standards. While in other industries failing to predict for example a recommended product has little consequence, in the medical field you really don't want to be wrong. Safety-critical AI is a hard topic.
All our products process large images, from 5 up to 700MB. This means that a lot of off-the-shelve tooling doesn't work for us, and we need to invent our own to process and manage our data.
We are a cloud-native company, and cloud-native ML frameworks are still in their early days. You'll help us navigate the ever evolving ecosystem of tools, to make sure we find the right balance between off-the-shelf and home-grown tooling. 

The perks of working at Promaton:
üí∞ Excellent employment terms
üè° Freedom to work from anywhere you like (and any time you like). We only have a few touch points.
üë©‚Äçüî¨ Dedicated time for hackathons and research, to explore new ideas of your own. We have a quarterly ""hack for a week on anything you like"" and a monthly paper review sessions, where we present the latest developments in the field to each other.
üéì Real training budget for books and conferences or anything else you need to grow
üöÄ Work with the latest technology, on the forefront of a rapidly changing field in medical imaging AI
üí™ Loads of responsibility and autonomy (we hate micro management) and a chance to make a real impact
üèñ Awesome yearly company retreat, and quarterly team events
‚õ∫Ô∏è 25 days of annual leave
üíª Top-notch gear, and even bigger servers to play with
üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Promaton is funded for many years to come, meaning you can have the impact you only get at a startup, but with the job security of an established company
üõ¨ For all international engineers: Promaton is recognized as a visa sponsor by the Dutch government
Job requirements
To apply for this job, we have a couple of hard requirements:

2 years experience in bringing AI Models to production, preferably in computer vision.
4 years experience working with Python 
Computer science level degree or equivalent degree with a strong mathematical foundation

Bonus points:

You've worked on model architecture
Experience with application / microservice development
Experience with AWS or Kubernetes deployment

iiqn5q,Do you have a little time to share knowledge? I want to hear from you,"Do you have time for a quick meeting? I want to learn from you. Just the university studies are never enough and I want to learn about the people already in the field.

You don't have to be an expert, all you need is have the willingness to share some of your knowledge and / or experience with a very passionate person that will surely appreciate your time and advise.

**My story:** it's 2020, I am married with 3 kids and just lost my job while still at the university. So this puts me in a pickle: I can't continue to study and really want to start in a Data Science role this time, so I kept my work schedule to learn by myself but I would also like to learn what they don't teach you in school: interview questions, what tools do you normally use, every day issues and how you solve them.",2,2,data_mad_scientist,2020-08-29 11:08:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearningJobs/comments/iiqn5q/do_you_have_a_little_time_to_share_knowledge_i/,0,machinelearningjobs

The simple idea is

1. user accesses the landing page and uploads an excel file of annual sales and inventory.

2. GPT passes the excel file to the server to perform appropriate analyses (e.g. EDA analysis).

3. expose the data analysed in 2. above in the form of an input form on the landing page.

1bq1jes,"Jobs,domains and specialisations in the ml industry"," 

I'm just curious what kinda areas specifically you guys like or jobs you have more of an affiliation towards than others. Most job descripitions I look at for AI/ML, just give a pretty *general* view of what they expect from you, they don't really go into **specific** areas of expertise.

My questions basically ask:

What kinda models do you guys like more? Generative ai,Reinforcement learning,etc, or maybe something completely unrelated like time series forcasting?

What **sectors** do you gravitate more towards other than tech, like healthcare, finance or energy?

Also, what type of companies require more *general* DS knowledge rather than something more **complex**, like manually implementing backprop, or doing gradient descent by hand?

Context : Currently just doing the pre-reqs for ML/AI, - calculus,linear algebra and stats, and getting a more advanced understanding of python, so still deciding which area of ML to **really specialize** in.

1bpallb,I'm transitioning from being a supply chain manager to a freelancer data scientist/analyst to tackle demand forecasting in supply chain management using machine learning!,"I have worked in supply chain management for years, demand forecasting was always about pulling the historical data off the ERP system and trying to speculate the future demand on Excel sheet.

I know Excel is powerful, you can still use pivot table to aggregate the number, categorize them, probably make some charts for report. But not until I started learning Python language and machine learning algorithms, I realize you can make beautiful plots just using couple lines of code and let the forecasting models take care of the prediction.

It's not been widely adopted by the many companies and since I'm self-taught without a ML degree ( although I have a business degree with domain knowledge) I will probably face some challenges.
