hohvgq,Shout Out to All the Mediocre Data Scientists Out There,"I've been lurking on this sub for a while now and all too often I see posts from people claiming they feel inadequate and then they go on to describe their stupid impressive background and experience. That's great and all but I'd like to move the spotlight to the rest of us for just a minute. Cheers to my fellow mediocre data scientists who don't work at FAANG companies, aren't pursing a PhD, don't publish papers, haven't won Kaggle competitions, and don't spend every waking hour improving their portfolio.  Even though we're nothing special, we still deserve some appreciation every once in a while.

ljftgi,"I created a four-page Data Science Cheatsheet to assist with exam reviews, interview prep, and anything in-between","Hey guys, I’ve been doing a lot of preparation for interviews lately, and thought I’d compile a document of theories, algorithms, and models I found helpful during this time. Originally, I was just keeping notes in a Google Doc, but figured I could create something more permanent and aesthetic.

It covers topics (some more in-depth than others), such as:

* Distributions
* Linear and Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees and Random Forest
* SVM
* KNN
* Clustering
* Boosting
* Dimension Reduction (PCA, LDA, Factor Analysis)
* NLP
* Neural Networks
* Recommender Systems
* Reinforcement Learning
* Anomaly Detection

The four-page Data Science Cheatsheet can be found [here](https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet/blob/main/Data_Science_Cheatsheet.pdf), and I hope it's helpful to those looking to review or brush up on machine learning concepts. Feel free to leave any suggestions and star/save the PDF for reference.

mmzbgq,I just got offered a data science internship with Amazon. I've been lurking on the sub for 3 years and just wanted to thank the folks who put together stats/ml cheat sheets.,"This sub really motivated me to take my undergraduate degree in biomathematics/statistics and turn it into a masters in data science. I use to think I wouldn't have the programing background or that I wouldn't have the technical skills people wanted. It took a lot of my moving past my imposter syndrome as a woman in stem and working on my skill set but I've gotten this far. Thank you all so much.

Edit: Just came back to this post and saw all the support. For any one interested i have been applying since September to internships and have since then applied to 83 positions, reworked my resume twice, ended up making my own website for my projects just to look better on paper, and got 5 interviews at the end of March. I have gotten offers so far from every place I interviewed at and used the smaller offers to ask Amazon to give me a decision earlier, which ended up working. I only did 2 interviews with Amazon before I got my team and offer, which from reading online isn't common as they usually have a 3rd or 4th interview for interns. Its been a long process and a battle at every stage. Just 2 weeks ago I was resigned to the idea of a summer with no internship, but here we are now.",1890,91,BluntButter,2021-04-08 19:22:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mmzbgq/i_just_got_offered_a_data_science_internship_with/,1,datascience

umse6v,"I got 4 Data Science job offers with salaries between $100k - $150k in a single week, and I have a degree in English Literature","I have 3 years experience as a Data Analyst and a certificate (not a degree) an online Data Science program. Those are pretty weak credentials, and I'm sure I'm not the only person with that kind of background that starts the job search thinking there's no chance anyone would ever hire me.

I wanted to share what worked for me, just in case it can work for anybody else.

Basically, it's this:

**Treat the job interview like you're selling a service**

What worked for me was to stop thinking of it as a job interview.

Instead, imagine that you're the sales rep for a Data company answering an RFP. A client has a problem and they need a solution. You're just there to demonstrate that you can implement it.

Try to figure out what problem they're trying to solve with this role before the interview begins. That might be something like: ""We have data but we don't know how to get meaning out of it"" or ""We need to re-architect our data"" or even just: ""We have a guy who does a great job, but we need two of him.""

Center everything you say around the key message of: ""I know what your problem is and I know how to solve it.""

When they ask you to tell them about yourself:

1. Focus your answer on demonstrating that you have experience solving problems like theirs
2. Wrap it up by saying you were interested in the job because you got the impression that they need that problem solved, and you have a lot of experience solving that problem
3. Ask the interviewer if you're on the right about what problem they need solved

It's fine if you've totally misread the company. The point is that, when you ask that question, early in the interview, you force the interviewer to explain what they want the person who takes the role to be able to do.

It also switches the whole dynamic of the interview. Instead of them asking you questions, it's now about you troubleshooting that problem.

Respond by:

1. Asking clarifying questions about the problem they have
2. Explaining how you would approach the problem
3. Describing past similar projects you've worked on and how you solved them
4. Highlighting the business impact of your solutions

Doing this made a *massive* difference in my job search. I didn't hear back from any job I applied to until I tried this approach, but I heard back from everybody after I did.",1865,293,takenorinvalid,2022-05-10 20:49:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/umse6v/i_got_4_data_science_job_offers_with_salaries/,0,datascience

tag8l5,My Guide To Writing A Killer Cover Letter,"Most people think a cover letter is about themselves. This isn’t true.

A cover letter is a marketing tool. Treat it like one and you’ll see it do wonders. Treat it like an autobiography and you’ll wonder why no one gets back to you.

Here’s the cover letter formula that got me my current job:

1. **Analyzing the job description**
2. **Identifying what to include in your cover letter**
3. **Why do you want to work here?**
4. **Writing the cover letter**

**Before we get started:** this is a long post (\~3000 words). If you'd rather get a free PDF copy of it, feel free to [drop your email](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe) here and I'll be sending it next week. 

**1/ Analyzing the job description**

Always write a cover letter from scratch. It's better to apply for five relevant positions with a complementing cover letter than to apply for fifty positions without any background research.

The best way to do this is to start by analyzing the job description.

A job description is composed of two parts:

1. What you’ll do
2. What the company is looking for (i.e qualifications)

First, focus on the “what you’ll do” portion. The first few bullets are the most important. And we need to make sure that they’re addressed in our cover letter. Start highlighting the ones you have experience carrying out.

https://preview.redd.it/pbakyc28yem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee3a2be51ee0c9d009f81068868ee28064271904

Next, take a look at the qualifications. Note down the ones you can comfortably meet and ignore any you don’t. We also want to highlight the ‘preferred’ or ‘nice-to-have’ items listed in the job posting if you satisfy those.

*Quick note: Qualifications are always negotiable and should never deter you from applying if you think you’re almost there but missing a few requirements.*

https://preview.redd.it/s1yfj6n9yem81.png?width=3424&format=png&auto=webp&s=282abefe6281837a26d748131dbb9aca1daba54d

Make sure to note all these skills you’ve highlighted in the job description down. We’re now ready to move onto our next step.

**2/ Identifying what to include in your cover letter**

Create a table with two columns. In the left column jot down the highlighted skills you identified in the above section. And now in the right column, start writing down how you can match up to the advertised qualifications.

Here’s an example for my latest role. Notice how I try to use as many of the same words as the job description:

https://preview.redd.it/xhalvb7byem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=76992f4e46b66a259504c8fb0bcc2f1ec6fca3ab

For now, just put down the qualifications without any regard for style. Also, you don’t need qualifications for all the requirements. We’re only going to use the top two anyway.

Struggling to come up with qualifications? Try to ask your co-workers or peers about projects they’ve enjoyed working with you on. Keeping a [brag document](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/howtobragatwork) can also be really helpful.

And try to speak the employer’s language. So if a job description mentions “QuickBooks,” don’t just say you’ve used “accounting software”.

**3/ Why do you want to work here?**

You’re a great fit for the role. Now you have to convince them that you want to work there.

Realize that this is just a research based question. If you do enough research, you will find information about the company that you can link back to your own interests and goals.

To help you do research, ask yourself the following questions:

* What is the company’s mission?
* What problem are they trying to solve?
* What’s the product?
* What’s unique about this company compared to its competitors?
* What are some policies or values that the company has that they feature on their homepage?
* Describe any of the organization’s community engagement projects or employee development programs.

A great place to find more info is to look at interviews that their founders or executives have done. Another is the company’s blog.

Once you’ve done your research, list out *why* you find each answer to the above questions appealing. What is it about rockets that appeals to you? Why is a video messaging platform one you can connect with?

And if you’ve been using their product, that enthusiasm will shine through. It’s not mandatory and it’s not even common, but when it does happen, you have a great reason for why you want to work at the company.

*Sidenote: I'm going to release a complete guide on researching companies before the interview soon. If you'd like to read that you can* [*subscribe*](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe) *here* *and get it when it's released.*

**4/ Writing the cover letter**

We’re going to use the following format for your cover letter:

*(i) Who you are, what you want, and what you believe in.*

*(ii) Transition*

*(iii). Skill & Qualification Match*

*(vi) Why do you want to work there?*

*(v) Conclusion*

***(i) Who you are, what you want, and what you believe in***

Use the first one or two sentences to make some statements about who you are, what you want, and what you believe in. Here are some good examples:

https://preview.redd.it/7tjx90ueyem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c769a4c46e74c14d1b52b995177237b3569ba76

Emphasize your strengths and also ideally mention something specific to the company.

***(ii) Transition***

I like to link the intro in my cover letter to the first skill-qualification match by having a summary statement and attaching it to a generic sentence:

https://preview.redd.it/65imjsigyem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=edfa8b0ec98b32708cca1db7b2c56c1b46b6fde5

The first sentence summarizes what you will bring to the company. The second helps flow into the experiences you’re about to write about.

Mine would be:

*Over the last 12 months, I’ve helped my company generate over $X in revenue by leading meetings with executive leaders and also built a variety of web applications on the side.*

*And now I’m excited to continue my journey by contributing and growing at Adyen. There are three things that make me the perfect fit for this position:*

Here are some examples that differentiate weak and better summary statements:

https://preview.redd.it/2hssbb2iyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=09585eef6003225bfc97c0cd38d5dc122af93b0a

Avoid jargon and get specific. Half the words, twice the examples. Ideally with a few numbers sprinkled in.

*Quick Note: The summary statement is also great to add to the top of your Linkedin bio.*

***(ii) Skill & Qualification Match***

Go back to your table matching your qualifications to the requirements. Pick the two most important ones.

We’re going to link your qualifications to a theme. And then use that to transform your boring bullet points into exciting sentences.

Here are eight common interview story themes:

1. Leading People
2. Taking initiative
3. Affinity for challenging work
4. Affinity for different types of work
5. Affinity for specific work
6. Dealing with failure
7. Managing conflict
8. Driven by curiosity

Let's say we ended up with the below table when analyzing a specific job description.

https://preview.redd.it/5zl2adfkyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=da38789ff4180a422a237027d1dd4827993f1dca

And let’s take our first qualification:

*Conducted Feature-Mapping and Requirements Gathering sessions with prospective and existing clients to formulate Scope and Backlog. Responsible for managing and creating backlog, writing stories and acceptance criteria for all managed projects.*

Let’s figure out how we can link this to one of the interview story themes:

https://preview.redd.it/mikhhw0myem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=8057bf24031ebb66a10d21aac45f5f5836bf6ed8

And here's another example:

https://preview.redd.it/otukv2rnyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=d242ebd6f3764b64ce49d530a8a22df03ddfad97

So what we’ve done here is abstracted some themes from this person’s actual qualifications.

I know this isn't super scientific. More themes than just one work for most qualifications. But the goal is to help you solidify the type of story you want to tell.

And now that you have your theme, you can use it to guide your body paragraphs using this format:

https://preview.redd.it/hkdahc9pyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=7003513dacbe9704ed3a8b8c430f1932d4d0706a

Some more examples:

https://preview.redd.it/cql1thksyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=663d5c64f7cc9d4e63fcd37fdf0bda1358ebbdfc

***(vi) Why do you want to work there?***

Pick your two most favorite aspects about the company that you already found when doing your research. I like to pick one value driven one and one industry or current topic related. If you use their product, though, that should be first on your list.

If you want to check out some examples for this, you can do that [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.32.png), [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.40.png), and [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.48.png).

Now that you’ve got two reasons, it’s time to craft together a simple paragraph that weaves them together:

*Third, I’ve been following \[COMPANY\] for a couple of months now and I resonate with both the company’s values and its general direction. The \[Insert Value\] really stands out to me because \[Insert Reason\]. I also recently read that \[Insert topical reason\] and this appeals to me because \[Why it appeals to you\].*

Realize that this part is your chance to bring out what you like about the company. And if you can’t really think of anything, maybe you need to rethink why you’re actually applying.

***(vi) Conclusion***

Simply state what you want and why you want it:

*I think you’ll find that my experience is a really good fit for \[COMPANY\] and specifically this position. I’m ready to take my skills to the next level with your team and look forward to hearing back.*

*Thanks,*

*Your name*

**Putting it together**

Combing everything, here’s what my cover letter for my current job looked like:

https://preview.redd.it/i4whem84zem81.png?width=4236&format=png&auto=webp&s=60072e121835415cbfa0f3706c91ad2faad5b1bf

And voila. You now have all the tools to write a killer cover letter.

1afgvv9,Friendly reminder not to work too hard. You'll just get fired,"The year just started and there are already over 50K layoffs. The latest one is UPS, including some data professionals at corporate. These are people who worked hard, built a career with the company over extremely long period of time, stayed loyal, 3% merit increases, worked extra hours because they believed that they were contributing to a better future for the company and themselves.... And they were laid off without a second thought for cost saving. Yeah, Because that makes so much sense, right? Record-breaking profits every year is an unattainable goal, and it's stupid that here in the USA, we are one of the only countries that keeps pushing for this while other countries are leaving us in the dust with their quality of life....

qph4tx,How to get a job in data science - a semi-harsh Q/A guide.,"**HOW DO I GET A JOB IN DATA SCIENCE?**

Hey you. Yes you, person asking ""how do I get a job in data science/analytics/MLE/AI whatever BS job with data in the title?"". I got news for you. There are two simple rules to getting one of these jobs.

1. Have experience.

2. Don't have no experience.

There are approximately 1000 entry level candidates who think they're qualified because they did a 24 week bootcamp for every entry level job. I don't need to be a statistician to tell you your odds of landing one of these aren't great.

**HOW DO I GET EXPERIENCE?**

Are you currently employed? If not, get a job. If you are, figure out a way to apply data science in your job, then put it on your resume. Mega bonus points here if you can figure out a way to attribute a dollar value to your contribution. Talk to your supervisor about career aspirations at year-end/mid-year reviews. Maybe you'll find a way to transfer to a role internally and skip the whole resume ignoring phase. Alternatively, network. Be friends with people who are in the roles you want to be in, maybe they'll help you find a job at their company.

**WHY AM I NOT GETTING INTERVIEWS?**

IDK. Maybe you don't have the required experience. Maybe there are 500+ other people applying for the same position. Maybe your resume stinks. If you're getting 1/20 response rate, you're doing great. Quit whining. 

**IS XYZ DEGREE GOOD FOR DATA SCIENCE?**

Does your degree involve some sort of non-remedial math higher than college algebra? Does your degree involve taking any sort of programming classes? If yes, congratulations, your degree will pass most base requirements for data science. Is it the best? Probably not, unless you're CS or some really heavy math degree where half your classes are taught in Greek letters. Don't come at me with those art history and underwater basket weaving degrees unless you have multiple years experience doing something else.

**SHOULD I DO XYZ BOOTCAMP/MICROMASTERS?**

Do you have experience? No? This ain't gonna help you as much as you think it might. Are you experienced and want to learn more about how data science works? This could be helpful.

**SHOULD I DO XYZ MASTER'S IN DATA SCIENCE PROGRAM?**

Congratulations, doing a Master's is usually a good idea and will help make you more competitive as a candidate. Should you shell out 100K for one when you can pay 10K for one online? Probably not. In all likelihood, you're not gonna get $90K in marginal benefit from the more expensive program. Pick a known school (probably avoid really obscure schools, the name does count for a little) and you'll be fine. Big bonus here if you can sucker your employer into paying for it.

**WILL XYZ CERTIFICATE HELP MY RESUME?**

Does your certificate say ""AWS"" or ""AZURE"" on it? If not, no.

**DO I NEED TO KNOW XYZ MATH TOPIC?**

Yes. Stop asking. Probably learn probability, be familiar with linear algebra, and understand what the hell a partial derivative is. Learn how to test hypotheses. Ultimately you need to know what the heck is going on math-wise in your predictions otherwise the company is going to go bankrupt and it will be all your fault. 

**WHAT IF I'M BAD AT MATH?**

Git gud. Do some studying or something. MIT opencourseware has a bunch of free recorded math classes. If you want to learn some Linear Algebra, Gilbert Strang is your guy. 

**WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES SHOULD I LEARN?**

STOP ASKING THIS QUESTION. I CAN GOOGLE ""HOW TO BE A DATA SCIENTIST"" AND EVERY SINGLE GARBAGE TDS ARTICLE WILL TELL YOU SQL AND PYTHON/R. YOU'RE LUCKY YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE JOY OF SEGMENTATION FAULTS TO RUN A SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION. 

**SHOULD I LEARN PYTHON OR R?**

Both. Python is more widely used and tends to be more general purpose than R. R is better at statistics and data analysis, but is a bit more niche. 
Take your pick to start, but ultimately you're gonna want to learn both you slacker.

**SHOULD I MAKE A PORTFOLIO?**

Yes. And don't put some BS housing price regression, iris classification, or titanic survival project on it either. Next question.

**WHAT SHOULD I DO AS A PROJECT?**

IDK what are you interested in? If you say twitter sentiment stock market prediction go sit in the corner and think about what you just said. Every half brained first year student who can pip install sklearn and do model.fit() has tried unsuccessfully to predict the stock market. The efficient market hypothesis is a thing for a reason. There are literally millions of other free datasets out there you have one of the most powerful search engines at your fingertips to go find them. Pick something you're interested in, find some data, and analyze it. 

**DO I NEED TO BE GOOD WITH PEOPLE?** (courtesy of /u/bikeskata)

Yes! First, when you're applying, no one wants to work with a weirdo. You should be able to have a basic conversation with people, and they shouldn't come away from it thinking you'll follow them home and wear their skin as a suit. Once you get a job, you'll be interacting with colleagues, and you'll need them to care about your analysis. Presumably, there are non-technical people making decisions you'll need to bring in as well. If you can't explain to a moderately intelligent person why they should care about the thing that took you 3 days (and cost $$$ in cloud computing costs), you probably won't have your position for long. You don't need to be the life of the party, but you should be pleasant to be around.


**WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS?**

xbl58o,Here are the questions I was asked for my entry level DS job!,"Hey everyone. I posted a thread a few days ago about being nervous about my first DS interview. The thread was taken down by mods due to it being more appropriate for the stickied thread. So I want to make this thread less about questions, but more of an informative post to show you some of the questions I was asked. Hopefully it's helpful for newbies and veterans alike!

&#x200B;

**SQL:**

* What is a view?
* Is a table dynamic or static?
* Difference between a primary key and foreign key
* Inner Join vs. Left Join scenario (pretty sure it was from w3schools. ez pz)
* WHERE vs. HAVING
* When would you use a subquery? Provide an example
* How would you improve the performance of a slow query?
* EDIT: Some aggregation and GROUP by questions (MAX, AVG, COUNT, etc.) that I just remembered.

**Python**

* Explanation of libraries I use (Pandas mainly)
* How would you get the maximum result from a list?
* Can you explain the concept of functions
* Difference between FOR and WHILE loops?
* Give some examples of how you would clean dirty data.

**Tableau:**

* What is a calculated field? Provide some examples in your work
* What is the difference between a live view and extract? When would you use each?
* More information given on the data I work with

**Statistics:**

* Explain what a p-value is to someone who has no idea what that is.
* Explanation on linear/logistic regression modeling.
* What is standard deviation? Examples?
* Difference between STDEV and Variance?
* What statistics do you currently work with? (Descriptive mainly... mean, median, mode, stdev, confidence intervals)

I advanced to round 3 immediately, which is pretty much a shoe-in according to the hiring manager. I am very excited because it seems like a great opportunity. Even if I don't get it, I still felt like I interviewed very well and did my best. I am very proud of myself.

120k a year w/ benefits, bonuses, and training courses a week to help me learn more advanced DS concepts, Python, or whatever I want.

Hi,

My girlfriend is a 22 year old university student passionate about data science, and she just posted my first article on Medium using Machine-Learning (that took her months of research and coding to put together). Her post only has about 500 views, but to her surprise today a reddit user called [**Dean-Hoffman**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dean-Hoffman/) **posted a link to his own data science company where he copy-pasted her article.** He didn't contact her about reposting it, didn't give her proper credit and **ridiculously added a ""Contact Data Scientist"" at the end with his name on it**. On the article, he clearly stated he is the author in multiple locations. This is the ""Data Science"" company that links from the article on his website: [https://www.actionablelabs.com/](https://www.actionablelabs.com/)

Apparently the guy Dean Hoffman is the ""founder"" of the company and refers to himself on the About Us as **""offering the highest commitment to excellence, personal integrity, and business ethics.""**

Update: Hey, this is the girlfriend that wrote the article. First of all, thank you all that made the time to reply, research and help me find answers. It's really appreciated.  So far, this is what we know about this person (or people):

\- This website has been stealing hundreds, if not thousands, of data science projects and articles from legitimate data scientists and writers.

\- The stolen content website in definitely bot-operated as the owner posts dozens of articles a day, completely copy+paste, mainly from Medium, TechCrunch and Towards Data Science.

\- It's confirmed that Dean-Hoffman from the Linkedin that links from his company (Actionable Labs) is a real person and the same Dean-Hoffman that is stealing content and running a data company.

\- If you go on his linkedin, under ""Data Scientist - Pennsylvania Department of General Services"" you will find that he mentions ""Actionable Insights"" (the stolen content website) in one of his experiences. Completely absurd.

UPDATE 2: Medium and TDS unfortunately can't do much for me individually as the authors are the ones who own the rights to the articles. TDS will try to reach out to the owner and ask them to take the posts down. I hope they see that their whole website is being copied, which would most likely infringe their TOS.

Please don't comment anything that contains the words ""copyright"", ""infringement"" or related words on her article as it may trigger keyword algorithms that delete copyrighted articles posted to Medium (and thus could have her article deleted). Thank you!

qdai89,"I just explained recall/precision to a non-DS, and he got it immediately","Explain it like fishing with a net. You use a wide net, and catch 80 of 100 total fish in a lake. That's 80% recall. But you also get 80 rocks in your net. That means 50% precision, half of the net's contents is junk. You could use a smaller net and target one pocket of the lake where there are lots of fish and no rocks, but you might only get 20 of the fish in order to get 0 rocks. That is 20% recall and 100% precision.

p7hpd9,"The Key Word in Data Science is Science, not Data","I know reddit doesn't represent real life, but just look at the titles of this sub. They're all about tools, code languages/packages, and algorithms. I think to most aspiring data scientists, that's how they see the profession. You're given a tech stack, some data, and your goal is to apply x tool/algorithm to y data. My argument is this is only going to work at super junior levels, and I believe it's the reason why there's a huge oversupply of junior data scientists but teams still can't find competent seniors.  


As another experiment, just head over to r/dataisbeautiful right now. You'll see a ton of different techs used to generate some decent and some awful visualizations. All of those people were able to access, clean, and plot data. There's no shortage of people who can do that. But what you'll notice if you read that sub, is there's a huge lack of people thinking critically about the data they're working with, and that's the science aspect.

&#x200B;

I feel like every week there's a new topic here on how long until data scientists are obsolete. I don't think data scientists are getting less valuable, but people who can just use tool x to leverage data y are. Why would I hire a senior data scientist to create a dashboard when I can teach an intern tableau and get 95% of the same thing? Whether it's recognizing Simpson's paradox, knowing when to keep/stop digging into research questions, figuring out when gathering more data is necessary, knowing how to communicate findings in ways that make an impact, the science part of data science is by far the most valuable. Some people call them soft skills, but I'm not a huge fan of the term. It's science. Unfortunately these are the toughest skills to learn and also the toughest skills to interview for, so I don't suspect you'll see companies steering away from technical questions in interviews any time soon. But mastering the science aspect of data science is I believe the best way to make yourself extremely valuable.",1303,155,None,2021-08-19 16:01:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/p7hpd9/the_key_word_in_data_science_is_science_not_data/,0,datascience

o468ms,"Hi! I just expanded the Data Science Cheatsheet to five pages, added material on Time Series, Statistics, and A/B Testing, and landed my first full-time job","Hey all! You might remember me from the Data Science Cheatsheet I posted a few months ago ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ljftgi/i_created_a_fourpage_data_science_cheatsheet_to/)). The support from that was incredible, and I thought I’d share an update.

Since then, I’ve gone through a dozen interviews, ranging from FANG to startups to MBB, and updated the cheatsheet with topics I’ve seen covered in actual interviews.

Improvements include:

* Added Time Series
* Added Statistics
* Added A/B Testing
* Improved Distribution Section
* Added Multi-class SVM
* Added HMM
* Miscellaneous Section
* And a bunch of other small changes scattered throughout!

These topics, along with the material covered previously, are all condensed in a convenient five-page Data Science Cheatsheet, found [here](https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet).

I’ll be heading to a FANG company as a DS after graduation, and I hope this cheatsheet is helpful to those on the job hunt or just looking to brush up on machine learning concepts. Feel free to leave any suggestions and star/save the repo for reference and future updates!

13ilm03,I investigated the Underground Economy of Glassdoor Reviews,"Online company reviews are high stakes.

Top reviews on sites like Glassdoor and Google can get thousands of impressions each month and are major drivers of brand perception.

Employers know this. And when I come across multiple 5 star reviews left with no cons, or a Pulitzer worthy essay from a former intern, I become suspicious.

These reviews start to resemble 30 under 30 lists: so artificially constructed that you begin to question their credibility in the first place.

The scrutiny around company reviews is well documented; some companies file lawsuits worth over a million dollars to reveal anonymous reviewers that complain about their jobs.

Whilst it's the flashy lawsuits that make the headlines, there also exists an underground economy of company reviews operating quietly every single day.

In this underground economy, some companies pay over $150 to freelancers to try and get a negative review removed. If they want “better” results, they go to the plethora of Online Reputation Management services (ORMs) in the United States that can charge retainers worth thousands of dollars.

The supply of positive reviews exists too. My research led me to find companies, including a prominent Y-Combinator backed startup, that solicit fake positive reviews from online freelancers to improve their rating.

Many of these mercenary fake reviewers, often based in South East Asia, make a full time living doing this, netting over $2,000 per month.

Some of these run such sophisticated operations that they’ve even created their own pricing tiers (e.g $35 per original review, $20 to post an already created review from an email address), a la SaaS offering.

Others operate on a contingency fee agreement model, where they only get paid if they’re able to take a negative review down.

The underground economy of company reviews is well and truly alive. And today we’re going to find out how it operates.

***Note***: For more content like this, [*subscribe*](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe) *to my newsletter. In a couple of weeks, I'll be releasing my guide to writing a killer resume.*

**Adding reviews**

The barriers to entry for adding fake reviews are much lower than for getting reviews removed, so that’s where we’ll start.

To write an employer review, all you really need is the ability to create an email address. For most sites, you don’t need any proof of employment (say like a company specific email address).

I went on a gig marketplace site and posted a pretty vague post related to wanting to find out more on how to improve a company’s online presence.

Within minutes of posting a gig, my inbox was flooded with proposals:

https://preview.redd.it/esx3904qa20b1.png?width=3064&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff3a2f8528fee99aabb830f27ea71a7569ebb2e

After a bit of chatting, I narrowed the scope of their services and summarized their rates into the table below:

|Channel|Cost|Timeline|Model|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Freelancer #1|$10 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #2|$35 per original review, $20 per already created review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #3|$25 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #4|$25 per review|Monthly|10 reviews|
|Freelancer #5|$20 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Online Reputation Management Agency|$300 subscription|Monthly|8 reviews|

Let’s dive a bit deeper into the services that Freelancer #5 offered.

Freelancer #5 explained to me he had been writing reviews for one particular company for the past 4 months now. Each month he wrote them 10 reviews.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n1ddox6cb20b1.png?width=2684&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c271d0eec4328cb78d7d2cb85dfffa3f9eb72f8

In another message, he tells me he’s offering the same services to 5 other companies. Doing some quick math:

5 companies x 10 reviews per company x $25 per review = $1,250 per month

Considering the average person in Pakistan earns $150 per month, that’s not bad change at all.

One of the companies that he’s offering his services to includes a Y-Combinator backed startup. I won’t name the company, but here’s what its average Glassdoor review rating distribution looks like:

https://preview.redd.it/2np5b6fdb20b1.png?width=2420&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8cafaa85453b0933a18eb5c30f931b3bb893c46

5 star reviews account for over 77% of the company’s total reviews. Obviously, no one is buying fake reviews that make them look bad.

But here’s the thing: freelancers are getting quite smart when it comes to writing reviews that don’t look too fishy. They tend to do this by spacing the reviews out (so that they don’t come in “spikes” – more on this later) and they also make sure that they’re not always leaving the “cons” section blank.

Don’t get me wrong, if you come across this company’s reviews, it’d be pretty easy to tell they’re quite strange. In fact, I can’t even post some screenshots here because it’d give the company away immediately.

But it would be challenging to conclude that the above company is buying reviews just by analyzing review volume and distribution without actually reading some of the reviews.

The same company is also buying reviews on Google Reviews.

Sidenote: I got curious about how he’s been writing 50 reviews from 50 different emails per month. Would he actually create 50 different email addresses? And what about the IP address – doesn’t Glassdoor flag multiple reviews from the same IP?

One of the freelancers answered my question:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g4id2yqeb20b1.png?width=2572&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2a77fdea8834a6d90f02b8b3eb67b3a874f3df2

Moving on – another company that seems to buy fake reviews seems to be having some more trouble. Approximately a month after a freelancer linked me to fake reviews he had written for this company, all five reviews that he had linked me to had been removed:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/99fdvcgfb20b1.png?width=3116&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7e244529fc62b5c824d925feb61fd2cc16cbfd5

Based on this [Glassdoor webinar](https://youtu.be/3iy0JWOS1gs) from 2018, “if it is found that a user has created multiple email accounts to submit reviews, then ALL submissions from that user are deleted” – so likely Glassdoor’s content moderation team flagged one of the initial reviews and the same freelancer who was writing reviews for that company had all the fake reviews deleted.

So far, it looks like the key to an effective fake review creation strategy lies in:

* Spacing the fake reviews out
* Writing each review from a different IP address (i.e benefit of being part of a team)
* Using language that isn’t an obvious giveaway

On that third point: the reality is that many of these freelancers’ first language is not English.

As an experiment, I turned to everybody’s favorite new toy, ChatGPT, and asked it to write me a positive Glassdoor review:

https://preview.redd.it/8w7cal9gb20b1.png?width=3164&format=png&auto=webp&s=860c39b11c5813e8b7fabdbb038d73c565cc98cf

And I’d say that the above answer was better than 95% of the fake reviews I came across.

**Removing reviews**

The process for removing an employer review usually works like this:

1. You identify one or multiple reviews that you want removed
2. You verify whether the review violates the site's Guidelines, or whether there’s something else about the review(s) that could get it removed.
3. You file an appeal to get it removed.

As an example, Glassdoor’s Review guidelines can be found [here](https://help.glassdoor.com/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US#:~:text=See%20More-,Review%C2%A0Guidelines,-Millions%20of%20job). Mainly, they forbid mentioning anyone by name who’s not an executive and revealing proprietary or confidential information, amongst a host of other things.

Sounds simple enough right? Well, according to one of the freelancers I messaged:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x6s8hsyac20b1.png?width=2036&format=png&auto=webp&s=f86c386f864198dc43faeb41faea378090c20107

After some research, I summarized the different vendors and prices in the table below:

&#x200B;

|Channel|Cost|Timeline|Model|Self reported success rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Freelancer #1|$100 per review|3 days|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Freelancer #2|$30 per review|7 days|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Reputation management service #2|$450 per review|21 business days|Contingency Agreement Model|Unknown|
|Reputation management service #3|$1000 per review|Undefined|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Reputation management service #4 Plan 1|$550 per review|5-6 weeks|Contingency Agreement Model|50-75%|
|Reputation management service #4 Plan 2|$300 Subscription + $100 per each review removed|Monthly service|Subscription plan|50-75%|
|Freelancer #3|$20|Undefined|Pay regardless|Undefined|
|Freelancer #4|$500|Undefined|Contingency Agreement Model|Undefined|

As you can see, unlike the fake review generation market, the prices vary quite a bit for getting reviews removed.

At one end, you have freelancers on gig marketplaces that will attempt to remove a review for less than $100. And then on the other end, you have ORMs (Online Reputation Management Agencies) that have multiple employees and more comprehensive packages in place. The one constant seems to be that most companies operate on a contingency agreement model (i.e pay only if review gets removed).

**Analyzing reviews**

ReviewMeta is a site that analyzes Amazon reviews and tells you how many are legitimate. The creator of the site, Tommy Noonan, mentions in an [interview with NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/06/27/623990036/episode-850-the-fake-review-hunter) that the main giveaway that a product is soliciting fake reviews is:

* A large, suspicious flood of positive reviews at the exact same time. For example, a 3 day stretch of time constituting 30% of total reviews.
* Phrases and words that are constantly repeated, especially in the section with no cons
* Brand monogamists (only review products from one company)

Whilst the last two bullets are hard to track, the first can be used to analyze different companies’ reviews and to check if there might be some funky business going on.

After a couple of days, I have the ability to track review volume and review ratings over time for any company that I specify:

https://preview.redd.it/ehcbw2oje20b1.png?width=1653&format=png&auto=webp&s=b448ff35eb9878fbb1686de2fa8cf031e4ed3e05

Let the games begin.

## Voluntary Response Bias

One of the biggest challenges that review platforms face is the Voluntary Response bias.

Research shows many of today’s most popular online review platforms (e.g Amazon) have a distribution of opinion that is highly polarized, with many extreme positive and/or negative reviews, and few moderate opinions.

Think about it: have you ever felt moderately satisfied at your job and thought to yourself, now would be a great time to leave a Glassdoor review? Probably not.

On the other hand, if you’ve had a terrible experience or even just had one thing really flip you off, you might be quite likely to leave an angry review.

Consider when a company goes through layoffs. You’re going to have a flood of angry reviews coming your way and are likely going to experience a “spike” in reviews.

**Note:** Just like the Wall Street Journal’s methodology described [here](https://archive.is/20201016094732/https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977#selection-3965.0-3968.0), I considered there to be a spike if the total number of reviews in the month was greater than three standard deviations above the mean of the surrounding months.

Let’s take the company below. Here’s a graph of of their review volume since Jan 2020, including when they announced one of their first round of layoffs in June 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/n6kd9ejle20b1.png?width=3216&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eea2f3836617feca37eb88b1d3f67c8fa1b6fe2

In June 2022, approximately 19% of this company's 52 reviews were 1 star reviews (compared to an overall average of around 10%). This is what we could call a statistically significant spike in reviews. It also illustrates how the employees most likely to leave reviews are the ones that obviously had a bad experience (i.e getting laid off).

Here’s another company that had a similar spike in negative reviews due to layoffs in November 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/4vcnr1ine20b1.png?width=2408&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3877fb315ccc5d9a9294306a9f86616cb0fabd2

This company had an approximate 20% 1 star review rate (compared to an overall average of 12%) in November 2022, as well as an Avg Rating of 2.96 that month (compared to an overall average rating of 3.73).Unless HR is proactive, their reviews page risks succumbing to an echochamber of negative reviews that can really tilt one way.

**Note:** Glassdoor does state (based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iy0JWOS1gs) from 2017) that about 75% of the reviews on their platform are neutral. Their “give to get policy” has helped in keeping the platform from becoming too polarized.

I can understand why HR teams, like the ones that Nader talked to me about earlier, take a proactive stance towards managing their reviews. If they don’t try to control their reputation themselves, then their reputation risks getting controlled by the employees that had the worst possible experience.

## Goodhart’s Law

Goodhart’s law states the following:

*""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure""*

Every October, Glassdoor publishes their Best Places To Work ranking.

In a [report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977) that the WSJ did a couple of years ago, they found large spikes in the number of reviews that some companies (e.g SpaceX, Bain & Co, etc) got in September. The logic here is that some companies try to artificially inflate their Glassdoor reviews right before the October deadline.

I decided to revisit some of this analysis with Glassdoor’s 2023 Best Places To Work Ranking.

One of the companies I examined is rated as one of the best places to work in 2023. Let’s refer to this company as FunPlaceToWork.

Here is how their review volume looks like for all of 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/4e656zkqe20b1.png?width=2516&format=png&auto=webp&s=07141a66c56be7a6818efb9b1a4d912ee0021c91

FunPlaceToWork got around 50 reviews in September 2022. Of those 50 reviews, 96% were 5 star reviews.

FunPlaceToWork averaged 12 reviews per month up till then in 2022. Also, in the prior six months, the average percent of 5 star reviews received every month was \~75%.

Both the spike in volume of reviews and the spike in percentage of five star reviews are statistically significant.

I find it strange that Glassdoor’s proprietary algorithm and/or Human Content Moderation team did not find a spike of this nature unusual. If we look at Glassdoor’s eligibility criteria for the award, it’s as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/hag04y7se20b1.png?width=2868&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec2b920e126a8ea42b40d35aaa55d5341e69d022

The goal, according to Glassdoor, is to collect “authentic and unbiased reviews”.

Whilst there’s nothing against the rules for asking your employees to leave you reviews, I find the statistically significant spike of reviews at odds with the goal of collecting ""unbiased and authentic"" reviews (which Glassdoor states is the purpose of the awards).

Glassdoor states that an employer is allowed to ask its employees to leave reviews, but that they are not allowed to “coerce” them. Examples of what you can’t do:

* Offer incentives like Gift Cards in exchange for positive reviews.
* Withholding their reference letter unless they leave you a positive review.
* Anything that leads you to require proof for the employee to show you that they wrote a review.

It is possible to play by the rules (i.e not break any of the above rules) and to still in my opinion not collect authentic and unbiased reviews.

They say that you shouldn’t hate the player but the game – I think **FunPlaceToWork** played by the rules, won fair and square, and that this is simply a perfect example of Goodhart’s Law.

I reached out to Glassdoor ([awards@glassdoor.com](mailto:awards@glassdoor.com)) about the above and this is the reply I got:

https://preview.redd.it/x0dqq39ue20b1.png?width=4800&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0102c963be9486370b340f2f473cbc6650fc48a

**Conclusion**

When I was 22, on an [F1 visa with 3 months to find work](https://www.careerfair.io/job-hunt-story), I didn’t give a damn about bad reviews. I needed a job and I’d sign any piece of paper you put in front of me.

Compare that to someone at the peak of their career, someone with optionality and a multitude of job offers; an “A-Player”, as the experts call it, would absolutely have the luxury of choice and discard a job offer based on bad company reviews.

For most people, the impact of online company reviews lies somewhere in the middle. In marketing, there’s a concept of a “marketing touchpoint” - an interaction with the brand over the course of the whole buying journey.

Company reviews are one of the many touchpoints a job seeker experiences over their interview process. And with the technology industry booming the past couple of years, companies couldn’t afford to slack on any touchpoints, including this one.

After all, when others start to game the system, you’re at a disadvantage if you don’t. The rewards can be quite high. Certainly higher than just trying to be as transparent as possible.

HR leaders are often more incentivized to inflate their metrics than to get honest feedback. Fake review writers have bills to pay. ORMs know that companies are desperate. And the platforms, well, aren’t always paying attention.

The result is a potluck of interests that leads to an underground economy.

One that ends up hurting the job seeker.

nue01q,"Data Science and Data Analytics is becoming ultra glorified / romanticized, and I don't think people are really told what they are getting into.","I honestly, don't think people wanting to break into Data Science really know what all it entails. It just sounds good, and sounds like it will make them lots of money.

No one tells people what comes with the job. There are a lot of headaches that come with it, and you have to be a very patient person.

When any person starts out in IT, they learn some psychology. How to manage users and their expectations. You learn what to say and what not to say. You learn how to appear confident and reassuring even if you're getting up to speed in the moment. The good ones do anyway.

Data Science, BI, DA - you have to have those skills multiplied by ten. You have to be better than the rest at managing expectations. You have to learn how to avoid support drains, and be thinking ahead all of the time.

The data science people are the only people I respect as much as the people in Systems. Because other fields, you learn one thing and only one side of it, call yourself an engineer despite knowing one side. Sys Engineers have to know a little about everything and base knowledge in all kinds of things/ They are constantly growing. Data Science folks are similar because they have to know a wide assortment of things, and they have to know all of the tips and tricks at their disposal to get their desired result. Which means they will know Python, multiple types of SQL, Pandas, Jupyter, and so on. They'll pivot in Excel in a pinch if they need to.

But the main reason I respect them is just because of how patient they have to be to want to work in their field for 30+ years.

Our DA left in 2018 and one of my roles was a senior DBA, so they just put her job on top of mine. I learned a lot and I got very good at SQL and streamlining and reducing task turn around for reports and data tasks. But I obviously didn't have the time to dive ultra deep into the rabbit hole, and I didn't want to. Because I knew it wasn't for me.

We were acquired, and I transitioned all of that stuff onto the BI team of the new company. I have so much respect for those people. I am still answering questions and taking one off requests. This morning I was just hit in the face with how much I dislike actually doing he DS/DA side. A Sales Senior Manager needed something with some data. I asked a follow up question. I needed a key piece of info to ensure I did the right thing and didn't have to do re work later. They said they would get it to me later.

They emailed it to me at 7:11am this morning, then messaged me before my shift - ""Hey, I don't see the data task with the blah blah being done. We needed it 6/3."" And I am thinking - then why wait until 6/7 to give me the info. We got the request 6/4, and I asked you on 6/4, then you waited the weekend to get it to me.

And those individuals who just keep coming back telling you the data wasn't what they expected or wanted when it is what they asked for.. I'm so happy to be just a senior sys engineer again working on large scale infra.

It's not for everyone, and I think they need to talk about and teach managing expectations so you don't shoot yourself in the foot. Luckily the BI team of the new company are phenomenal, and now I am out of the game. 

But I am learning more Python at home in my spare time and things like Jupyter so I don't regress skill wise. Python is useful in what I do anyway. I've rewritten several PS automation scripts in it.",1069,189,None,2021-06-07 14:33:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/nue01q/data_science_and_data_analytics_is_becoming_ultra/,0,datascience

fm17ja,"To All ""Data Scientists"" out there, Crowdsourcing COVID-19","Recently there's massive influx of ""teams of data scientists"" looking to crowd source ideas for doing an analysis related task regarding the SARS-COV 2 or COVID-19.

I ask of you, please take into consideration data science is only useful for exploratory analysis at this point. Please take into account that current common tools in ""data science"" are ""bias reinforcers"", not great to predict on fat and long tailed distributions. The algorithms are not objective and there's epidemiologists, virologists (read data scientists) who can do a better job at this than you. Statistical analysis will eat machine learning in this task. Don't pretend to use AI, it won't work.

Don't pretend to crowd source over kaggle, your data is old and stale the moment it comes out unless the outbreak has fully ended for a month in your data. If you have a skill you also need the expertise of people IN THE FIELD OF HEALTHCARE. If your best work is overfitting some algorithm to be a kaggle ""grand master"" then please seriously consider studying decision making under risk and uncertainty and refrain from giving advice.

Machine learning is label (or bias) based, take into account that the labels could be wrong that the cleaning operations are wrong. If you really want to help, look to see if there's teams of doctors or healthcare professionals who need help. Don't create a team of non-subject-matter-expert ""data scientists"". Have people who understand biology.

I know people see this as an opportunity to become famous and build a portfolio and some others see it as an opportunity to help. If you're the type that wants to be famous, trust me you won't. You can't bring a knife (logistic regression) to a tank fight.",992,160,hypothesenulle,2020-03-20 19:36:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fm17ja/to_all_data_scientists_out_there_crowdsourcing/,1,datascience
1avoc19,Linear Regression is underrated,"Hey folks,

Wanted to share a quick story from the trenches of data science. I am not a data scientist but engineer however I've been working on a dynamic pricing project where the client was all in on neural networks to predict product sales and figure out the best prices using overly complicated setup. They tried linear regression once, didn't work magic instantly, so they jumped ship to the neural network, which took them days to train.

I thought, ""Hold on, let's not ditch linear regression just yet."" Gave it another go, dove a bit deeper, and bam - it worked wonders. Not only did it spit out results in seconds (compared to the days of training the neural networks took), but it also gave us clear insights on how different factors were affecting sales. Something the neural network's complexity just couldn't offer as plainly.

Moral of the story? Sometimes the simplest tools are the best for the job. Linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees might seem too basic next to flashy neural networks, but it's quick, effective, and gets straight to the point. Plus, you don't need to wait days to see if you're on the right track.

So, before you go all in on the latest and greatest tech, don't forget to give the classics a shot. Sometimes, they're all you need.

Cheers!

lkn4rl,Please STOP asking Data Scientists about Leetcode questions meant for Software Engineers for job interviews,"I've been working as a Data Scientist long enough to say that asking Leetcode questions for Data Scientists is completely disrespectful. This is both for both product and ML-based data scientists.

Something simple is fine, like hashmaps, two pointers, strings, some light algorithms etc. But graph theories, DFS with trees/dynamic programming has nothing to do with data analytics, ML fundamentals, statistical foundations, and data storytelling competence.

I really don't understand. When you have a wealth of ways to distinguish competent Data Scientists from juniors during interview pipeline (complicated SQL, pandas, data munging, visualization, ML training, building simulation code, etc.), why you'd rather choose questions like ""how many moves do you need to get a Queen chess piece from this position to another on a chessboard"" as a way of measuring how well a Data Scientist would perform analytics or ML training on the job. It really just feels like SWEs making fun of Data Scientists about how poor programmers we are.

Most companies don't pull crap like this, but for those who do, PLEASE STOP. Unless we received a BA or MA in computer science -- which majority if not most of us did not -- we won't be able to solve shit like this unless we cheat and look at answers directly on leetcode or geekforgeeks. And it's infuriating and embarrassing for us to sink to this kind of level to solve questions that aren't meant for us. I get that Data people need to know programming, but WE AREN'T SWEs, and DS is not SWE.

**Edit**: I'm getting a lot of replies saying that I suck at programming and I need to learn SWE fundamentals. I said over and over that I'm not against understanding foundations of SWE (hashmaps, runtime, pointers, optimized solutions vs brute force). These are important. But when you get into highly niched algorithm named after somebody where you need to do some complicated tricks or build a whole system that requires multiple functions, DFS-based dynamic programming, multiple inheritance methods all in 45 minutes that would unnerve even seasoned SWEs out of practice, that's when it becomes totally unreasonable, outside the realm of data science, and just disrespectful to what Data Scientists do on a daily basis. But that's the line I draw, and the overall question is: at what point do interview questions become unjustifiable and unrelated to the position at hand? I've spent years using pandas, scikit-learn, tableau, and complicated SQL for daily data tasks. Why is it that you can't test me on this stuff which occurs on day-to-day basis for majority of data scientists?

**Edit Edit:** Btw, shame on those of you just downvoting everything I'm saying without reading any of it (I can't even locate my own comments anymore). It's immature and completely ridiculous.

But for the love of fucking god... I am so sick of being thrown responsibility or projects because good ol mary in sales watched a video on “gesture recognition”. The ideas are a great, and I have a framework for filtering them, but the fucking pressure, the initiation of projects with 0 data, no aim at data collection, no quality assurance or risk management and the icing on the cake, “we should roll out an MVP in 2 months”. What in gods name is that shit? 

I’m the asshole. I’m always the asshole.

k7iytr,Landing a Senior Data Scientist Job After 6 Months of Unemployment,"I graduated this year with a masters of statistics. In this article, I will explain the process that ultimately led to my offer for a **Senior Data Scientist ** position for a company in the SF Bay Area. The components of the process that led to my success, in no particular order, were: crafting my resume and LinkedIn, building skills and projects, staying motivated (during the pandemic), decoding the data science interview process, and determining my professional goals.

(**EDIT // Important Note: this is not big N or FAANG, since in the comments people are using top top companies to benchmark my experience**)

## Preface 

As with any statistical inference, a singleton dataset won't yield robustness. I was an unusual applicant to my grad program, and am an unorthodox candidate for DS roles, which is why it took me six months to find a job while my peers all had several offers immediately following graduation (and some months in advance!). I worked for 6 years between my undergrad and masters in the nonprofit world and had many different job titles, as noted in Edit #2 below. Coming back to school was a huge pivot and career shift, and so I am extremely fortunate to have found a firm who recognized the unique strengths I bring to the table; I was also extremely fortunate to interact with this firm at the right time where my unique strength combination was part of their strategic plan. 

**Takeaway:** My experience is not a modal experience, but the tools I used and the lessons I learned may be useful for others. I would have appreciated reading it two years ago, so I'm putting it here in case others relate. Also a friendly reminders to aspiring or current data scientists not to conflate [prior and posterior probabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/posterior-probability.asp).

## Crafting My Resume and LinkedIn

I completely botched my first DS resume. I borrowed a classmate's resume and used it as a template, and tried to copy what they had done. But they had internships, relevant projects, and a better GPA than me, so my version looked... weird, since I didn't have any of those things. Also, I was still expecting people to ""read between the lines"" on my resume instead of being as clear as possible. I started applying and connecting with folks, and what I am shocked by is that **not one person I asked about my resume gave substantial or useful feedback**. The one useful piece of feedback that I received was from my parents, who remarked ""this doesn't seem to really sell you; you're much better in person than on this paper."" While initially, I was resistant to rehauling my resume, I decided to spend a full week almost full time rehauling my resume. This paid off, because I saw a significant uptick in responses and was able to get several first round interviews. The main changes I made:

- Only put what is relevant to the role you are applying for. Even though I had some impressive accomplishments from other projects or roles, I chose the projects or skills that were relevant to data science. 
- Similar to the [first rule of road-side beet sales](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/19/3d/b6/193db68d6c65ce5881edcbd84c1e436c.jpg), I put my best features in the top half of my resume. 
- I used Canva to make a visually appealing resume, and later switched to a LaTeX resume template to make my resume more professional looking. This was a very very good decision, and I got so much positive feedback from recruiters and hiring managers after making that change. 
- I used a LaTeX cover letter template to write cover letters, which made it look very official and professional. It was easier to produce because I could just make a new document in overleaf and change small portions in the letter, since it's mostly common across applications, and once you do enough you have even domain specific and role specific letters ready to go.

**Takeaway:** your image matters a lot. Make sure to craft it carefully, and tailor it for roles that you are really interested in. 

## Building Skills and Projects

My strategy for learning something is spend at least a week or two finding the best resource, then pay whatever it costs (in your budget) and use it 100%. Don't find 16 free cheat sheets and ""shortcuts"". I researched every resource I could find (many thanks to r/datascience, r/machinelearning, and r/cscareersquestions) and I tried out a few, but saw that many only give free temporary access to some subsection of the entire platform, so you can't really explore past the first few questions or modules. However, I saw a reddit post talking about some site called [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/) where they gave you 7 days for free, but it was full access. I looked through the catalogue and found a lot of what I wanted to learn. I took a week and devoted 8 hours per day to going through the modules. There are some things I would change, but for the most part, it is very well designed, and extremely helpful. I earned somewhere around 20K ""experience"" on the platform, which means I finished \~100-200 exercises from data engineering, modeling, or reviewing OOP in Python. Then at the end of the free trial, they emailed me a 62% coupon for a year's subscription, which brought it down to an insanely reasonable number, like between 100-150 bucks? Easy decision, since I had already mapped my curriculum through the rest of their materials, and they have new courses coming out every 1-2 weeks. 

For textbooks, anything from O'Reily with an animal on the front is probably going to be a good resource. I burned through about a half dozen of those books, taking notes and building the example projects, then moving to DataCamp to do similar projects, then once I felt confident, I would find a dataset from Kaggle or the UCI ML repo and try to carry out the steps, then benchmark my findings with some medium article where someone did the same thing. **Try to keep projects at the center of your learning, then find materials that will add to the project.** This is much more transferrable to a job, and learning to think in this way will help you in interviews. 

I saw an instagram account I follow put out a survey and was getting a lot of responses, but the way they were reporting the data was not able to do full justice to the story they were trying to tell. So I reached out and asked if I could take a look, and they were super excited to have someone with experience weigh in. So I ended up getting a few different spreadsheets, some with categorical and quantitative data and some categorical, while one of the responses was meant for a massively long response (Some users inputted over 1000 words). Do you see where this is going? It's basically a playground where my boss has 0 expectations and all I have to do is improve on autogenerated excel charts. I began cleaning the data in a notebook, then built a set of scripts, then loaded a database, then made a dashboard for the team (using a python flask app), and scheduled cron jobs to extract the data and report results to the ceo/founder of this nonprofit. Every new DataCamp module I completed was one more secret to the puzzle of how to present and improve the data visuals, process, and my code. I got invited to meetings with the other leaders, asked about business decisions, and got to be part of the real life cycle of their mission. 

Now that I had a taste of what that looked like, I reached out to my gym; they keep all of their members data on lifting progress and workout goals in an app, and I was able to give them a fun graphic and report for their members, and they shared on social media and saw an uptick in new memberships! I considered packaging this ""product"" and emailing other gyms, but I got overwhelmed by the pandemic/election and decided to put extra stuff on the back burner and wait for later when I have more skills. 

**Takeaway:** make your learning project driven, and document your entire project, including packaging in several different formats, making a clear write-up, and versions of a verbal explanation that take 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 20 minutes. Then, explain it for a PhD, a CEO, a peer, and a non-technical client (or whatever audiences you want, provided they vary by technical understanding and business investment). Try to carry every project through the finish line. As an example, this post/article is my way of compiling a high-level overview of the job search process--the ""finish line"" of this 6 month project.


## Decoding the Data Science Interview Process

Have you ever been invited to church by your friend, but they didn't explain anything before you got there? You don't know when to raise your hands, or to stand up or sit down, or why the man up front is yelling? That's how I felt for the last 6 months. From when you're supposed to negotiate salary, wtf a ""first year cliff"" is, or what you're allowed to ask and to whom, nobody teaches you this stuff. Why does everything have to be so goddamned awkward and needlessly confusing? I have teaching experience so all of this infuriated me as a very eager learner. 

There are two kinds of people you will encounter: 
- Those who pretend to know the answer, and give you bullshit advice or project onto your experience
- Those who know the answer, but don't know how to explain it, or give equally useless advice like ""just keep applying"". 

Nobody will tell you the truth to your face, or give you meaningful feedback of any kind, and I asked for it *constantly*. They will send you a form email, ghost you, or dodge your questions and judge you for breaking  etiquette **you have no idea about**. 

### My Process

I decided to submit some applications on Linkedin every other day as a benchmark, and took advantage of the ""Easy Apply"" feature to get more applications out. There is a tradeoff between quality and quantity in the applications you send out. Aside from more applications going out, I needed more information, so I decided to use my network to do some decoding.

I went on Facebook, IG, and my LinkedIn and filtered by software, data, CS, analyst etc until I had a list of people to ask questions to. I contacted each of them and asked for a brief phone call to get their advice and to hear about their experience in role R at company C. Here are examples of the questions I asked:

- What are your career goals and how have they changed?
- What are some of the important technologies or libraries to be fluent in as a [their role / your desired role]?
- What helps a candidate stand out when you’re selecting for promotion or advancement?
- What is the culture of [their company] in terms of work / life balance and expectations?
- What does a normal day / week look like?
- What do teams look like and how are projects carried out?
- In risk analytics / Risk dynamics, what are the industry tools?
- For risk analytics, what are differentiators in top analysts?
- What is the culture like?

The final question I always ask is: 

- How do internal referrals work and would you be willing to submit one on my behalf?

I got some first round interviews or conversations with recruiters through this method, but none of the connections panned out, and I only got one technical interview, which was a coding challenge that I answered 5/6 correct, so was not invited to the next round. 

Now that I had exhausted my first round connections, it was time to go to strangers. I went to company pages on LinkedIn and clicked ""people"" and filtered by Data Scientist / Analyst / Data Engineer, then reached out with the following message:

> Subject Line: **[Fellow University Alum]\* wondering about [Company]**
>
>Hey [name], 
>
>My name is [name] and I just finished up at [school] with an [degree] in [major]! I have a background in [sub-filed] and love what I have seen in the job descriptions at [company], and I was wondering if you wouldn't mind connecting and answering some questions I have about the data scientist role and how your experience has been. Thanks so much for your time!
>
>Best, 
>[name]

\* replace ""Fellow University Alum"" with whatever way you can connect with the person based on their profile. Otherwise just say ""Aspiring Data Scientist"" or something humble and eager.

I got several interviews and referrals from strangers this way. 


**Takeaway:** use your network and reach out to make as many connections as possible in order to learn more about what you want or don't want. They may also be happy to refer you to a position.

## Determining My Professional Goals

I interviewed for the following positions: Intern, Research Associate, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Analyst, Product Analyst, Analyst, Consultant, Product Manager, and others. 

I talked to a lot of people and wanted to understand what motivates them, what they are experiencing in their role, and what they hope for in the future. What skills do they have, and are those skills transferrable? It seems to me that coding practices and statistical intuition are very transferrable, and so I wanted a role that would allow me to improve those two things. I want to be able to transfer what I learn in my next role to future roles, and I'm not attached to any particular industry. So it was important for me to distinguish myself from those who love coding, or those who want a 9-5 without much challenge, or those who want to do analyst work but don't want to become leaders. Benchmarking and measuring your goals and feelings against others similar to you but in different roles and spaces is an excellent way to figure out what you want to do, and even what size of company you prefer. 

My set of values pre-job offer:

- Any size company, but prefer a medium team size, and a company without too much bureaucracy. 
- Exposure to ML as well as data-wrangling, without too much emphasis on one vs. the other. 
- If I can mentor or help more junior developers, I would enjoy that.
- Have an enjoyable connection to other employees during the interview process.
- If possible, a company that has a meaningful contribution to society, or positive local impact.
- Being able to bring my ideas and whole self to the job, not just a clock-in clock-out situation. 


**Takeaway:** find out what positions interest you, and try to craft your profile, projects, and skills to fit that role. Don't be afraid to say no to positions if they don't meet your criteria.

## Staying Motivated

The 2020 turbulence shook everything that wasn't securely tied down. I've spent much of my free time on calls with friends and family about navigating the challenges they are facing this year. I had weekends and whole weeks where I didn't do anything except scroll on reddit, tiktok, IG, etc. and felt like shit. I had other weeks where I felt like a superhero, learning things and gaining confidence, getting a website to work, debugging part of a data pipeline, etc. Here are the things that helped me stay on track:

- Getting enough nutrients and listening to my body's caloric needs.
- Stretching and foam-rolling when I feel stiff or uncomfortable sitting all day.
- Lifting weights or going for a walk.
- Taking one or two weeks to stop applying because of rejection fatigue.
- Scheduling phone calls with other people in the same boat to commiserate.
- Watching stand up comedy on youtube to crack up and laugh to break the day's tension.
- Limiting doom scrolling and hyper vigilance (our house was 2 miles from one of the fires, so that was hard).
- Any time I needed a nap, I took that nap. 
- Unfollow anything that isn't encouraging, uplifting, or useful to me in this period of time.

## Giving Back

I was SO LONELY on this journey, and resources on Reddit have helped me massively. As a way to give back to the community, I want to offer the following things for free: 

- A 10-15 minute zoom call to advise you or answer your questions about how to get the Data Science job you're looking for (limited to how many I can fit in next week and who is in dire need). 
- A tailored response to your personal question or situation via email, or advice on how to improve your resume.
- A follow up post on this subreddit answering the top several questions I get.
- Answering as many questions in the comments as I can. I'll reply [""pass""](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-pass-statement-in-python) in some cases, or refer you to resources that were useful to me. 

**Update: Survey now closed. See Edit #5.** 

**Edit #1**: Formatting, added link to [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/)

**Edit #2:** It's an important note that I worked for 6 years in the nonprofit world before coming back to school. Here's a quote from one of my responses below: 
>""I worked in the nonprofit world and had a lot of different roles and responsibilities, including working abroad in a humanitarian capacity, translating for conferences, logistics and operations, participating in making curriculum for staff and volunteers, casting vision to donors in a fund-development capacity, etc. I wish it were a one-liner 'I worked in software' that would be satisfying or succinct, but it is simply more complicated.""

**Edit #3:** Some people are suggesting that my offers to have a zoom call or offer resume feedback are part of some nefarious ploy to obtain people's information or manipulate them in some way. I'm sorry to hear that. Did you know that there are firms who have been scraping employment data from before the sites had adequate protections in place? I interacted with one such company over the course of my research. It would probably be more efficient for me to make a [LinkedIn Recruiter Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/a417020/personal-account-vs-recruiter?lang=en#:~:text=LinkedIn%20Recruiter%20is%20a%20talent,of%20active%20and%20passive%20candidates.). Then I could have thousands of emails and LinkedIn profiles all for my nefarious purposes! Muahahahaha! For more stories of recruiting shenanigans, check out r/recruitinghell for best practices. Relevant quote from one of my comments below:
> Hey! I made an edit about this. I had hoped to have some verbal conversations if people were interested, since I have a track record of coaching younger students, teaching, and mentorship. It was the first way I could think to give back to this community aside from writing more posts (which I could certainly do). Is there a method you would suggest that might help that come through more effectively? I definitely don't want to send the wrong message. Thanks!

**Edit #4:** Added Preface section to better contextualize my story.

**Edit #5:** I have closed the survey and will be turning off notifications for this post, following up with the folks who filled out the survey, and writing follow up posts if I get feedback that it will be useful. Thanks to all of you for celebrating with me and helping me make sure this post is as useful for the community as possible! I also received some rather hateful messages, and people disbelieving my story and hard work. I am flattered by your disbelief, because it underscores how incredible my journey has been!

opnzmc,Jut got fired,"Hey, just wanted to share this, as I am feeling a bit down and feeling kinda of a failure. Got fired on my 3rd month.

I got my 1st job after graduating with 2 internships under my belt. I felt I was ready to take on the world.

I started to work for a start up, I moved countries, I was really excited about it but apparently I couldn't present results fast enough or accurate enough.

I always like to assume responsibility, as it is the only way to growth.

On my 1st month I was working with the wrong tables, PMs told me to work with those tables, but those were the wrong tables. I eventually found that I had to request special access to my department's tables... and for some reason those tables were hidden from general view...

2nd and 3rd months I was working with SQL+JSON tables plus all the side tasks. Apparently I did not manage to fully understand the concept of SQL + JSON very well. My numbers were always wrong.

The pandemic hasn't been kind to me (and many others, I know) my focus hasn't been what is used to be, I feel slower, less energetic and less smart.. And the other day I was sent by back to my country, yesterday I broke up with a girl I was seeing... Everything sucks at the moment.

I am not really sure what to do. I like SQL, I like helping business making sense of data, I like doing ad-hocs projects in R or Python. Or at least I thought I did...

I am starting to doubt myself, I feel I am not good enough and that Data might not be for me...

I am sure things will get better, but right now they suck very much.

Thanks for reading

EDIT: WOW!! Thank you everyone for the support and kind words. It is also refreshing to read other's peopl experience. It makes me feel less alone in this situation. Thank you for the support, it is really amazing, you are all making me feel way better!!! ""YOU DA BEST"" :D

u1ivbw,How I achieved a 6-figure base salary Data Scientist job with 1 year of work experience and a bachelor's degree.,"EDIT: Here is my resume per request. Please don't reverse-engineer this and leak my info somehow, or track this to something connected to me. Trying to do you all a service without it backfiring. [https://ibb.co/zRGqhq0](https://ibb.co/zRGqhq0) I do want to mention that just DOING interviews made me better. My first interviews were a train-wreck. By the end, I felt like an interview expert.

For context, I am 23yo from the US. I have a Math degree from a no-name university, I have taken 0 bootcamps, and I have only taken intro coding courses. I also have some statistics courses under my belt. I have 1 year of relevant work experience and some projects. Let me not undersell myself, but I am far from an expert-level candidate and I have minimal experience.

Here are my tips for getting an interview and job when you're competing with 100s of candidates that all might have more work experience and advanced degrees.

I must first put out that I am a man of faith, so I give God credit. But after that, here are my tips:

**You need a GREAT resume.**

You are competing with advanced degrees and people who probably have much more experience than you. You cannot get away with a bad resume, you simply will be denied immediately. You must do the following:

* Quantify what you did, and how it impacted the business.
* USE KEYWORDS. I don't care if you just touched Keras, put it somewhere on your resume. Some are against this, but use a Skills section at the bottom to include the keywords and then also include them in your highlights. You're looking to at least get an HR interview, your resume will get you there.
* Find a really good-looking template that stands out. Not color, but with formatting.

**Apply Everywhere**

For me, I used LinkedIn exclusively. I did not apply to anything that made me do much more than submit a resume. Its not worth your time. In my experience, take-home coding tests are only worth your time if you've done a series of interviews, it takes 3 hours or less and, the company has shown interest as well.

* Apply even if you're not qualified (not horribly unqualified though). There's flexibility in YOE. I actually got a job interview with somewhere asking for a Masters and 8+ YOE.

**STUDY UP**

* Understand basic statistics. Seriously. Be able to explain every way you'd perform a test and why. What would you do with unbalanced data? Etc.
* Be able to explain a model thoroughly, why would you use it? I was asked to explain loss, variance, bias, what loss function I might use, etc.
* Practice your coding, most of these are in Python
* You must know SQL, preferably advanced-level. I had more SQL coding questions than anything else.

**KNOW YOUR EMPLOYER**

* They WILL ask you case-study questions. You must be able to think outside the box.
* Act super-enthused about their position, even if you are applying elsewhere and its not your #1

**DON'T GIVE UP**

* I submitted easily over 200 applications, received calls on maybe 20 of them, got to the final interviews on 7, was denied on 5, and offered 2.

**MISTAKES I MADE**

* Not remembering my basic statistics, I actually messed up on one interview about ""How would you describe a p-value to a non-technical audience.""
* Not being able to communicate how my projects impacted the company. I have good project experience, but for my first final interview, I had a lot of trouble trying to explain the business impact and how I solved issues. These need to be fresh in your mind.
* Not acting interested. I had at one time, 5 different companies interviewing me and I didn't have much energy to care about each one. This ruined a few of my chances.
* Not studying on the work department. If you are applying to a marketing position, understand a little about marketing... They chose another candidate when I likely would have been chosen had I known a little more background knowledge.

nmyg3i,First two weeks of my first internship,"Today, I got my first paycheck from my first internship and I am shocked about the entire situation. I come from a poor family, I am the first of my family to college (and grad-school) and the first to have a real professional work experience. I honestly feel blessed to be able to improve on my data science abilities and get paid for it! 

I have been working with the lead data scientist and have learned so much in these past two weeks. I enjoy coming to work and even more so now that I saw the paycheck. 

Sorry for the weird post, but I am just in a good mood right now. 

P.s. My boss asked me if I want to continue my internship for the Fall

**Update**
About 330 days have passed since I first started my internship and things couldn’t be better.
I ended up working remotely during the Fall and part of the spring semester but eventually decided to put my two weeks in - no issue with the company nor work, but decided I needed to allocate some more time on school (one course in particular). Luckily, I have been applying for jobs since September and landed an associate Data Scientist position at a large tech company, not FAANG, and start in August 2022. In this past year my life has changed so much and I am truly grateful for every bit of it. I still feel like I don’t deserve this job or that I’m not good enough, but I hope that this imposter syndrome goes away once I start working.",932,71,royal-Brwn,2021-05-28 13:59:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/nmyg3i/first_two_weeks_of_my_first_internship/,0,datascience

lgiug8,Remember to stop every once in a while and think about how far you've come.,"It's not news to any of us that impostor syndrome is real and that in this field, you'll probably always feel like you don't know anything. But this week, after two years in data science, I finished my first real, entirely self-driven and deployed end-to-end project and, [after publishing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Letterboxd/comments/lfp2h8/as_promised_here_is_a_demo_of_the_recommendation/), I got an e-mail from someone who was excited to learn more about it because they're just starting out on this journey. 

That made me realize that not long ago, I was that person, who would see something like this and have no idea how to do it, but really wanting to know how. And now I do! And of course there are still many things I'm unsure of, completely ignorant of, things I know that I'm doing wrong and things that I don't know that I'm doing wrong - but it feels good to look back and see that I've grown, and that I'm now in the position to help others as others have helped me.

So if you panic or feel helpless when faced with a new, difficult and unfamiliar concept, try to remember that at one point, the things that now come naturally to you also felt that way. And take a second to breathe and realize how far you've come.

r5thf9,I just signed an offer on my first Data Science job,"Hey all, 

Long time lurker of this subreddit. I'm about to graduate with a masters of biomedical data science this may. After an internship with amazon this summer and around 40 applications/15 interviews over the course of the school year I got a job offer from a large tech company. 

The study guides from this subreddit have helped me the whole way through and I genuinely wanted to thank the community again. I started out with an undergraduate degree in biology/stats, and have self taught programming based on the advice given from this sub. I started reading it as a junior in my undergrad as I was trying trying transition from biology to analytics. While sometimes there can be discouraging posts, the advice some users give has really made an impact on me and given me insight into the career field that I was able to use when choosing my courses or finding skills to work on in my free time. 

I come from a very underprivileged background of poverty, paid my way though both my degrees alone, and have struggled with imposter syndrome as a woman in CS. I just want others to know that you don't have to be the best, get straight As or land the first interview to be worthy of a good job. I have really struggled this year and felt terrible about 2 out of my 5 interview rounds but still somehow found myself with a substantial offer letter. 

So this is where I am now. I'm excited, don't even feel like it's real yet, but I'm also anxious for the future and want to prove myself even more. 

I'm not sure if it would be of any help, but I wanted to try and give back to the community. If anyone wants to know my interview experience or my experience with applications I'd be happy to talk about it with them in the comments or DMs. I'll try to get back to as many people as possible if there is interest.

uryrot,Data Science is Seductive,"I joined this mid-sized financial industry company (\~500 employees) some time ago as a Dev Manager. One thing lead to another and now I'm a Data Science Manager. 

I am not an educated Data Scientist. No PhD or masters, just a CS degree + 15 years of software development experience, mostly with Python and Java. I always liked analytics and data, and over the years I did a lot of *data sciency* work (e.g: pretty reports with insights, predictions, dashboards, etc...) that management and different stakeholders appreciated a lot. My biggest project, although personal, was a website that would automatically collect covid related data and make predictions on how it will evolve. It was quite a big thing in my country and at one point I had more than 5M views daily. It was entirely a hobby project that went viral, but I learned a lot from it and this is what made me interested in actual data science.

About two years ago, before I joined the company, they started building a Data Science team. They hired a Fortune 500 Data Scientist with a lot of experience under his belt, but not so much management experience. With the help of a more experienced manager, with no relation to Data Science, he had the objective to put together the team and start delivery. In about 6 months the team was ready. It was entirely PhD level. One year later the manager left and so did the team. It's hard for me to say what really happened. Management says they haven't delivered what they were supposed to, while the team was saying the expectations were too high. Probably the truth is somewhere in the middle. As soon as the manager resigned, they asked me directly if I want to build and lead the new team. I was somehow ""famous"" because of the covid website. There was also a big raise involved which convinced me to bypass the *impostor syndrome*. Anyway, I am now leading a new team I put together. 

I had about 50 interviews over the next couple of months. Most of the people I hired were not data scientists per se, but they all knew Python quite well and were **very** detail oriented. Management was somehow surprised on why I'm not hiring PhD level, but they went along with it.

Personally, I hated the fact that most PhDs I've interviewed didn't want to do any data engineering, devops, testing or even reports. I'm not saying that they should be focused on these areas, but they should be able to sometimes do a little bit of them. Especially reports. In my books, as a data scientist you deliver insights extracted from data. Insights are delivered via reports that can take many forms. If you're not capable of reporting the insights you extracted in a way that stakeholders can understand, you are not a data scientist. Not a good one at least...

I started collecting the needs from business and see how they can be solved ""via data science"". They were all over the place. From fraud detection with NLU on e-mails and text recognition over invoices to chatbots and sales predictions. Took me some time to educate them on what low hanging fruits are and to understand what they want without them actually telling me what they want. I mean, most of the stuff they wanted were pure sci-fi level requirements, but in reality what they needed were simple regressions, classifiers and analytics. Some guy wanted to build a chatbot using neural gases, because he saw a cool video about it on youtube.

Less than a month later we went in production with a pretty dashboard that shows some sales metrics and makes predictions on future sales and customer churn. They were all blown away by it and congratulated us for doing it entirely ourselves without asking for any help, especially on the devops side of things. Very important to mention that I had the huge advantage of already understanding how the company works, where the data is and what it means, how the infrastructure is put together and how it can be leveraged. Without this knowledge it would have probably took A LOT longer.

Six months have passed and the team goes quite well. We're making deployments in production every two weeks and management is very happy with our work.

Company has this internship program where grads come in and spend two 3-month long rotations in different teams. After these two rotations some of them get hired as permanent employees. At the beginning of each rotation we have a so called marketplace where each team ""sells"" their work and what a grad can learn from joining the team. They can do front-end, back-end, data engineering, devops, qa, *data science*, etc... They can choose from anything on the software development spectrum. They specify their options in order and then HR decides on where each one goes.

This week was the 3rd time our team was part of the marketplace. And this was the 3rd time ALL grads choose as their first option the data science team. What they don't know is that all previous grads we had in the team decided Data Science is not for them. Their feedback was that there's too much of a hustle to understand the data and that they're not really doing any of the cool AI stuff they've seen on YouTube.

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that data science is very seductive. It seduces management to dream for insights that will make them rich and successful, it seduces grads to think they will build J.A.R.V.I.S. and it seduces some data scientists to think it is ok not to do the ""dirty"" work.

At the end of the day, it's just me that got seduced into thinking that it is ok to share this on reddit after a couple of beers.",879,105,drake10k,2022-05-17 22:58:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/uryrot/data_science_is_seductive/,0,datascience

m3in2j,Can't land a data internship? Try volunteering for a political campaign's data team,"I've seen a few posts about how to find volunteer opportunities, or get experience before you are able to land a full-time job.  One avenue I've used to get experience was volunteering for a political campaign's data team.  Campaigns are ALWAYS looking for extra help, and will usually be happy to assign you some easy data cleaning or analysis tasks that you can use to hone your skills.

To get started, I reached out to the data/tech director for a mid-size PAC (after finding them on LinkedIn) and asked if they had any data volunteering opportunities.  If you can't find this person, reach out to anyone in the campaign and ask if they know who to talk to.  Within a few days they had me sign an NDA and I was working on getting insights out of their textbanking data - figuring out which messaging was working best, weeding out phone numbers that volunteers should have added to the opt-out list but didn't, etc.

iorbjg,Experience/Advice from a 10+ year data scientist,"For context, I was in most people's shoes here so this is why I want to give back some advice and inspiration. There's a bit of misinformation in this subreddit so I'll consolidate my thinking. DM me if you need specific advice

Background:

1. Been working in quant/data science for 10-11 years now. Didn't know where to go because this field didn't exist when I was in school.
2. Self-taught. This is where my imposter syndrome appears but little did anyone know this. Learned SQL through sqlzoo, learned R as a hobby to day-trade (yahoo-finance api, zoo package, etc.), Python through codeschool(?) or codeacademy(?) in 2012 (it was free back then), Math through OCW/torrented whitepapers & textbooks, ML through whitepapers & textbooks (coursera did not exist yet)
3. Interviewed around a lot and got rejected a lot (100+). When I first began, this was not a field, but the interview process & rejections gave me grit and understand what to study. I interviewed for a lot of exciting startups (now public companies) before they were even big. A small hedge fund gave me a chance as a quant trader, and our group got shut down in a year. I got a second chance somewhere else and the company went public (data science was central to their strategy)
4. Data Science is exciting. This field has brought me around the world. Worked at a hedge fund, electricity markets, global consulting, somehow ended up doing A.I work, and now in a strategy role. I don't oversee data scientists anymore, they mostly report to my business function now but previously managed 20+ data scientists.  Worked all over the globe and across many, many states. 

Advice:

1. Study and code everyday. Make it a habit. Blog posts, whitepapers, textbooks. I've lost this habit and I regret it -- getting back into it. You should love learning, otherwise you're in the wrong field.
2. Build up your foundations. Python/R, Probability/Stats/Calculus/LinAlg/DiffEq, Algorithms. This will help you understand a lot . Do take an algorithms & design course. Most problems are solved through a design approach / framework rather than a model.
3. Stay in touch with whats going on. hackernews/datatau/rweekly & understanding  new Data Engineering trends, Tech Engineering Blogs. Example, when I read some company blog about their implementation of spark in 2014, I immediately started playing around with it with my models.
4. Always be humble & prepare to get humbled but remain self-confident and determined. Don't be afraid.
5. Find a subject you like to get started. Loving data & modeling is one thing, but find an area that really interests you. For me, I started with time series (not for the faint of heart). This introduced me to a lot of difficult concepts.
6. Find a product/field. For me it was Energy & Finance. It can be marketing, sales, finance, pure ML, pure optimization work, supply chain, etc. Being a general hobbyist will only get you so far.

Lastly, Data science is not all SQL. It depends on how close you are to the revenue generating side. If you’re making a quarterly report on demand, that isn’t data science. If you’re building growth models to accelerate users on your platform that tie to scale and revenue. SQL will get your dad but still have to come up with model",872,86,misterpoolittle,2020-09-08 10:41:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/iorbjg/experienceadvice_from_a_10_year_data_scientist/,0,datascience
rsfdlx,"To the companies that send candidates a 3 hour take-home test, and then say their corporate policy does not permit feedback after one is rejected...","Your hiring process is terrible and you absolutely have a terrible policy.

Job hunting is already a crappy, long and unrewarding activity, and at the very least feedback would be helpful to help candidates improve their chances in their job hunt for the next role they apply to.

It's not only the 3 hour test that's stressful, but even before doing the test we have to review and refresh our knowledge because we've all been pigeonholed one way or another at our respective firms. It's a 3 hour test for you, but it's days/weeks of studying, interviewing, holding current job, juggling with shit on our end. And we're trying to re-learn so many things that you claim is ""normal day to day operation"" at your firm for data scientists.

And quite frankly, I call that bs that your day to day ops includes advanced statistics or measuring bayesian probability by hand. Just like how my firm claims the role for our job requires coding in Python and statistics, only to realize that daily tasks are to run reports from Google Analytics/Adobe Analytics.

13k8665,"I posted for a Data Analyst, this is what you are competing against","Our org needs a new data analyst, so I wrote up a job description with the skillset I needed and passed it off to our HR director to do what she needed and post it. I didn't put any degree requirement on it, I put responsibilities and real tools the new hire would be expected to work with. It is a remote role. I started looking for the posting, but couldn't find it, so I asked for a copy because my LinkedIn was getting attention indicating it existed somewhere.

I expected this response if I had posted for a Data Scientist role, but I didn't. I posted for a Data Analyst.

She took it down. There were 255 applicants in less than 24 hours. She sifted through half of them, excluded those who weren't already authorized to work in the US and those who didn't show English proficiency through their resume, and then forwarded me 9. I don't know that the 9 was all of the viable candidates that remained, they did seem to be biased to areas we have a footprint in the US, and I had just requested a sample.

Of those 9, 3 were absolutely new to the field. They put a data analytics certificate, but didn't even list which of the languages indicated on the posting they already knew. They didn't list any projects, just their previous work history (which was at best adjacent to the field). I looked up their certificates quickly and then moved on. List your technical skills - I'm not looking for ""good attitude, can learn"", I want to know how you've gotten yourself started in ways that are relevant to what I need. Your certificate only matters in what it taught you, not that you have it.

I had 4 that were on point. They had the skills I had listed and then a few, and they either had relevant work experience or a history of coursework (online or through universities) that showed they would have a good framework to start from.

Two were overqualified. Their experience was legitimately as data engineers. I assume they actually read the posting, so they remain in consideration, but their skills are beyond the specifics I need. I can't justify paying them more unless I can find ways that benefit the org to use those extra skills. I assume they will drop themselves from consideration when we talk more, so if I were in a time crunch, I would cut them from my list. Wishful thinking on getting a unicorn isn't a good use of my time.

I figured this was an opportunity for some perspective, seeing that we get ""what do I need to do to get a role"" posts all the time. I don't know what response I would have received if I had region locked this to around our HQ, or if we were offering hybrid or on-site work.

Just to add - I am not accepting resumes through here. I'm also ignoring anyone who finds my or my coworkers' LinkedIns and sends us resumes outside the standard process. I've already seen those happen.

&#x200B;

Edit to add: I also considered projects in the ""on point"" group - they showed they applied the skills.

Update: I checked with HR, the pay was included in the post. To be clear, it was mid-3rd quartile  for a Data Analyst position - we weren't posting anything with an amazing rate. It's very possible people submitted without reading the details, especially given the skill mismatches I see. I feel better about it, because I could not have written a more honest description of the role, so they had full information.

Also, 27 resumes were forwarded to me so far. I have sent 10 back for follow up, with another 5 to be written up on my side.",866,285,greenearrow,2023-05-17 17:22:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/13k8665/i_posted_for_a_data_analyst_this_is_what_you_are/,0,datascience

I have a masters degree in statistics, have 12+ years of experience in statistical data analysis and 6+ in Machine Learning. I've built production machine learning models for 3 FAANG companies and have presented my work in various industry conferences. It's not to brag, but to tell you that I have actual industry experience. And despite all this, I wouldn't dare call myself an ""AI Practitioner, let alone ""AI Expert"".

I recently came across someone on LinkedIn through someone I follow and they claim they are the ""Forbes AI Innovator of the Year"" (if you know, you know). The only reference I find to this is an interview on a YouTube channel of a weird website that is handing out awards like ""AI Innovator of the Year"".

Their twitter, medium and LinkedIn all have 10s of thousands of followers, each effusing praise on how amazing it is that they are making AI accessible. Their videos, tweets, and LinkedIn posts are just some well packaged b-school bullshit with a bunch of buzzwords.

I see many people following them and asking for advice to break into the field and they're just freely handing them away. Most of it is just platitudes like - *believe in yourself, everyone can learn AI, etc.*

I actually searched on forbes for ""AI Innovator of the Year"" and couldn't find any mention of this person. Forbes does give out awards for innovations in AI, but they seem to be for actual products and startups focused on AI (none of which this person is a part of).

On one hand, I want to bust their bullshit and call them out on it fairly publicly. On the other hand, I don't want to stir unnecessary drama on Twitter/LinkedIn, especially because they seem to have fairly senior connections in the industry?

At some point, as housing, education and healthcare costs takes up a higher and higher % of everyone's paycheck (from 20% to 50%, eventually 85%) there will be so little wealth left to extract that our ""relatively"" tiny cut of 100-200k per year will become an absolutely tiny cut as well.

17m8la5,I applied to 250 jobs and timed how long each one took,"Applying to jobs online is like navigating a maze.

Amidst the special torture that is resume parsing software, the inability to reuse information across different application tracking systems (ATS), and the existence of a certain company that rhymes with every day of the week, it can get pretty frustrating.

I wanted to explore what factors make a job application more or less frustrating.

For example, what industries have the worst application processes? Do big companies ask for more information than small companies? What is it about websites like Workday that make them really hard to use?

To answer these questions, I applied to 250 jobs. One by one. Click by click. No Linkedin Easy Apply, no shortcuts – just straight from the careers page.

I timed how long it took me to go from “apply to job” to “submit application”.

https://preview.redd.it/adj6ge9jvyxb1.png?width=2820&format=png&auto=webp&s=2123533d9d04aabcdd5988471274ee2ed3b98704

Make no mistake: I sacrificed my soul for this post. I created over 83 accounts and spent a total of 11 hours scrolling. I was originally going to do this for 500 companies, but wanted to chop my head off halfway.

I did this for a mix of companies – Fortune 500 to early stage startups, spread out across different industries from software to manufacturing. The *type* of role I applied to was kept constant: engineering / product focused.

https://preview.redd.it/ttn8yd1mvyxb1.png?width=2266&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27a52217e85bfade6eb30f0b696914eac7fc270

The outcome? An average of over two and a half minutes per application—162 seconds of your life you'll never get back. But as we dig deeper, you'll discover that these 162 seconds only scratch the surface of an often maddening process.

*Key Takeaways*

* **Average Application Time:** On average, it took a bit over two and a half minutes to apply to a job.
* **Company Size Impact:** If company size doubles, the application time increases by 5%. If company size increases by a factor of 10, then the app time increases by 20%.
* **Industry Influence:** Being a government company is the single largest determinant of a long application, followed closely by aerospace and consulting firms.
* **Longest Application:** The longest application time went to the United States Postal Service (10 minutes and 12 seconds).
* **Shortest Application:** On the other hand, It took me just 17 seconds to apply to Renaissance Technologies.
* **ATS Impact:** Older ATS like Workday and Taleo make job applications as much as 128% longer.

Let's dive in.

# The Setup

There’s no real method to the 250 companies I pick. I’m just typing names into Google and trying to vary it up. Where does Trisha work? What was that billboard I saw? It's all up for grabs.

Here’s the distribution of the 250 companies by size:

Some examples of companies in each range:

* 1-500 → Glean, Quizlet, Gumroad
* 500-5,000 → Notion, Dolby, Moloco
* 5,000-50,000 → Airbnb, Genentech, Logitech
* 50,000-100,000 → HP, American Express, Pfizer
* 100,000+ → Wells Fargo, Lockheed Martin, General Motors

And here’s a look at the different types of industries represented:

# What makes a job application so frustrating

Generally speaking, the more frustrating a job application, the longer it takes to complete.

The three main factors that might influence how long a job application is (as measured in my data):

1. **Company size** → I would expect bigger companies to ask more questions.
2. **The ATS that is being used** → I would expect clunkier, older ATS to make job applications longer.
3. **Company industry** → I would expect more “traditional” industries to ask more questions.

We’re going to model the relationship between the above three factors and the amount of time it takes to complete a job application. To do this, we’re going to use a technique called linear regression.

Regression is about the way two measurements change together. It can help us make predictions.

For example, if I add 10 employees to a company, how many seconds will that add to the company’s job application process?

Since we have other factors like ATS and Industry, we will also account for those. For now, though, let’s just focus on each factor one by one.

# Company Size

Let’s first plot the data as is:

https://preview.redd.it/sdvfivrzvyxb1.png?width=3276&format=png&auto=webp&s=37d9d55db8d0fef37d0365c523a0c1ba7e3e4199

Yes, I know, this isn’t the most useful graph. I’m going to spruce it up real quick, I promise.

The United States Postal Service has a job application that took over 10 minutes to complete. Navigating their portal felt like using Internet Explorer in 2003:

https://preview.redd.it/40iu1ni2wyxb1.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7b65699a39f2e4e3c3abadf38875280a673a0d7

Netflix’s application was just 20 seconds - their only mandatory requirements are your resume and basic info.

https://preview.redd.it/sl4fums4wyxb1.png?width=2310&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c0c87299460bd22163f34db1040a56ea3893059

Apple took me 71 seconds, still pretty fast for a company that has over 270,000 employees (PWC, which has a similar number of employees, took me almost six times as long).

Okay, back to the chart. There are a couple of problems with it.

First, the data is not linear. This is a problem if we want to use linear regression.

Second, the company size scale is hard to interpret because of the many data points clumped together near zero (representing all the smaller companies).

We can resolve both these issues with the following insight:

There is a big difference between going from 10 to 100 employees and, say, 10,000 to 10,100 employees. The first represents major changes in company structure: you might actually hire a proper HR team, a bunch of recruiters, and build out your candidate experience. The second, though, is pretty much just business as usual - think of a multinational opening up a satellite office or a regular month of hiring.

Since we want to account for this, our data is better suited to a log scale than a linear scale. I will also transform our Y-axis, the application time, to a log scale because it helps normalize the data.

If we plot both our variables on a log-log scale, we get the below chart:

https://preview.redd.it/5l4po6d8wyxb1.png?width=4304&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3199197ea1b608fc39b8c3626ab994dc9d5eb5e

Better right? This is the same data as the last chart, but with different axes that fits the data better, we observe a linear relationship.

We have the usual suspects in the top right: Government organizations, professional services firms, and some of the tech industry dinosaurs.

The variance in application times across smaller companies, like startups, is interesting. For example, many of the startups with longer application times (e.g OpenAI, Posthog, Comma.AI) reference that they are looking for “exceptional” candidates on their careers page. (Note that OpenAI has changed its application since I last analyzed it - it’s now much faster, but when I went through they asked for a mini essay on why you’re exceptional).

One thing that I was expecting to see was competitors mirroring each other’s application times. This is most closely represented with the consulting firms like Deloitte, E&Y, KPMG, etc all clumped together. McKinsey and Bain, the two most prestigious consulting firms, have applications that take longer to complete.

This doesn’t necessarily seem to be the case with the FAANG companies.

We can also calculate the correlation coefficient for this graph. This is a statistical measure of the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. The closer to 1 the value, the stronger the relationship.

For the above data, we get a correlation coefficient of 0.58, which is a moderate to strong association.

Note that on its own, this doesn't tell us anything about causation. But it does start to point us in some type of direction.

It's not rocket science: big companies ask for more stuff. Sometimes they ask for the last 4 digits of your SSN.

https://preview.redd.it/c7g5717bwyxb1.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=38c776e46d45d179a6627ba3470fd4f89ca04204

Sometimes they even ask if you’d be okay going through a polygraph:

https://preview.redd.it/1q52rzldwyxb1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3b8921e055d38e04ee7395e9b982fa50c38f9df

An argument here is that if big companies didn’t have some sort of barriers in their application process, they’d get swarmed with applications.

Consider the fact that Google gets 3 million applications every year. Deloitte gets 2 million. Without some sort of initial friction in the application process, those numbers would be even higher. That friction almost serves as a reliable filter for interest.

If you’re an employer, you don’t really care about the people using a shotgun approach to apply. You want the candidates that have a real interest in the position. On the other hand, if you’re a candidate, the reality is such that the shotgun approach to apply is arguably the most efficient.

So we have this inherent tension between companies and candidates. Candidates want the most bang for their buck, companies don’t want thousands of irrelevant resumes.

And in the middle, we have the plethora of application tracking software that can often be quite old and clunky.

# ATS

Everytime I came face to face with a company that used Workday as their ATS, I died a bit inside. This is because Workday makes you:

1. create a new account every single time
2. redirects you away from the careers page

I defined a redirect as one when the job description is not listed on the same page as the first input box part of the application.

This isn’t a perfectly accurate measure, but it does allow us to differentiate between the modern ATS like Greenhouse and older ones like Workday.

With every ATS, I implicitly had some type of “how easy is this going to be” metric in my head.

We can try to represent this “how easy is this going to be” metric a bit more concretely using the matrix below.

https://preview.redd.it/bvpeu47iwyxb1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=818191eb4a0a5924c582f3ad7ec9539bc510f6fa

Ideally, you want the ATS to be in the bottom left corner. This creates an experience that is low friction and fast.

If we plot application time versus ATS, this is what we get:

https://preview.redd.it/pe9zyxmkwyxb1.png?width=3184&format=png&auto=webp&s=8df5c1118f9f0044e2154c8ae63816332ca42d67

The ATS that don’t make you create an account and don’t redirect you are tied to lower application times than the ones that do.

One possibility is that certain companies are more likely to use certain ATS. Big companies might use Workday for better compliance reporting. Same with the industry - maybe B2C software companies use the newer ATS on the market. These would be confounding variables, meaning that we may misinterpret a relationship between the ATS and the application time when in fact there isn’t one (and the real relationship is tied to the industry or size).

So to properly understand whether the ATS actually has an effect on application time, we need to control for our other variables. We’ll do this in the final section when we run a regression including all our variables.

One of the big frustrations surrounding different ATS is that when you upload your resume, you then need to retype out your experience in the boxes because the ATS resume parser did it incorrectly. For example, I went to UC Berkeley but sometimes got this:

https://preview.redd.it/ay21vccnwyxb1.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=9862b0860c49c87a76b02218f8e4118134acfb89

The only resume parser that didn't seem abysmal was the one from Smart Recruiters. TikTok's resume parser also isn't bad.

Another frustrating experience is tied to inconsistency between the company I'm applying to and the ATS.

https://preview.redd.it/9xzq21vpwyxb1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=8432b293be4db0f58770760097df0117b53e667e

A company’s application process is often the first touchpoint you have with their brand. Startups competing for the best talent can't afford extra steps in their process. Apple and Facebook can.

Whilst the average time to complete a job application may only be 162 seconds, the fact that many ATS require steps like account creation and authentication can lead to application fatigue.

It’s not necessarily the explicit amount of time it takes, it’s the steps involved that drain you of energy and make you want to avoid applying to new jobs.

# Industry

Okay, so far we’ve looked at company size and the ATS as a loose indicator of what might make a job application frustrating. What about the company industry?

You would expect industries like banking or professional services to have longer application times, because getting those jobs revolves around having a bunch of credentials which they likely screen for (and ask you to submit) early on in the process.

On the other hand, internet startups I’d expect to be quick and fast. Let’s find out if this is true.

https://preview.redd.it/i7825ssvwyxb1.png?width=4012&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f51989a663cf7b8c664eacb983a9be0a8dbc80b

Hyped up industries like AI and Crypto have shorter application times. As expected, banks and consulting firms care about your GPA and ask you to submit it.

A government company has to basically verify your identity before they can even receive your application, so the process is entirely different and reflected in the submission time.

For many technology companies, the application process is almost like an extension of the company’s brand itself. For example, Plaid (an API first Fintech company), has a neat option where you can actually apply to the job via API:

https://preview.redd.it/px5k5wwxwyxb1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=d669e7e47e77e51d48a4867a2d06d27125617ed8

Roblox, a gaming company, allows people to submit job applications from within their [games](https://gamerant.com/roblox-company-interview-job-applicants-in-game/).

We also notice differences between legacy companies and their newer competitors. If we compare legacy banks versus neobanks (like Monzo, Mercury, etc), the legacy players averaged around 250 seconds per job application whereas the neobanks averaged less than 60 seconds.

If you can’t compete on prestige, you need to find other ways. One of those ways can be through asking for less information upfront.

# Putting it together

Now that we've analyzed each variable - the company size, ATS, and the industry - to understand the separate relationship of each to application time, we can use linear regression to understand the *combined* relationships.

This will allow us to determine what factors actually have an impact on the job application time versus which ones might just have had one when we looked at them in isolation.

After some number crunching in R, I get the following results (I’ve only added the statistically significant factors – the ones with the “strongest evidence”):

https://preview.redd.it/g2pg1o11xyxb1.png?width=2496&format=png&auto=webp&s=2efc92ad2cfa4aaf25297d23c228d0c7343729f9

Here’s how you can interpret some of the information above:

* When a job app is for a company that is within the Government industry, the submission time goes up by 366% (assuming the size and ATS are constant). For the aerospace industry, this is 249% (and so on).
* When a job app is for a company using the Workday ATS, the submission times goes up by 128% (assuming the size and industry are constant). For the Phenom ATS, this is 110% (and so on).
* Our only (statistically significant) metric which seems to make job applications faster is the Lever ATS (42% shorter).

Okay, now what about company size?

Well, first up: company size is indeed statistically significant. So there is an effect.

However, its effect is not as strong as most of our other variables. To be precise, here are some ways to interpret our company size coefficient:

* If company size doubles, the app size increases by 5%
* If company size increases by a factor of 10, then the app time increases by 20%

This is a smaller effect size compared to ATS or industry (a 20% increases in app time for a 10x large company is a qualitatively smaller effect size than e.g. a 100% increase in app time for Taleo ATS). So although company size is statistically significant, it is not as strong of a driver as ATS and industry of app time.

# Wrapping it up

Two and a half minutes might not be too long, but it can feel like an eternity when you’re forced to answer the same questions and upload the same documents. Over and over again.

Think about catching a flight. All you want is to get on the jet. Hawaii awaits.

But first: the security line. You have to take your shoes off. You get patted down and your bag gets searched. The gate numbers don’t make sense. And then at the end of it, your flight’s delayed. Congrats.

Applying to a job can feel similar. All you want to do is say aloha to the hiring manager, a real human being.

To even have the remote possibility of making that happen, you need to create an account and password, check your email, retype your entire resume, tell them the color of your skin, and explain why this company you’ve never heard of before is the greatest thing on Earth.

And for what? Most likely for the privilege of receiving an automated email about two weeks later rejecting you.

If we make it tiring and unappealing to look for new opportunities, then we prevent people from doing their best work.

But what would a world where applying took just a few seconds actually look like? Recruiters would get bombarded with resumes. It's possible to argue that job applications taking so long is a feature, not a bug. You get to filter for intent and narrow down your application pool.

Is it fair to shift the burden of screening unqualified candidates onto good candidates that now need to provide so much information? Shouldn’t that burden fall on the recruiter?

The truth is that applying to a job via the careers page is a bit of a rigged game. The odds are not in your favor.

Sometimes, though, all you need is to only be right once.

vzmcc2,Some ideas to improve your LinkedIn profile,"Hey everyone,

We're entering difficult economic times, so I thought I could share some of the tactics I've used to get more job opportunities my way by making my LinkedIn (LI) profile stand out.

I'm not an influencer on LI nor I have insider information about its talent search algorithm. This information comes from reading papers about LI's search algorithms, researching LI Recruiter, and a lot trial and error experimenting with my own profile.

Let me begin by setting the stage.

To find candidates, recruiters use a tool called LI Recruiter. It allows them to enter relevant search terms such as ""Data Scientist"" and define filters such as ""has worked at Google"" to look for candidates.

After a query is defined, LI Recruiter uses a ""talent search algorithm"" that works in two stages:

1. It searches the network and defines a set of a few thousand candidates who meet the recruiter's search criteria.
2. Then the candidates are ranked based on how well they fit the search term and how likely they are to respond.

That's it. If your goal is to get more job opportunities your way, then you need to figure out how to improve your chances of appearing in 1 and ranking higher in 2.

Luckily, LI has published research about its talent search algorithm. It's not hard to get an idea of what will help you stand out from the  competition. Based on my research and experience, here are some things that should help your profile stand-out:

1. **Use relevant keywords in your profile.** You won't appear in the results if you don't include terms in your profile that recruiters use when they search for candidates. Review the keywords used in Job descriptions of the positions you're interested in, and make sure you have those in your profile.
2. **Reply to recruiters.** People often don't reply to recruiters when they're not interested in the job  opportunity. But the algorithm prioritizes those who are likely to  respond over those who are not. Respond to recruiters, even if it's just  to say no!
3. **Grow your network.** The lightweight version of LI  Recruiter only lets recruiters reach out to candidates up to their  3rd-degree network. Having few connections decreases your chances of  getting contacted.
4. **Gain influence.** You rank higher if you create  engaging content, have many visitors to your profile, or receive  endorsements and recommendations. As a general rule, try to write useful  content periodically and ask for recommendations from relevant  connections.
5. **Make relevant connections.** Wanna work at X? Make meaningful connections from X and interact with the brand. When recruiters from X are looking for candidates, you will rank higher.
6. **Use a photo.** This is based on my personal experience. A photo, especially a ""good"" one, increases the likelihood that recruiters will contact you.

If you have any questions, shoot me a message. And just for reference, here's [my profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylanjcastillo/).

Here are some images and highlights from the papers and research:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/xbj733/i\_got\_a\_job\_at\_a\_hedge\_fund\_as\_senior\_student/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/xbj733/i_got_a_job_at_a_hedge_fund_as_senior_student/)

Some Redditors asked me in private about the process. The interview process was competitive. One step of the process was a ML task, and the goal was to minimize the error metric. It was basically a single-player Kaggle competition. For most of the candidates, this was the hardest step of the recruitment process. Feature engineering and cross-validation were the two most important skills for the task. I did well due to my Kaggle knowledge, reading popular notebooks, and following ML practitioners on Kaggle/Github. For feature engineering and cross-validation, Kaggle is the best resource by far. Academic books and lectures are so outdated for these topics.

What I see in social media so often is underestimating Kaggle and other data science platforms. Of course in some domains, there are more important things than model accuracy. But in some domains, model accuracy is the ultimate goal. Financial domain goes into this cluster, you have to beat brilliant minds and domain experts, consistently. I've had academic research experience, beating benchmarks is similar to Kaggle competition approach. Of course, explainability, model simplicity, and other parameters are fundamental. I am not denying that. But I believe among Machine Learning professionals, Kaggle is still an underestimated platform, and this needs to be changed.

Edit: I think I was a little bit misunderstood. Kaggle is not just a competition platform. I've learned so many things from discussions, public notebooks. By saying Kaggle is important, I'm not suggesting grinding for the top %3 in the leaderboard. Reading winning solutions, discussions for possible data problems, EDA notebooks also really helps a junior data scientist.",834,138,bluesformetal,2022-09-17 18:43:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/xgu9wg/kaggle_is_very_very_important/,0,datascience

j1q5w2,Data Scientist = Web Master from the 90s,"This is something I've been thinking for a while and feel needs to be said. The title ""data scientist"" now is what the title ""Web Master"" was back in the 90s. 

For those unfamiliar with a Web Master, this title was given to someone who did graphic design, front and back end web development and SEO - everything related to a website. This has now become several different jobs as it needs to be.  

Data science is going through the same thing. And we're finally starting to see it branch out into various disciplines. So when the often asked question, ""how do I become a data scientist"" comes up, you need to think about (or explore and discover) what part(s) you enjoy.

For me, it's applied data science. I have no interest in developing new algorithms, but love taking what has been developed and applying it to business applications. I frequently consult with machine learning experts and work with them to develop solutions into real world problems.  They work their ML magic and I implement it and deliver it to end users (remember, no one pays you to just do data science for data science sake, there's always a goal).

TLDR;
So in conclusion, data science isn't really a job, it's a job category. Find what interested you in that and that will greatly help you figure out what you need to learn and the path you should take.

vceaxx,So many bad masters,"In the last few weeks I have been interviewing candidates for a graduate DS role. When you look at the CVs (resumes for my American friends) they look great but once they come in and you start talking to the candidates you realise a number of things…
1. Basic lack of statistical comprehension, for example a candidate today did not understand why you would want to log transform a skewed distribution. In fact they didn’t know that you should often transform poorly distributed data. 
2. Many don’t understand the algorithms they are using, but they like them and think they are ‘interesting’. 
3. Coding skills are poor. Many have just been told on their courses to essentially copy and paste code.
4. Candidates liked to show they have done some deep learning to classify images or done a load of NLP. Great, but you’re applying for a position that is specifically focused on regression. 
5. A number of candidates, at least 70%, couldn’t explain CV, grid search. 
6. Advice - Feature engineering is probably worth looking up before going to an interview.

There were so many other elementary gaps in knowledge, and yet these candidates are doing masters at what are supposed to be some of the best universities in the world. The worst part is a that almost all candidates are scoring highly +80%. To say I was shocked at the level of understanding for students with supposedly high grades is an understatement. These universities, many Russell group (U.K.), are taking students for a ride. 

If you are considering a DS MSc, I think it’s worth pointing out that you can learn a lot more for a lot less money by doing an open masters or courses on udemy, edx etc. Even better find a DS book list and read a books like ‘introduction to statistical learning’. Don’t waste your money, it’s clear many universities have thrown these courses together to make money.

Note. These are just some examples, our top candidates did not do masters in DS. The had masters in other subjects or, in the case of the best candidate, didn’t have a masters but two years experience and some certificates. 

Note2. We were talking through the candidates own work, which they had selected to present. We don’t expect text book answers for for candidates to get all the questions right. Just to demonstrate foundational knowledge that they can build on in the role. The point is most the candidates with DS masters were not competitive.",797,443,AugustPopper,2022-06-14 21:38:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/vceaxx/so_many_bad_masters/,0,datascience
ons0gh,"FYI: If You're New to the Industry, the Data Science Job Market is Saturated","For the billionth time, the data science job market for people with 0-4 years is so saturated. 

There are 100s of university creating new masters degrees, certificates, under-grad majors. 100s of bootcamps, etc. 

The supply of entry level workers is probably double if not triple the demand(made up statistic). Every job I apply for, there's 50 other people with masters or PHD degree trying to enter.

n10o03,Thank you r/datascience & r/dataisbeautiful - you guys helped me get my dream job! ❤️,"Context: I used to love working with technology. When I was younger I did computer science at school, worked at Apple at 17 & had work experience at Toshiba Research Europe. Everything was going great until I got my GCSE grades back and realised my coursework was terrible. It wasn’t my fault but rather the teacher had taught us the complete wrong thing to do and only 1 person managed to pass. He was fired but when it came to A Levels I didn’t end up picking computer science. As much as I wanted to, I was anxiety riddled as a teenager and I didn’t believe in myself to do it. I ended up going to university, dropping out because of severe depression & going into bookkeeping. Then lockdown happened. I had so much free time that I ended up doing programming for fun & I got Reddit to try and find fixes to syntax errors when I’m programming but Reddit recommended me this subreddit & data is beautiful and I would check it everyday just because I found it interesting & it was the perfect blend between number crunching and technology - leading me to learn Python & get better with excel.

Fast forward to a few days ago and I manage to get an interview with an amazing employer to work as a Junior Data Analyst. I was really worried because I didn’t know who or what the competition was but I did my best & I mentioned that I followed these pages on Reddit. Turns out they only interviewed one other person and I had the edge as I used Reddit & taught myself in my spare time showing huge enthusiasm! Thank you to everyone on this page you are all legends!!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️




TLDR; I fucked up computer science when I was a teen even though I loved it so much.

lqozmp,My first technical interview experience(22+ interview questions),"Today, I had a 45mins technical interview with a media based company and I thought I'd share the questions with you all since so many people on this subreddit are looking for jobs. I hope it helps someone! :)

**Background:**

I currently work as a DS and I have 1.5 years of work ex in the data and analytics field. I was initially hired as a DA so my interview was based on SQL which was quite easy (i'm a CS undergrad). I later got promoted to a DS position so I hadn't faced any serious technical DS interviews until today.

**Technical Questions asked:**

1. How would you go about predicting hotel prices for a company like [Booking.com](https://Booking.com)? - I previously worked at a similar company as a business analyst and hence the question. I was able to answer this based on the work I had done there.
2. Let's say you have a categorical column with 500 categories. How would you tackle this? - I answered that we can use Catboost as it uses the catboost target encoder which would help convert the categorical values into numerical values rather than going for one hot encoding. He then mentioned that he wants to use linear regression so I said that we can use target encoding methods like James Stein encoder or Catboost encoder(preferred as it tackles target leakage). Was my answer right or is there some other way because he didn't seem 100% convinced with it?
3. How would you check the weight of each feature in a decision tree? - I said that we can look at the feature importance of each feature. He then asked if a feature importance of 100 means the feature's influence on the target is 100? To which I replied that you can see the SHAP values to understand the influence of a feature on the target but honestly I haven't researched enough on it to comment further.
4. Can I use K Means with categorical data? - You can use one hot encoding to convert categorical data to numerical but using K Means with Euclidian distance on binary columns does not make sense so I would use K Modes rather than K Means for categorical data
5. How do I choose the number of clusters for K Means? - use elbow method or silhouette score and I explained both the methods
6. Let's say I use silhouette analysis on a customer segmentation exercise and get K=30 as optimal number of clusters. I can't show 30 clusters to the business so what do I do now? - I said that generally for customer segmentation we would need business input as well so what is a practical number of segments according to the business? He replied 5-10 so I said that well out of the 5-10 clusters whichever has the highest silhouette score should be chosen. But I don't know if this is the right answer?
7. Difference b/w K Means and K modes? - I just said that for categorical data we use K Modes because finding the mode of a particular category is more accurate and makes more sense rather than converting the category to binary values and using a distance algo like K Means.
8. How would you perform customer segmentation on OTT platforms? - I panicked on this one honestly and said age, gender, nationality and probably genre of shows, do they watch shows completely, how long have they been a member on the OTT platform (Yes ik some of these don't make sense but like i said i PANCIKED)
9. Do you think the above mentioned factors are a good representative of the customer lifetime value? - Uhh no idea what customer life time value means so I just winged this one
10. Can you have more than one independent variable in ARIMA? - I answered yes cause I do vaguely remember coming across this but I am not 100% sure.
11. What is the difference b/w ARIMA and ARIMAX? - ARIMAX is ARIMA but also has exogenous variables which help identify surges like holidays.
12. Would you use ARIMA or Prophet for time series? - I read an article that says a properly tuned SARIMA would outperform Prophet so i answered the same
13. How would you tune ARIMA? - by finding the best parameter values for p,d,q
14. What are p,d,q in ARIMA? - (I forgot what they represent but I tried to answer from whatever I could recall ) p=no. of previous lags to consider, q= i forgot, d = difference(?)
15. What exactly is ""d""? - I said that it represents the seasonality pattern but I now realize that seasonality is in SARIMA and not ARIMA. (ugh)
16. Can you pass non - stationary data to ARIMA? - No, because the assumption of TS is that data is stationary with constant mean and variance as it will assume the same patterns for future values as well
17. How do we check if data is stationary? - By plotting it first but more accurate way is to use Dickey Fuller test to confirm it
18. How do I choose which 10 new hotels to onboard on [Booking.com](https://Booking.com)? - I said that we can look at the number of bookings, location, accessibility( metro, bus), is it near a tourist spot, reviews, stars.
19. What if my model has recommended that all the 10 new hotels that we should onboard should be from the same area X? How do I add a constraint to fix this? - I don't even know what topic this question is from but I said maybe you can modify the cost function by adding a variable which will penalize the cost function based on the number of hotels it suggests that belong to the same area or maybe we can add constraints to the cost function
20. If I add constraints to the cost function then it becomes a non linear optimization problem so how would you use linear programming to solve it? - I had no idea lol
21. What is the difference b/w segmentation and clustering? - I answered that segmentation is a use case of clustering but apparently the interviewer said that clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm while segmentation is a supervised learning algorithm.
22. Have you created a data pipeline before? - Nope

&#x200B;

**Edit:**Thank you so much for the comments, upvotes and awards! I really appreciate the feedback as well! I am honestly relieved to hear that such interviews aren't the norm since it was really intense given I am not really that experienced.

Since I got a few questions around the job requirements, I have put the technical requirements below but I did NOT have ALL of these so I really don't know on what basis they shortlisted my cv.

y6w5ab,"[UNHINGED RANT] It’s kind of annoying to see that, in general, most data-related spaces are flush with “how do I get a job” and comparatively little discussion around the actual topic","The `data \w+` gold rush has been a blessing and a curse, blessing in that many of us are getting filthy rich off it, curse in that many (frankly unskilled) people see the job market and think “wow I gotta get me a piece of that” and proceed to bombard every specialist board with mentorship requests and e-begging for a crumb of interview. 

Frankly I wouldn’t mind this if the people asking had done some cursory research beforehand and asked politely, but it seems like every jerkoff who’s caught a whiff of an Excel spreadsheet thinks they can land a FAANG job overnight and, instead of looking on Google for “how to data job pls to help” and seeing the ten trillion useless Medium articles made by the endless morons trying to resume pad and slip their jimmy into an Amazon L3 role that would tell them practically everything they need to know (even if by and large anything posted on Medium is worthless) they choose to pepper subs like /r/dataengineering, /r/dataanalysis, and this one with the same “how to data job please give me six figures” - it’s like asking /r/personalfinance “help how do I own a bank account” repeated for every hapless schmuck who’s been hiding their Benjamins in granny’s cookie tin for the last sixteen years of their childhood. 

Not even getting into the fact that doing basic research on the topic at hand is probably *the* fundamental skill for any data-*whatever* role, what’s even funnier is that I’d hazard a guess that most of us who *actually work in the industry* have better things to do during the day, so the people answering questions are probably majority kids trying to get their first data-whatever job - blind leading the blind all over again.

1bj9cvc,A data scientist got caught lying about their project work and past experience during interview today,"I was part of an interview panel for a staff data science role. The candidate had written a really impressive resume with lots of domain specific project work experience about creating and deploying cutting-edge ML products. They had even mentioned the ROI in millions of dollars. The candidate started talking endlessly about the ML models they had built, the cloud platforms they'd used to deploy, etc. But then, when other panelists dug in, the candidate could not answer some domain specific questions they had claimed extensive experience for. So it was just like any other interview.

One panelist wasn't convinced by the resume though. Turns out this panelist had been a consultant at the company where the candidate had worked previously, and had many acquaintances from there on LinkedIn as well. She texted one of them asking if the claims the candidate was making were true. According to this acquaintance, the candidate was not even part of the projects they'd mentioned on the resume, and the ROI numbers were all made up. Turns out the project team had once given a demo to the candidate's team on how to use their ML product.

When the panelist shared this information with others on the panel, the candidate was rejected and a feedback was sent to the HR saying the candidate had faked their work experience.

This isn't the first time I've come across people ""plagiarizing"" (for the lack of a better word) others' project works as their's during interview and in resumes. But this incident was wild. But do you think a deserving and more eligible candidate misses an opportunity everytime a fake resume lands at your desk? Should HR do a better job filtering resumes?

Edit 1: Some have asked if she knew the whole company. Obviously not, even though its not a big company. But the person she connected with knew about the project the candidate had mentioned in the resume. All she asked was whether the candidate was related to the project or not. Also, the candidate had already resigned from the company, signed NOC for background checks, and was a immediate joiner, which is one of the reasons why they were shortlisted by the HR. 

Edit 2: My field of work requires good amount of domain knowledge, at least at the Staff/Senior role, who're supposed to lead a team. It's still a gamble nevertheless, irrespective of who is hired, and most hiring managers know it pretty well. They just like to derisk as much as they can so that the team does not suffer. As I said the candidate's interview was just like any other interview except for the fact that they got caught. Had they not gone overboard with exxagerating their  experience, the situation would be much different.",775,338,OverratedDataScience,2024-03-20 09:26:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bj9cvc/a_data_scientist_got_caught_lying_about_their/,0,datascience

mimpre,"Against the negativity here, I just received my $200k salary offer in just 2 years (even in this economy)","Few months ago, I wrote in this thread (with an older account) about how I think some Data Scientists are getting underpaid and negotiation is an important skill during interviews as much as ML frameworks. It was meant to be a message to uplift all of us into better career development.

But when I wrote that my first job as a Data Scientist was making $150k a year and that we can easily make $200k with upgraded skills, experience and right negotiation, people here laughed at me -- said that I was trolling and that kind of salary was insane. I told them this is the average in the Bay Area, but they said that even seniors don't make this kind of salary.

Well 2 years later, I have just secured a $200k salary, $170k in base and $30 in yearly bonus (not including RSU). This is for a Data Scientist in ML role at a company in SF (not well known, but a stable company). I eventually settled for another company with far less salary but far better stock potential. But still.

Given that I proved my initial point, I want to say few additional points of affirmation.

1. Don't undersell yourself. Know your value and worth and stick to it with confidence even in this terrible economy.
2. If you can impress the hiring manager and the senior management during interviews, they're more than happy to work with your professed worth (if not in salary, then in bonus, stocks, etc.). Otherwise, they will lowball you. This requires a refined skill in both communication and technical chops
3. Know how to play the political game during interview cycle. Master the negotiation tactics. Know how to bluff. Too many tech folks don't like to do this and think that they can keep their heads down and work hard, and their accomplishments will be naturally rewarded by some supernatural force. That's rarely the case. Data and Software folks are not immune to necessities of nuanced and skillful communication.

BTW, I don't have FANG-level experience. My first company 2 years ago was a mid-sized startup most people haven't heard of.",762,338,None,2021-04-02 15:31:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mimpre/against_the_negativity_here_i_just_received_my/,0,datascience
ldvl72,Is anybody else here trying to actively push back against the data science hype?,"So I'd expected the hype to die off by now, but if anything it's getting worse. Are there any groups out there actively pushing back against the ridiculous hype?

I've worked as a data scientist for 5+ years now, and have recently been looking for a new position. I'm honestly shocked at how some of the interviewers seem to view a data science job as little more than an extended Kaggle competition.

A few days ago, during an interview, I was told ""We want to build a neural network"" - I've started really pushing back in interviews. My response was along the lines: you don't need a neural network, Jesus you don't have any infrastructure and your data is beyond shite (all said politely in a non-condescending way, just paraphrasing here!).

I went on to talk about the value they CAN get out of ML and how we could build up to NN. I laid out a road map: Let's identify what problems your business is trying to solve (hint might not even need ML), eventually scope and translate those business problems into ML projects, start identifying ways in which we can improve your data quality, start building up some infrastructure, and for the love of god start automating processes because clearly I will not be processing all your data by hand. Update: Some people seem to think I did this in a rude way: guys I was professional at all times. I'm paraphrasing with a little dramatic flair - don't take it verbatim.

To my surprise, people gloss over at this point. They really were not interested in hearing about how one would go about project managing large data science problems. Or hearing about my experience in DS project management. They just wanted to hear buss words and know whether I knew particular syntax. They were even more baffled when I told them I have to look up half the syntax, because I automate most of the low-level stuff - as I'm sure most of us do. There seems to be such a disconnect here. It just baffles me. Employers seem to have quite a warped view of day-to-day life as a data scientist.

So is anybody else here trying to push back against the data science hype at work etc? If so, how? And if many of us are doing this then why is the hype not dialling back? Why have companies not matured.",759,280,Least_Curious_Crab,2021-02-06 11:00:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ldvl72/is_anybody_else_here_trying_to_actively_push_back/,0,datascience

13o7m3d,Anyone else been mildly horrified once they dive into the company's data?,"I'm a few months into my first job as a data analyst at a mobile gaming company. We make freemium games where users can play for awhile until they run out of coins/energy then have to wait varying amounts of time, like ""You're out of coins. Wait 10 minutes for new coins, or you can buy 100 coins now for $12.99.""

So I don't know what I was expecting, but the first time I saw how much money some people spend on these games I felt like I was going to throw up. Most people never make a purchase. But some people spend insane amounts of money. Like upsetting amounts of money.

There's one lady in Ohio who spent so much money that her purchases alone could pay for the salaries of our entire engineering department. And I guess they did?

There's no scenario in which it would make sense for her to spend that much money on a mobile game. Genuinely I'm like, the only way I would not feel bad for this lady is if she's using a stolen credit card and fucking around because it's not really her money.

Anyone else ever seen things like this while working as a data analyst?

\*Edit: Interesting that the comment section has both people saying-

1. Of course the numbers are that high; ""whales"" spend a lot of money on mobile games.
2. The numbers can't possibly be that high; it must be money laundering or pipeline failures.

Both made me feel oddly validated though, so thank you.",733,232,Commercial-Fox6222,2023-05-21 21:56:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/13o7m3d/anyone_else_been_mildly_horrified_once_they_dive/,0,datascience

713hnw,How I went from no coding or machine learning experience to data scientist job offer in 20 months. [x-post r/learnprogramming],"TL;DR: learned a buncha shit in 20 months with no prior anything-related experience, got job as data scientist

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


Edit: Seems like this was removed from r/learnprogramming. Trying to direct all the PMs to come here

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


First, I want to thank the entire reddit community because without this place I wouldn’t have went down the rabbit hole that is self-learning, job searching, and negotiation. 

&nbsp;


Second, just to list out my background so people know where I started and how I got here: I graduated in 2013 with a bachelor’s in civil engineering (useless in this case) and again in 2015 with a master’s in operations research (much more useful, namewise at least) both from the same top school. The name of the school and the operations research degree opened up quite a few doors in the beginning of my (2-year) career, and definitely was a factor in getting an interview, but had nothing to do directly with what was needed for the Data Science job. This is because that offer was contingent on a programming skillset and specific data science problem-solving abilities, of which I had none right after graduation.

&nbsp;

The most useful advice to keep in mind: keep trying, keep learning, don’t be afraid to switch jobs when you’re bored or it’s not what you want, continuously look for new opportunities, and always negotiate. I went from a 47k job where I lasted only 4 months, to a 65k job where I lasted just under a year, to a 90k job where I stayed 10 months, to my new job at 115k. All in under 2 and a half years. Strap yourself in, this will be long!


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Step 1:**


Get your first real job out of college, realize how much you loathe it, feel entitled because they’re not paying you for your amazing theoretical prowess that isn’t really useful, realize that you were meant to do much more cool shit, and convince yourself that you need a higher paying job.


My first job out of grad school lasted 4 months. It was an analyst title, which I thought was awesome because I had no idea what analysts do, but it was mostly bitchwork and data entry. The one upside was that my boss mentioned a pivot table once, and I googled it, so I finally learned what it was. But I still figured I was too smart for this shit so I looked for other jobs because I needed something to challenge me.


Congrats, you now have the drive to get your ass to a better role!


&nbsp;


**Step 2:**


I got into the adtech industry after my 4-month stint, they liked me because of that pivot table thing I learned to do /s. This is where the data science itch began, but I knew I wouldn’t be satisfied in the long run. As pompous as it is to keep saying I was too smart for this shit, I was. I just needed the tools to show that.


The amount of data that lives in the industry is insane, and it’s always good to mention how much data you’ve worked with. This place is where you earn your SQL, Excel, and Tableau medals. You edit some dashboards, you pivot and slice data, you don’t necessarily write your own complex queries from scratch but you know how they look like and know what joins do.


By no means was I going to do any advanced stuff at work so I needed to start doing it on my own if I wanted to grow. In my time at this job (after work but also during work. Use your down time wisely!), I took MIT’s Intro to Comp Sci with Python, Edx’s Analytics Edge, and Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning. This set up the foundation but since they were all intro courses, I couldn’t apply the knowledge. There were still a bunch of missing pieces.


But! At least I got started. Towards the end of my time there I found rmotr.com through reddit. I finished the advanced python programming course, which was incredibly difficult for me at the time because of the knowledge density and intensity. I highly recommend it if you want to learn more advanced python methodologies and applications, and also if you’re leaning towards the development side.


&nbsp;


**Step 3:**


I left my last company of a few thousand people, where everything was essentially fully established, and moved to a smaller company of 100ish people. There was more opportunity to build and own projects here, and it’s where I earned my dev, analytics, and machine learning medals. This is where classes will continue to aid in your learning, but where google and stackoverflow will help you actually BUILD cool shit. You will have thousands of questions the classes won’t be able to answer, so your searching skills will greatly improve in this time.


During my time here I completed Coursera UMichigan’s Intro to Data Science with Python. I completed it relatively quickly and from what I recall, it wasn’t too challenging. 


After that course, I stumbled on Udemy and completed Jose Portilla’s Python for Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp, which was a turning point from knowledge to application. This class is a must. It’s how I learned to neatly organize my data frames, manipulate them very easily, and, thanks to google and stackoverflow, how to get all that data into csv and excel sheets so I can send them to people. It doesn’t sound like much, but data organization and manipulation was the #1 worthwhile skill I learned. It’s also where I learned to implement all machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, and a bit of deep learning. There wasn’t much theory behind it, which was perfectly fine, because I was going for 100% application.


This is also where I took advantage of the training reimbursement at work- I kept buying courses and it was free! During this time I also completed Stanford’s Statistical Learning course on their Lagunita platform (good for knowledge base), the first three courses of Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (it was a breeze because it was in python and I had a deep understanding of dataframes by this time, also very good for knowledge base and algorithm implementation from scratch), and another Udemy class from Jose Salvatierra called the Complete PostgreSQL and Python Developer Course- also a game changer. It was the first course I had on clean python code for software development. The way he thinks is outstanding and I highly recommend it.


&nbsp;


**Step 4: Resume Building and Linkedin**


There are articles out there that can explain this a lot better than I can, but here were my steps to have my resume and Linkedin Ready:


*Resume*


1.	Kept the resume to one page, had it look more modern, sleek, and fresh (even had dark grey and blue colors) 

2.	Under my name, listed my email, number, github, and linkedin across the entire width of the page


3.	Recent work experience on top. Descriptions included what technology I used (python, impala, etc.) to do something (built multiple scrapers, python notebooks, automated reporting, etc.) and the effect (saved hours of manual work for account managers, increased revenue day over day by X, etc). This can be easily remembered by saying I used X to do Y with the Z results.


Note: Not all of my descriptions had results. My last listed job on my resume only had the support work I did- I supported accounts totaling X revenue monthly, partook in meetings with clients, etc. Not every task has a quantifiable outcome but it’s nice to throw some numbers in there when you can.


4.	I read in some places that no one would care about this, but I did it anyway, and listed all courses and bootcamps I had finished by that time, which was around 8. While I had some projects I had done at work I could speak to, I wanted them to know that I was really dedicated to learning everything I could about the field. And it worked!

5.	Below that was my education- both degrees listed without GPAs


6.	And lastly, active interests. Maybe old-school corporations don’t care for things like this, but for start-uppy tech companies that are in a growth stage, I figured they’d like to see my what I do on the side. I’ve been competitively dancing for almost a decade and weightlifting for more than that, so if being a dancing weightlifting engineering-background guy makes me seem more unique, I’m going for it. Whatever makes you stick out!

*Linkedin*

1.	Professional-looking photo. Doesn’t have to be professional, just professional-looking.

2.	Fill out everything LinkedIn asks you to fill out so you can be an all-star and appear in more searches. The summary should include a shitload of keywords that relate to what you’ve done and what you want to do. Automation, analytics, machine learning, python, SQL, noSQL, MS-SQL, throw all that shit in there.


3.	I only filled out the description for my most recent job because that’s where I actually did cool shit. I put a lot more detail here in LinkedIn than I did on my resume. Then I listed the 3-4 jobs I had before that, no description

4.	Put all my certifications from the courses I took with links


5.	Put my education, obvs

6.	The rest…eh. Doesn’t really matter.


&nbsp;


**Step 5: Job Search**


So you have your nice and shiny resume ready, and your LinkedIn set to go. This is where the entirety of your hard work will be rewarded. How badly do you want this job?


I stopped using indeed, monster, etc. a long while ago. 


The single tool I used was and still is Glassdoor. Download a PDF copy of your resume to your phone or a cloud drive, search on Glassdoor ON THE DAILY. Keep saved searches ready to go- “junior data scientist”, “data scientist”, “senior analytics”, “senior data analyst”, “junior machine learning”, “entry data science”, and so on. When you’re on the bus or laundromat or in bed late at night and can’t sleep, look for openings. Filter by the rating you’re willing to take on and apply like mad. I got dozens of applications done just from waiting at the laundromat. All the calls I had after were 100% from Glassdoor applications.


&nbsp;


**Step 6: The initial call**


I’ve had 3 total initial calls from the probably 50 or so applications I sent over the summer (very few openings that didn’t require 5+ years of java and machine learning product dev etc. etc. and largely distributed blah blah where I live).


Here were most of the things I was asked:


•	What tools I used at work 


•	How have I made processes more efficient at work


•	Anything I’ve automated 


•	Largest amount of data I worked with and what was the project and result


•	Why the shift from the current job


•	How much I know about their company and how I’d describe the company so someone else (do your research!)


I had 100% success on my initial calls. Each time mentioned some sort of python, automated scripts (simply by using windows task scheduler and batch file- thanks to google search!), and a data manipulation project (highest I’ve had is a few million rows), and I was good to go.


&nbsp;


**Step 7: The data exercise**


From those 3 initial calls, I had 2 exercises sent via email and one via Codility.


The first exercise was SQL and visualization heavy. I was given a SQLite database to work from and had to alter tables to feed into other tables to aggregate other metrics and so on. Once that was done, I had to use the resulting tables to do some visualizations and inference.


Did I know how to do most of what they asked? Hell no. I had google and stackoverflow open for every little detail I didn’t know how to do off the top of my head. The entire thing took about 20-25 hours spread across the week and even when I submitted it didn’t feel complete. I couldn’t afford not to put all my free time into this exercise.


The end result: the hiring manager and team was impressed with the code, but they didn’t vibe with the presentation style of my jupyter notebook and it was very apparent that I lacked the domain knowledge required (this was for a health tech company, and I have no health anything experience). It actually prompted them to re-post with an altered job description requiring domain knowledge. Woo? Regardless, this served as a huge source of validation for me- these senior level members thought my code was good. 


The second exercise was from the company I ultimately accepted. It was 3-4 hours in total to assess business intelligence skills (SQL and visualization). They liked it and I moved on to the in-person, which I’ll go into in the next step.


The last exercise was codility- and while my code “worked”, there was likely some test cases I didn’t account for. Either that or the company got irritated when I said I received an offer and if they could speed up the process. They didn’t follow through.


&nbsp;


**Step 8: The in-person interview**


So you got to this stage! Congrats!


And you’ll be interviewing with 3 VPs, 2 C-level execs, and 2 data scientists. Jesus fuck, you’ve never met this many executives in your whole life.


No need to freak out. This simply validates your hard work. You’ll be meeting with very important people for a very important job, and they think you might be good at it. 


Even if I hadn’t made it past this, I tasted victory.


I did something that may not be recommended by most people: I didn’t prepare for questions they’d ask me, but rather prepared for all the questions I’d ask them. This did two things: I didn’t obsess about what they’d ask me so I was relaxed, and it gave me a lot of chances to show I knew my shit when I asked them a bunch of stuff. Besides, for a data science job, I figured they’d ask questions about how I’d solve some problems they currently have, as opposed to some common questions. And that’s exactly what they did. Not something you can really prepare for the night before, since it’s a way of thinking you’d have to grasp through all the classes and projects and problems you solved at your current job.


IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not advocating ignoring prepping for questions. I did about 30-35 interviews, phone and in person, before my current job so I had a lot of learning experience. I already had a more natural-feeling response for most questions. And if you really were into your projects at your current job, you’ll know what you did inside out, so it’s easier to talk about it on the spot. But by all means, if you don’t have much interview experience, prepare and practice!


Here are my notes from after the interviews, including what was asked and how I answered, and what I asked:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP of Data Science**

&nbsp;

•	*Notice any hiccup in your exercise?* I debated with him on the accuracy of a single statement in the exercise, assuring him that since I used a Hadoop-based query engine and they used AWS, my method worked every time I used it. I never checked whether he or I was right because afterwards I started thinking he was right and didn’t want to feel like an idiot. But we moved on rather quickly.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you implement typo detection?* I gave a convoluted response but put simply, some distance index between words. As in, how many changes would it take to get to the word we may want. He liked the answer because it’s what he was thinking too.

&nbsp;

•	*How’s your style of explaining things to people?* Very logical step-by-step process with the goal of weaning people off needing me. I’d explain it to them completely, then next time leave a few steps missing and ask if they’d remember, then eventually just give them a step or two.

&nbsp;

•	*What’s something you want to be better at?* Being more personable when explaining technical terms to non-tech people

&nbsp;

Then I went crazy with a ton of questions about what projects they’re working on, what’s the first thing I’d be working on, the challenges they have currently, how do they interact with the sales team, and so on.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP Tech**

&nbsp;

•	*So, data! Tell me about it.* I told him that I love it, I’m excited by it, and I wana get better at it.

&nbsp;

•	*What as a process you made more efficient at work.* Created an automated process using a batch file to run python script via task scheduler. It scrapes an internal web tool and creates reporting that otherwise doesn’t exist, which saves hours for the account managers weekly.

&nbsp;

•	*So you aimed towards a process that would essentially take something that’s not working too well, fix it, and productionalize it?* Why yes, yes indeed.

&nbsp;

•	*So that kind of sounds like a software development mentality.* Absolutely, and eventually after I have a lot of exposure to the research side of data science I’d like to get more into a machine learning engineering role to build everything out.

&nbsp;

•	*Cool man!*

&nbsp;

He probably liked that I wasn’t purely analytics, but also built tools to solve problems not related to data science.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**COO, President** 


•	*What are areas do you think you need development in?* Being more on the business side of things, as I tend to like delving deep into my code to make things work I sometimes get delayed info of the overall business health.

&nbsp;

•	*Do you have any entrepreneurial experience?* I said nope, to which he responded with “Nothing? Not even selling lemonade?”. Then it jogged my memory of when I tried to sell yugioh and pokemon cards at the pool when I was young, with my binder of sheets with prices too high so no one would buy. He had a laugh and said it was a good answer because the simple experience in learning the prices were too high was a lesson.

&nbsp;

•	*What are you looking for?* Something challenging, where I won’t be just a SQL monkey (this term was thrown around by a lot of the team, so I kept repeating it and made references to who mentioned it to show that I’m paying attention), where there will be big issues to solve across the company, and a place where I’d be doing something meaningful. In this case, it was helping local businesses thrive, and I’m all for that. I’m coming from an adtech background, so the emphasis was very clear on the “finding meaning” part.

&nbsp;

•	*If that's the case, why this company?* I liked that they were VERY fast with their interview process. I told him that and that it shows a lot about the company and how much they care to get things done. 

&nbsp;

•	*What was your proudest moment?* Told him about the first time I built a tool that helped the business, which was at my current company. The year or so of effort learning python and databases and manipulating dataframes led to a really cool scraping project that now seems rather novice, but I couldn’t contain my excitement when I accomplished it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Data Scientists**


Sit and chat. I asked them questions about how they like it there, what projects they worked on, etc. Very laid back.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**VP Marketing (first form)**


This was the one guy who really grilled me with problem solving questions. 

&nbsp;

•	*Why did google decide to build out their own browser?* This is where my background in adtech helped. I listed almost everything I could about user data, selling to advertisers, tracking users, etc. He thought those were good answers, but it wasn’t what he was looking for. He asked me the next leading question.

&nbsp;

•	*What was so good about chrome compared to IE?* I stumbled on this since I never could really compare it fully to internet explorer since I never used IE, I just knew people said it sucked. With some guidance I answered correctly: faster load times.

&nbsp;

•	*And what does that mean?* I took a few seconds of thought and answered correctly, that google wants their search pages to load faster.

&nbsp;

From there, he pulled some stats about google CPC and rates from another country and asked me how much would google make in capturing a certain percent of the internet explorer user market. My process was correct, but the multiplication was off in the end. A bit embarrassing, but at least I owned it and made some jokes about division by hand. Got the correct answer after.


That concluded the first in-person interview. Got called for another in-person and I was shitting myself because I thought maybe they didn’t get enough information. I was much more nervous for this one, but once the interviews started I was calm and confident.

&nbsp;

**CMO** 

&nbsp;

•	*What are some of areas that you need development in?* Same as I said before- business side things.

&nbsp;

•	*Why the short tenure in your old jobs (4 months, 12 months, 9 months)?* THIS is where you have to show yourself as the ever-growing, constant-learning, autodidact with insatiable appetite to learn. I told him I learn on my own outside of work, I apply that knowledge to build cool shit, and that I outgrow my positions very quickly so I needed something more challenging. I backed it up with the projects I completed.

&nbsp;

•	*What'll be the biggest challenge you'll face here?* Data Science team structure- sprints, prioritizing the right projects, etc. Haven’t experienced it before so I’d have to learn how to operate within that structure.

&nbsp;

•	*What would your current boss say about you?* I explained that I have sort of two bosses, one tech and one nontech. The tech one would say I can take an idea and run with it to build a tool. The nontech would say I’m very helpful and available asap when he needs me.

&nbsp;

•	*What would they say you need improvement on?* Nontech boss- business side of things. Tech boss- get more into the details of adtech, like which scripts are executed on the page, how it relates to different servers, etc.

&nbsp;

•	*What would your last boss say about you?* Always learning on the job

&nbsp;

•	*What's one example of when you thought outside the box?* Gave example of how the data engineering team was backed up and couldn’t ingest some third party data, so I used python to ingest the data 6-8 weeks before they could do it. I also explained that while the process was essentially the same (extract, transform, load) I thought outside the box by not relying on the team assigned with the task and figured out my own way to do it. He thought that was an excellent example.

&nbsp;

•	*What was your proudest moment?* Same answer as before

&nbsp;

•	*Why the move?* Current company is pivoting, has been for 8 months but not much to show for it, a lot of senior leadership is exiting, not confident in the direction it’s taking, so figured this would be a great time to make a change.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you describe your old bosses?* Last job- was first a coworker that was promoted to my boss. She was very kind, figuring out how to manage, but never lost sight of being compassionate and fighting for her team. Wonderful overall. Current job- nontech boss is very hands off since he doesn’t know the details of what I do, but gives good overall ideas. With tech boss, we work together constantly on data tasks or ideas for new tools to build. Very logical and unemotional at work, similar to me.

&nbsp;

After, I asked about what success looks like in the role and what were the biggest challenges facing his department.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP Marketing (final form)**


Here he was again! Back with more questions to grill me. I really liked the guy because he did his due diligence, and it was fun because the questions made my brain’s gears go overdrive.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you go about seeing if users ordering from more than one location is profitable?* I responded with a very convoluted explanation for A/B test, which he said was good, then asked how to do it without the ability to do A/B test using data we already have. Was able to eventually tell him something along the lines of a time series analysis involving control groups.

&nbsp;

•	*Walk me through how you'll implement A/B test.* Told him the basics, but that I haven’t done it in practice. Couldn’t answer his question about how long it should run for so I told him straight up, and he was okay with it.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you go about determining the optimal number of recommendations to show on the app for each geographical type?* Basic group-bys by geo and success rate for each number of recommendations shown.

&nbsp;

•	*What is logistic regression?* At this point I had just finished one of Andrew Ng’s deep learning course, where you code a logistic regression from scratch, so I did a little showboating here with how much I knew =D

&nbsp;

•	*Take me through the process of how you got into machine learning.* I told him basically what I’ve described here- that I felt useless after my master’s, needed to not be left behind in the machine learning revolution, went crazy from day one and here I am.

&nbsp;

I asked him:


•	What are the projects I'll work on in the first month?


•	You worked at other huge and established companies, so why here and what makes you come back everyday?


And! I give you the absolute best question to ask:


•	“You’ve had the most opportunity to get to know me and my skillset. I’d like to know if you had any reservations about my qualifications as a candidate so we can discuss and take care of any concerns.”


Boom! And just like that, I knew how impressed he was and that the only reservation was my short experience, but that I more than made up for it with my passion and drive. He almost didn’t want to say my lack of experience was a concern and looked very hesitant, I guess in fear of having me being like “peace!”


And that was that!


&nbsp;


**Step 9: Wait forever and get paranoid**


Title says it all. It’s hard to wait and wait especially when you felt like you did really well, and especially when the interviewing process took 3 weeks but the decision process takes another 3 weeks. My advice is simply keep applying to other places, don’t take your foot off the pedal, and continue learning/building things. I managed to finish another 2 courses from the time of the first interview to the offer, and even built my own small personal website. Don’t let up!


&nbsp;


**Step 10: Negotiate**


I’ll leave it to you to gather more advice on negotiating and how to go about it, but my general advice is to always negotiate. Whether the market value is higher than the offer (I’m not a fan of this explanation but I’ve never had to use it), or you suddenly feel that the responsibilities are worth more or, as in my case, you realize they don’t offer benefits you thought would be offered, then NEGOTIATE. It can be by phone or email, just do it. It’s uncomfortable, you’ll question your decision every second of the day for what seems like forever, you think they’ll rescind the offer and get someone cheaper. Just relax. It’s business. It’s part of showing your skills by not leaving money on the table. With a role as specialized as this where there is a lot of demand, you have the upper hand if you’ve already proved yourself. I got a nice bump at my current job and at the new data science job by asking for more. I’ll leave you this fantastic link that helped with a changing mindset:


http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

And that’s a wrap! A quick summary of the most important lessons I learned in this journey:


-	You don’t have to get an expensive Data Science degree or go to an expensive bootcamp. Everything is literally available for free somewhere online, and more structured resources are available at very low cost (Udemy and their $10 specials!)


-	Glassdoor is the most important app in this process. Download it, keep a fresh copy of your resume on your phone, and send out apps during your commute, at the laundromat, while in bed on a lazy Saturday, etc. It’s almost effortless


-	Absorb everything you can. A lot of it won’t stick, but a lot of it will.


-	Learning demands consistency. 10 hours of study spread across 2 weeks is much better than 10 hours you did that one weekend 2 weeks ago.


-	USE what you learn somehow- if you picked up python, google how to scrape the web, or how to automate sending files via email, or how to connect to a certain database. Make a project out of it, even a mini-project that you can speak about later. Google will show you the way! Optimizing processes is sexy and it was the most frequently asked question in this job search. 


-	In case you couldn’t tell, google and stackoverflow were lifesavers


-	Talk is cheap. A lot of people I know talk about taking classes and how excited they are. A year later they’re in the same place. Learn it, use it, and continue learning. Spend less time talking about how you’re gonna do something and work towards getting it done.


-	You’ll stumble through a lot of material- and that’s okay. Not everything is connected in the beginning, and a lot of it will feel like wasted effort. Keep going! You’ll reach the “aha!” moment when everything clicks and you “get it”. It might take a year and a half, but think about what would have happened if you started a year and a half ago?


-	Adding to the last point, it’s hard to know where to start and where to go. I’ll summarize a cheap quick start guide for data science below if you’re lost!


-	Get ready to make sacrifices. On average it was 3-4 hours daily, everyday, before or after work, and sometimes 6 hours on each of the weekend days. And this isn’t counting the coding I did during work to make things more efficient, which is at least another 3-4 hours per workday. 


-	I did take about 6-8 weeks off in total throughout the whole process though. You’ll burn out sometimes, and that’s okay! If you’re as driven and passionate as I was, you’ll come back to it weeks later, maybe even a month.


-	Lastly, reddit is a place of vast knowledge of the field. Use it, go to r/learnprogramming or r/datascience or r/jobs or r/personalfinance. There will be questions and topics covering a lot of what I covered here.

**Quick start guide for data science:**


(in no particular order)


-	Introduction to Computer Science with Python from Edx.org


-	Either:


o	Andrew Ng’s Machine learning via coursera (not in python, but teaches you to know the matrix manipulation fundamentals)


o	Statistical Learning via Stanford Lagunita (more theory than programming understanding, but covers similar concepts, and introduces R which is also a good tool)


-	Python Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp via Udemy
Again, this is just to get started. Google and stackoverflow will take you to the next level and other courses will fill the knowledge gaps.

14k6qt5,A small rant - The quality of data analysts / scientists,"I work for a mid size company as a manager and generally take a couple of interviews each week, I am frankly exasperated by the shockingly little knowledge even for folks who claim to have worked in the area for years and years.

&#x200B;

1. People would write stuff like LSTM , NN , XGBoost etc. on their resumes but have zero idea of what a linear regression is or what p-values represent. In the last 10-20 interviews I took, not a single one could answer why we use the value of 0.05 as a cut-off (Spoiler - I would accept literally any answer ranging from defending the 0.05 value to just saying that it's random.)
2.  Shocking logical skills, I tend to assume that people in this field would be at least somewhat competent in maths/logic, apparently not - close to half the interviewed folks can't tell me how many cubes of side 1 cm do I need to create one of side 5 cm.
3. Communication is exhausting - the words ""explain/describe **briefly**"" apparently doesn't mean shit - I must hear a story from their birth to the end of the universe if I accidently ask an open ended question.
4. Powerpoint creation / creating synergy between teams doing data work is not data science - please don't waste people's time if that's what you have worked on unless you are trying to switch career paths and are willing to start at the bottom.
5. Everyone claims that they know ""**advanced excel**"" , knowing how to open an excel sheet and apply =SUM(?:?) is not advanced excel - you better be aware of stuff like offset / lookups  / array formulas / user created functions / named ranges etc. if you claim to be advanced.
6. There's a massive problem of not understanding the ""**why?**"" about anything - why did you replace your missing values with the medians and not the mean? Why do you use the elbow method for detecting the amount of clusters? What does a scatter plot tell you (hint - In any real world data it doesn't tell you shit - I will fight anyone who claims otherwise.) - they know how to write the code for it, but have absolutely zero idea what's going on under the hood.

There are many other frustrating things out there but I just had to get this out quickly having done 5 interviews in the last 5 days and wasting 5 hours of my life that I will never get back.

jvwgq3,A little advice after 15 years in this field as an industry practitioner and academic.,"I noticed an inflow of people disappointed that the field is not what they thought it would be employment wise.

Correct me if I'm wrong but my overall feeling is that you are not reaping the rewards your masters/bootcamp/online course promised. You are not turning down people left and right asking for your services. And thus, you feel like the field is not what you wanted.

A bit of my background I started doing ""data science"" back in 2005, I have a Masters and a PhD on applied Machine Learning. I've done consulting in AI for NTT Japan (largest IT company in the country), done 2 postdocs in top 20 Universities, both of them on applied AI to Science. Consulting to the largest companies in LatAm, and currently on charge of 10+ ML/DataScience experts as ML Director as one of the Largest Banks in LatAm by assets.

* 1st Advice. If you are in it for the money, better invest wisely.

**If you have no experience**. Don't spend 400 usd in 400 little Udemy classes, or a Datacamp subscription, etc. Spend big and go to a big name school to do a Masters, there are plenty of funding options. Believe me, even if you learn the same thing, the fact that your certification/course says MIT instead of DataCamp is my only pointer if you don't have field experience at all. I say it again, this is **IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE.**

* 2nd Advice. Get all the experience you can, even if it's pro bono!

There is nothing like working with real datasets, I couldn't care less if you did all the tutorials on tensorflow or Sklearn using MNIST or Fashion MNIST, guess what, so did the other 40 applicants. But if you were privy to any datasets that few people can access, then I can see some value if your business understanding and capability of deploying ML techniques with data that no one else has seen before.

Sound hard? no, is extremely easy, the fact that there is a shortage of talent is no illusion. Go to a local University and look for researchers that might need to use ML in something, and offer to do that analysis, or only cleaning the data for free. That gives you both experience and opens doors for future employment.

The most interesting datasets I've seen have been in projects that I did for free or very little money.

* 3rd Advice. Learn the business and build yourself a niche.

Again, there is a need for DS and ML practitioners, that is very real, I have 3 open positions right now. But guess what? I won't hire anyone with no Finance or related experience. I need people capable of understanding business terms, and are capable of reading a Cash Flow and an Income Statement. Few applicants really know how to do it or have any interest in how to do it.

I have friend in the oil industry and is the same story all over again, people just want access to a dataset with no interest in learning about oil or extracting processes. 

&#x200B;

Note: Notice that all this advice is to give you all that extras and plus that you will need to get hired, doing a bootcamp or a course is not good enough anymore, you need to differentiate yourself.",718,163,leonoel,2020-11-17 16:52:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/jvwgq3/a_little_advice_after_15_years_in_this_field_as/,0,datascience

iwo0d4,We're data scientists planning a virtual career fair for other data pros during COVID-19. Looking for a job? Looking for help?,"Hi there. This is Wojciech -- I'm a data scientist who has worked with IBM Research + McKinsey. I also ran an YC-backed AI company for 7 years where I've hired over 30 data scientists. My partner and I really want to help the data science community during COVID-19 and beyond.

Thanks to our networks, we've spoken with about a dozen companies looking to hire analysts or scientists... We know there are a lot of folks looking to get hired or start in this field...

**We're thinking of organizing a career fair with companies hiring for data science roles (analysts, data engineers, researchers) and those looking to fill them.** 

We're hoping it'll be particularly helpful or those who often get ghosted by recruiters (*not cool*), or those who apply for lots of jobs and feel like they're in a rut.

Would you be interested in participating? Please DM me and I'd love to learn more about you and get your feedback.

uo589a,Why are companies willing to spend so much on hiring new employees but on retaining them?,"In April 2021, I got a 40% raise. That’s a pretty big raise.

But it didn’t make me feel very good. In fact, it made me realize that I had been leaving money on the table for almost two years.

I would never have got that raise unless I fought for it. Unless I typed the email and stuck my neck out, demanding what I was worth.

The experience taught me an important lesson:

Retention measures (like pay raises) are reactive, not proactive. If your company feels that you're happy there, they won’t pay you more.

In this post, I’m going to tell you that the data back this up, why this is the case, and what you can do about it.

*Before we start: if you like content related to growing your tech career, you might like* [*my newsletter*](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe)*. It's my best content delivered to your inbox once every two weeks. Cheers :)*

**Salary compression**

Salary compression is what happens when companies don’t raise employees' salaries, but pay higher wages to attract new talent.

This imbalance between spending on new hires and existing workers has resulted in historic pay compression, with the gap between the wages of 20- to 24-year-olds (a reliable proxy for new hires) and 25- to 34-year-olds having shrunk to its smallest size in 36 years.

And this actually tends to impact the tech industry more so than others:

https://preview.redd.it/rmujs5im8zy81.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f5900a0d72001ae5fab8303e1ba9062c817369f

TLDR: employers are giving way more money to new hires compared to their existing employees.

This is pretty surprising considering the cost of replacing someone is high. Companies have to:

1. Absorb hiring costs
2. Search in a competitive market for talent
3. Distract team members for another round of interviews
4. Deal with onboarding costs and lack of productivity for first three months of new hire

So why does this happen?

Here are two possible reasons:

**Possible Reason #1: Retention efforts take time**

Solid retention efforts and policies are the type of initiatives that are hard to measure and work over a long period of time, like 5 to 10 years.

And those are often things that can’t be prioritized because of the hypergrowth nature of the tech industry. Investors want to see results now.

Some companies will spend a lot of time and effort to pay the least amount of money they can per role. They take pride in that. It’s much easier to just bring new people in.

Unfortunately, I don’t think it’s the right way to think about the world if you want to be a great company.

**Possible Reason #2: Their career ladder strategy isn't developed**

One of the most common things that happens, especially at high growth startups, is that your workload increases beyond the tasks of your original role, but your salary doesn’t change.

Defining these internal career growth ladders is actually quite time consuming. And so if it’s not been well defined, then there’s no real precedent for you to get a raise.

In these cases, it’s not even the case that the company doesn’t want to give you a raise, it’s just that they haven’t done the work to establish what the next step looks like.

**What this means for you**

First, you need to realize that salary is just one element of your total compensation package. There are a *lot of* factors you can negotiate with that are outside of your base compensation. A quick list:

* Remote work
* Number of holidays
* Professional development opportunities
* Health and wellness benefits
* Bonuses
* Stock options or other long term incentives
* Your hours
* Projects you get to work on

Second, I encourage you to keep in mind that [money isn’t everything](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/motivators-hygiene-factors). It’s pretty cliché but if you’re learning a ton, I don’t think you need to keep money at the forefront of your mind.

For example, at my last company, the first 12 months were great. I was learning something new everyday and my salary didn’t matter too much to me, because I was in “learning” mode.

The 6 months after that, though, were rough. When I stopped enjoying my work, all the focus became about my salary. And when I got the raise that I wanted, I realized that I was staying for the wrong reasons.

So if you think the raise is going to solve your job satisfaction problems, keep in mind that it probably won’t.

But you deserve to get paid what you’re worth. And if you’re not, it’s time to change that.

Here are three principles you should keep in mind when negotiating a raise:

**Principle #1: It's all about the evidence**

Identify your [top two accomplishments](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/howtobragatwork) over the last 6-8 months. Pick ones that have a quantifiable impact. This is your ammunition.

Present this info however you want, but make it as easy as possible for your boss to vouch for you. Don’t make him do any unnecessary work - ideally, it should literally be him having to just forward the evidence you’ve presented (via a deck or a document) to his higher ups and then they discuss it.

Also have a clear salary number in mind. There’s plenty of ways to come up with a number - do research on sites like Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, H1BData, or maybe even reach out to others in the industry.

Once you have a clear number, bump it up by 15-20%.

**Principle #2: Keep your emotions out of it**

*“Anger is our friend. Not a nice friend. Not a gentle friend. But a very, very loyal friend… It will always tell us when we have betrayed ourselves.”* \- Julia Cameron, The Artist’s Way

Anger can be good. But it’s not in your best interests to be angry when negotiating.

Instead, you want to be firm and solution-oriented. That means that you’re not fighting against your boss or the company - you’re on the same team figuring out how you can do your best work.

For example, if you give a number and they come back with one that you’re unhappy with, instead of getting angry you can simply respond: “That doesn’t work for me. I’m curious how you arrived at that number. Can we walk through it?”

When you keep your emotions out of it, you’ll focus on how the promotion benefits **them** first and not you. And that’s what they want to hear.

**Principle #3: Timing matters**

If you have a performance review coming up in 3 months, don’t wait for 2.5 months to bring up your desire for a raise. Start early. Your boss will need time.

Two other tips:

1/ Try bringing this up after you’ve successfully completed a great project. Recency bias is real.

2/ If you’re purely trying to maximize your money, the way to do it is to get a competing offer and ask your current company to match it or go above. But you’ve got to be prepared to leave. High risk, high reward.

\*\*\*

One last thing.

No one is waking up every day thinking, “Is Shikhar happy in his job? Is he appreciated? Is he fairly compensated?”

I owe it to myself to advocate being paid fairly for my work.

As do you. So go make it happen.

EDIT: If you get the paywall, use the link below with similar details:

https://www.wired.com/story/zillow-ibuyer-real-estate/

This is a good lesson for data scientists. Zillow made a huge bet on their housing price prediction algorithm and lost billions in the process (at least 32 Billion in market cap).

Just because your algorithm predicts well in a test environment, doesn't mean other intangible factors can derail it in the real world. In this case, seller's feelings, housing layout, and local market conditions.

My question is, where was the pilot in this? This seems like executives got too eager to use this and pushed it out on a massive scale without getting enough feedback. Also, overall market conditions could have caused some bias here, rewarding poor decision making when prices were skyrocketing over the past year, and now that the market is more saturated, reality is setting in.",703,183,DJAlaskaAndrew,2021-11-18 13:59:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/qwqbxn/zillow_loses_billions_on_house_price_prediction/,0,datascience

I've just spent the last 9 weeks building what I hope is the simplest way to scrape data from a webpage: [Simplescraper](http://simplescraper.io).

All you gotta do is click on the data you want, give it a name and then view results. If all goes well your data is waiting for you to download in csv or Json format. There's also cloud scraping built in for bigger jobs.

There are dozens of web scrapers out there but none of them seem to nail ease of use *and* a good UI. Hopefully it brings value to some of you 🤞.

hipozj,Landed my first full time job today - Data Engineering,"Hello everyone,

I have been browsing this and other related subs (r/cscareerquestionsEU, r/datascience, etc) for a long time now looking for advice on my journey to find a full-time job and our field in general. I graduated from my Master's program (major in ML, from a top tier university in Germany) this year in March and have been looking for full-time positions in the area for about 6 months now. Today I had a Zoom interview with a company (eCommerce) I had been in touch with for the past couple of weeks and about an hour ago, they called me saying they were really impressed and the job is basically mine if I want it. I am absolutely elated.

To give an idea about my job search process if it gives anyone a perspective being in a similar position, I applied for a total of 222 positions in the areas of Data Science, ML Engineering, Data Engineering, and a handful of Software Development positions as well (CV was same for every application and cover letter was modified a little bit depending on the company - in most cases, it was also the same. Perhaps that explains so many straight-up rejections).

**Ghosted:** 118.

**Outright rejections**: 68.

**Rejections after the technical stage**: 14.

**Still in the process** (applied less than 10 days ago and haven't heard): 22.

**Offers**: 2 (the other one is ML Engineer).

&#x200B;

I feel I am a little above average when it comes to programming but I do have a theoretical understanding of ML algorithms (master's helped), so that helped in some interviews. Regarding the choice between the offers, I feel I am gonna go with the Data Engineering one since there is a lot of room to learn new frameworks which I did not experience in academia (PySpark, Airflow, etc.), there is room to turn into a Data Scientist as the project continues and because the location is excellent.

There were a few days where I was really depressed about my rejections (especially when I got one or two emails in the morning) but I made myself resilient by thinking that the rejections don't matter much (especially the ones given without any interview) and kept on learning and applying. If you are in a similar position, keep on going. Things will turn for the better. :)

&#x200B;

kx0ies,"We Need More Data Engineers, Not Data Scientists","Hey all,

I've recently been doing research on the state of the data science/ML hiring market, trying to answer the question of how in-demand different roles really are.

After looking through the job postings for every data-focused YC company since 2012 (\~1400 companies), I learned that today there's a **much** **higher** need for data roles with an engineering focus rather than pure science roles.

Check out the [full analysis if you're interested!](https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/we-need-data-engineers-not-data-scientists/)",692,179,ScienTecht,2021-01-14 06:56:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/kx0ies/we_need_more_data_engineers_not_data_scientists/,0,datascience
gv3i57,"So many people disappointed with their jobs. You need to manage your expectations, especially if you're very junior.","&#x200B;

I keep seeing threads on this forum about how disappointed so many people are with their data science jobs.

&#x200B;

I think expectations need to be managed, in any line of work:

1. **Seniority / juniority**:  When you start as a medical doctor, you won't start by diagnosing Dr. House-like rare, life-threatening conditions straight away. If you join a law firm, you won't start by passionately and single-handedly defending your clients in court like in a John Grisham book. If you join Goldman Sachs as a graduate, you won't start by managing multi-billion trades and investments straight away. **Any job has a certain amount of grunt work, which is greater at the very beginning of your career**. The world is full of bright kids disappointed with their first jobs, wondering: ""did I really study 3/4/5 years to change the colours of a PowerPoint slide?"".
2. **Importance within the organisation**: this varies wildly from place to place but, generally, regardless of the guff HR says, in many organisations there is a clear difference in the food chain between the functions which are seen as generating revenues and those which are seen as support functions. In many places, the sales team (or equivalent) brings home the money, and everyone else is seen as a support function. You don't need to argue with me that this is shortsighted: you need to understand that this attitude is common, need to do your homework on what the culture is like before joining a company, and make your decisions accordingly.
3. **(related to #2): what is the background of the senior people?** If you are a data scientist in a company where most senior executives have some kind of technical background, you are more likely to be appreciated than in a company where the senior guys (it's almost always guys...) are all salespeople who go into sensory shutdown the moment you mention anything more complicated than the times tables.
4. **what are the real needs of the business?** Even in the most enlightened organisation, with the most technical sensible competent open-minded etc etc executives, **there will be more need for boring work than for exciting, cutting-edge work**. For every person that must do proper R&D and brand-new, cutting edge models processes technologies etc, there will need to be many more people that must manage and maintain the existing processes and models, which is important even if less interesting",684,88,MonthyPythonista,2020-06-02 08:32:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gv3i57/so_many_people_disappointed_with_their_jobs_you/,1,datascience

syjt0c,(Hopefully almost) everything you need to know about data science interviews (EU perspective),"So I’ve recently dived into job search again. Hadn’t really interviewed a lot since more than 3 years and well yeah, the market has changed a lot. Have a total of 5 YoE + STEM PhD which means this experience is probably not generalisable, but I hope these insights will be helpful for some. Just wanted to give back because I benefitted a lot from previous posts and resources, and the Data Science hiring process is not standardised, which makes it harder to find good information about companies. In fact I'm sure that the hiring process is not even standardized inside big companies.

# On BigTech

I’d like to provide an overview over the steps of Big Tech companies that recruit for Data Scientist positions in the EU. I will copy this straight from my notes so all of these come from actual interviews. If there’s no salary info it means I didn’t get to discuss it with them because I dropped out of the process for whatever reason before I ended up signing my offer. In total I spoke with around 40 companies and ended up having 3 different offers, went to 6 final round interviews and stopped some processes because I found a great match in the meantime.

**Booking.com**

Salary: €95k + 15pct Bonus

Interviews:

1. Recruiter call
2. Hackerrank test (2 questions, 1 multiple choice, 1 exercise)
3. 2 Technical interviews:
   1. 20 minutes past projects, real case from Booking for solving it,
   2. Second interview: different case, same system
4. Behavorial interview

**Spotify**

Salary: €85-€90k + negotiable bonus

Process:

1. Recruiter call
2. Hiring manager interview, mostly behavorial but there was some exercise on Bayes’ Theorem that involved calculating some probabilities and using conditional + total probability.
3. Technical screening, coding exercise (Python / SQL). SQL was easy but they do ask Leetcode questions!
4. Presentation + Case Study (take home)
5. Modeling exercise
6. Stakeholder interview

**Facebook/Meta (Data Scientist - Product Analytics)**

I lost my notes but the process was very concise! Regardless of the product, their recruitment process was one of the most pleasant ones I’ve had. Also they have TONS of prep material. I think it went down like this:

1. Recruiter call
2. Technical screen SQL, but you can also use Python / pandas. Actually they said they’re flexible so you could probably even ask for doing it in R
3. Product interviews (onsite)

**Zalando**

I did not have any recruiter call, they just sent me an invitation for the tech screen and there would be only 2 steps involved

1. Technical screening with probability brainteaser (Think of dice throwing and expected value of a certain value after N iterations), explaining logistic regression „mathematically“, live coding (in my case implement TF-IDF) and a/b testing case
2. Onsite with 3-4 interviews

**Wolt**

1. Recruiter screen
2. Hiring manager interview, mostly behavioral
3. Take home assignment. This one is BIG, the deadline was 10 days and they wanted an EDA, training & fitting multiple ML models on a classification task, and then also doing a high level presentation for another case without any data
4. Discussion of the take home + technical questions
5. Stakeholder interview

**DoorDash**

1. Recruiter screen
2. Technical screen + Product case. Think of SQL questions in the technical but you can also use R or Python. They ask 4 questions in 30 mins so be quick! Product case is very generic.
3. Onsite interview with mostly product cases and behaviorals

**Delivery Hero**

1. Recruiter interview
2. Hiring manager interview
3. Codility test, SQL + Python
4. Panel interview: 3 people from the team, focus on behavioural
5. Stakeholder interview: largely behavioural
6. Bar raiser interview: this is Amazon style, live coding + technical questions

# Some other mentions:

**Amazon + Uber**

Sorry, they keep ghosting me :D

**Klarna**

Just a hint: they’re hiring as crazy for data science, I got contacted by them but the recruiter didn’t have any positions that would match my level so we didn’t proceed further. I was a bit sad about this because they’re growing, the product is hot and they may IPO soon.

**QuantCo**

Because I have some different 3rd party recruiter in my mailbox every week: They pay very well, I was told the range is up to 230k / y. 140k base + negotiable spread between bonus and equity. They’re not public so I wouldn’t want to sit on their equity. Anyway, I responded twice to that and got ghosted twice from different recruiters. I would recommend ignoring them.

**Revolut**

They contacted me but I decided to not pursue this further because of their horrible reputation and the way their CEO communicates in public.

**Wayfair**

I interviewed with a couple of people who have worked there before as head of something, no one was particularly excited. I applied there once for a senior data analyst position and they sent me an automated 4 hour long codility test. I opened it but decided to drop out of the process.

# On the general salary situation

For senior data science roles outside of big tech I think a reasonable range to end up at is €70k-90k. In big tech you can expect €80-100k base comp + 10-15% bonus / stocks. I’m sure there’s people who can do a lot better but for me this seemed to be my market value. There are some startups I didn’t want to mention here that can pay pretty well because they’re US backed (they acquire a lot recently), but usually their workload is also a lot higher, so it depends how much you value additional money vs WLB.

[levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) is very (!) accurate if the company is big enough for having data there. Should be the case for all big tech companies btw.

# On interview prep

There’s already great content out there!

While I don’t agree with everything here (like working on weekends and being so religious about the prep), I think the JPM top comment summed up how the prep should be done quite well: [https://www.teamblind.com/post/Have-DS-interviews-gotten-harder-in-the-past-few-years-WbYfzXbE](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Have-DS-interviews-gotten-harder-in-the-past-few-years-WbYfzXbE)

I also read this article many times: [https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ox9h2j/two\_months\_of\_virtual\_faangmula\_ds\_interviews/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ox9h2j/two_months_of_virtual_faangmula_ds_interviews/)

I have to say that I started prepping way too late, basically while I was already knee deep into interviewing, but it worked out well anyway.

**SQL:**

Stratascratch is great if you want to practice for a specific company, but Leetcode will prep you more generally imo. I recommend getting a premium for both actually, even though it's expensive. I just took a one-time monthly subscription (be sure to cancel it immediately after booking it as they will just keep charging you).

**Which Leetcode questions to practice:** [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/)

I honestly didn’t see a lot of Leetcode style questions but they do sometimes ask about it and then you're happy if you recognize the question

**If you need to dive deep into probability theory:** [https://mathstat.slu.edu/\~speegle/\_book/probchapter.html#probabilitybasics](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/probchapter.html#probabilitybasics). I honestly bombed all probability brainteasers I got asked. It can make you feel stupid but looking back at my undergrad material (which is a veeeeery long time ago) I realized that I was once upon a time able to answer these kinds of questions, I just don’t need them for work. Given that they’re rarely asked I wouldn’t focus on this too much honestly.

**For general machine learning & stats:**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9V07EIfIg&list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D\_qZ5V&index=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9V07EIfIg&list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D_qZ5V&index=1) This video series was my bible. IMO it covers everything you’ll need in data science interviews about machine learning. Honestly, no-one ever asked me anything more complicated than logistic regression or how random forests work on a high level. For reading things up [I also can’t recommend the ISLR book enough](https://www.statlearning.com/)

**On product interviews:**[https://vimeo.com/385283671/ec3432147b](https://vimeo.com/385283671/ec3432147b) I watched this video by Facebook many times. I think if you use their techniques you’ll easily pass most product interviews.

# On recruiter calls

These are really easy imo, in the later stage I had an 80-90% success rate. I made a script for my intro and it took around 4-5 minutes to say everything. This is quite long also because I make sure I speak slowly and clearly when introducing myself, but the structure is the roughly like this:

1. Brief introduction on background + specializations (if you’re really, I mean REALLY good at ML modeling feel free to mention right in the beginning that this is how you’re perceived at work
2. Overview over your current department / team
3. What is your work mode (e.g. cross functional teams, embedded data scientist, data science team)
4. What kind of projects have you worked on
5. What is the scope of those projects (end-to-end, workshops, short projects). It also helps to give a ballpark of their usual timeframe
6. What are your responsibilities in those projects
7. What is your tech-stack / Alternatively: give examples throughout the projects of where you e.g. work with sklearn, pandas, …

I have made great experiences with that. Usually I apologise if I feel that I was going into too much detail or spoke too long, but so far everyone was fine with this and it is imo a great entry point for further discussions. I use this intro also for every other time I meet someone new.

# On hiring manager calls

These are imo quite easy, it’s usually more about the team fit and you shouldn’t have problems if you prepared with the Facebook material. Have some stories about projects ready as they usually ask you about at least 1 or 2 of them. Get familiar with answering questions in the STAR format.

I sometimes made the experience that they’re a bit pushy with their questions. If you feel that they’re focusing a lot on a specific project where you might feel that it’s not the most relevant for the role I recommend leading the direction politely away from there. I sometimes experienced that they were asking many questions about a rather simple model where I also didn’t do any ETL/database work. I recommend saying something in the way of „while surely an ARIMA model is useful, I would like to emphasise that we normally use it as a baseline because it’s easy to explain, but I do prefer increasing the complexity if the project allows for that, as I did for example in project Z. As this was one of my most impactful projects so far I’d love to elaborate on that as well if you’re okay with that, as I want to give you the best possible overview on my skillset and areas of interest.“ If they keep pushing about that not so relevant project I would consider it a red flag honestly and I had such cases before, even though they were very rare.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyn0CKPuPlA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyn0CKPuPlA)

Let me just leave these here.

# On take home assignments

I’ve done a few of them. I learned a lot from them. I hated every single one of them. I hated Leetcode even more in the beginning, but I’ve started to appreciate it, because take homes are just so arbitrary. As I had advanced talks with a couple companies, I skipped more and more of them. At some point I started telling companies that I don’t have time to do them due to other commitments and pending offers. The ones that were enthusiastic about hiring me moved me forward anyway. The ones where I didn’t leave a great impression told me it’s a requirement. So my advice is: If you’re willing to walk away from the process, decline them. It’s not respectful of our time. In one case I told a company that I can’t do it but I’m happy to explain how I’d approach it in detail in a call, otherwise I’d have to withdraw my application. The take home was very extensive, evaluate a large public dataset, do the EDA, fit some models, build an API, dockerize it and show you’ll make a prediction from the worker. They were a bit unorganised and scheduled a meeting about it, but the one evaluating it was super surprised that I didn’t prepare anything. We ended up coding a toy model and deploying it anyway and they forwarded me in the process anyway. Again, I would only recommend this if you’re willing to walk away from the offer, for me this was 50/50.

# On scheduling interviews

In general, bigger companies move slower, but I would suggest mass applying once you’re talking to a few of your favourites. I started practicing on unimportant roles about 1-2 months before I went hardcore with interviewing. I recommend not accepting any offers too early, the market is crazy right now! However, once you have an offer and you had at least a chat with the recruiter or better the hiring manager for a role, even big tech companies can move quickly! After my first offer I had many processes expedited and completed in 2-3 weeks.

# On anything else

Feel free to ask here. As this is a throwaway I won’t check my DM, but I will try to answer any publicly posted questions. Good luck everyone!",669,68,dscience_throwaway,2022-02-22 09:55:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/syjt0c/hopefully_almost_everything_you_need_to_know/,0,datascience
m71ijk,Imposter syndrome and prioritizing what to learn,"Imposter syndrome comes up in this sub a lot, and as someone who feels like he has (mostly) learned to manage it, I wanted to share my experience with it - and what was ultimately my major breakthrough.

In a nutshell, there are three ideas that you need to get in your head in order to get over imposter syndrome:

1. You are a generally competent person
2. There are always going to be people that know more about a certain area of data science than you *and that's ok and expected.* Even more importantly: you're not the smartest person in the planet, so if you look hard enough you're going to find people that are better than you at everything you do *and that's ok.*
3. You have a finite amount of time to learn things, and your goal shouldn't be to learn the most, but to learn the things that maximize your specific goals - generally, this is going to be career advancement, but for some it may be something else. 

In that order.

I think that, generally, imposter syndrome shows up in a thought cycle that goes the opposite direction. That is:

1. You don't have enough time to learn something you want to learn.
2. You look around and see that there are other people that know that thing you don't have time to learn
3. You feel incompetent

So when you feel that, flip it: 

1. Remind yourself that you are a competent person - if you weren't, you wouldn't have gotten to the position you are in right now, whether that's graduating from college or leading a data science team (yes, even DS team leaders catch the 'drome from time to time).
2. Remind yourself that when you look for people who know more than you about a specific area, you are guaranteed to find them - that's just how it works. People choose to specialize in certain areas, and if you only focus on that area of expertise, you are going to feel inadequate. But even more importantly, recognize that if you run into someone who is better than you at literally everything you do, that doesn't diminish your value - it just means you have run into someone that is pretty special\*
3. Get back to prioritizing what to learn. Do you *need* to learn that or do you just *want* to learn it to feel better about yourself? If the latter, learn to let it go, and focus on the things you need to learn - and save the things you want to learn for when you have the time, which will come.

\* As an anecdote - my first encounter with this scenario was a professor that literally did everything I liked doing - but better. He was a tenured professor at a top school, he had come \*this\* close to being a professional soccer player, and he was a classically trained musician, was in incredibly shape for his age and was a generally charming dude. I was a fumbling grad student who played recreational soccer poorly and played in a shitty metal band that no one ever went to see play, out of shape and generally a not-so-charming dude. 

It made me *incredibly* self-conscious for about a minute until I realized ""wait up... this guy is just an abject abnormality of humanity. I shouldn't feel bad about myself, I should just be impressed by how smart and accomplished this guy is *because 99.99999% of the population would be looking up at him too"".*

That helped me later in life when I would encounter people who I felt were just fundamentally smarter people than me. In particular, I remember hiring someone for my team that was so smart and thinking ""there is a better chance that I am going to be working for her in 10 years than the other way around"" *and being ok with that.*",665,90,dfphd,2021-03-17 14:22:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/m71ijk/imposter_syndrome_and_prioritizing_what_to_learn/,0,datascience

ltkt9s,R is far superior to Python for data manipulation.,"I am a data scientist and have a pipeline that usually consists of SQL DB ->>> slide deck of insights. I have access to Python and R and I am equally skilled in both, but I always find myself falling back to the beautiful Tidyverse of dplyr, stringr, pipes and friends over pandas. The real game changer for me is the %>% pipe operator, it's wonderful to work with. I can do all preprocessing in one long chain without making a single variable, while in pandas I find myself swamped with df, df_no_nulls, df_no_nulls_norm etc. etc. (INB4 choose better variable names but you get my point). The best part about the chain is that it is completely debuggable as it's not nested. The group_by/summarise/mutate/filter grammar is really really good at it's job in comparison to pandas, particularly mutate. The only thing I wish R had that Python has is list comprehension, but there are a ton of things I wish pandas did better that R's Tidyverse does. 

Of course, all the good ML frameworks are written in Python that blows R out of the water further down the pipeline. 

I would love to hear your experience working with both tools for data manipulation.

12dbhsg,"Pandas 2.0 is going live, and Apache Arrow will replace Numpy, and that's a great thing!","With Pandas 2.0, no existing code should break and everything will work as is. However, the primary update that is subtle is the use of Apache Arrow API vs. Numpy for managing and ingesting data (using methods like read\_csv, read\_sql, read\_parquet, etc). This new integration is hope to increase efficiency in terms of memory use and improving the usage of data types such string,  datatime, and categories.  


>Python data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc) are very slow and can't be used. So the data representation is not Python and is not standard, and an implementation needs to happen via Python extensions, usually implemented in C (also in C++, Rust and others). For many years, the main extension to represent arrays and perform operations on them in a fast way has been NumPy. And this is what pandas was initially built on.  
>  
>While NumPy has been good enough to make pandas the popular library it is, it was never built as a backend for dataframe libraries, and it has some important limitations.

**Summary of improvements include:**

* **Managing missing values:** By using Arrow, pandas is able to deal with missing values without having to implement its own version for each data type. Instead, the Apache Arrow in-memory data representation includes an equivalent representation as part of its specification
* **Speed:** Given an example of a dataframe with 2.5 million rows running in the author's laptop, running the `endswith` function is 31.6x fasters using Apache Arrow vs. Numpy (14.9ms vs. 471ms, respectively)
* **Interoperability:** Ingesting a data in one format and outputting it in a different format should not be challenging. For example, moving from SAS data to Latex, using Pandas <2.0 would require:
   * Load the data from SAS into a pandas dataframe
   * Export the dataframe to a parquet file
   * Load the parquet file from Polars
   * Make the transformations in Polars
   * Export the Polars dataframe into a second parquet file
   * Load the Parquet into pandas
   * Export the data to the final LATEX file  
However, with PyArrow, the operation can be as simple as such (after Polars bug fixes and using Pandas 2.0):

&#8203;

    loaded_pandas_data = pandas.read_sas(fname)

* **Expanding Data Type Support:**

>Arrow types are broader and better when used outside of a numerical tool like NumPy. It has better support for dates and time, including types for date-only or time-only data, different precision (e.g. seconds, milliseconds, etc.), different sizes (32 bits, 63 bits, etc.). The boolean type in Arrow uses a single bit per value, consuming one eighth of memory. It also supports other types, like decimals, or binary data, as well as complex types (for example a column where each value is a list). There is [a table](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/reference/arrays.html?highlight=arrowdtype#pyarrow) in the pandas documentation mapping Arrow to NumPy types.

w2via6,Curious to see how an industry data scientist approaches a modeling problem? I'll be livestreaming a Kaggle problem this Thursday!,"Hi! I am ar\_t\_e\_m\_is, a senior data scientist and member of this sub :) I did create a new profile for this, but I do have a main I'd be willing to share if someone would like to DM.

I am hoping to offer an opportunity for aspiring and junior data scientists or analytics professionals to see what data science and data analytics is all about, by doing a live-stream of a data science project :). It is very common in industry, especially non-tech, for stakeholders to ask for a ""proof of concept"" quickly. I'm going to build one live :)

On **Thursday July 21** around **830pm EDT**, I will be doing a livestream on Twitch with a dataset I have never analyzed, and working on a machine learning solution while live streaming :) I will analyze the dataset, prep it for a modeling problem, and try to build and optimize a model while also unlocking business-driven insights :) And, yes, this does include searching Stack Overflow and debugging along the way! During the stream, I will be talking about my career path, how I got to where I am at, and offering insight into the successes and failures of my career.

If you'd like to learn more about my background, I've included a redacted version of my resume. The link to the channel is in my profile, or I can include in this post so long as it doesn't break rule #3 for the sub!

Would LOVE to see you there, and will be very responsive with answering all questions about the process, my career, and the data science field in general.

If you have any questions, feel free to post below or DM!

Hope to see you there :)

i3o4fe,I am tired of being assessed as a 'software engineer' in job interviews.,"This is largely just a complaint post, but I am sure there are others here who feel the same way.

My job got Covid-19'd in March, and since then I have been back on the job search. The market is obviously at a low-point, and I get that, but what genuinely bothers me is that when I am applying for a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, or Machine Learning Engineering position, and am asked to fill out a timed online code assessment which was clearly meant for a typical software developer and not an analytics professional.

Yes, I use python for my job. That doesn't mean any test that employs python is a relevant assessment of my skills. It's a tool, and different jobs use different tools differently. Line cooks use knives, as do soldiers. But you wouldn't evaluate a line cook for a job on his ability to knife fight. Don't expect me to write some janky-ass tree-based sorting algorithm from scratch when it has 0% relevance to what my actual job involves.",663,187,CactusOnFire,2020-08-04 17:54:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/i3o4fe/i_am_tired_of_being_assessed_as_a_software/,0,datascience

jpljoo,First Year As A Data Scientist Reflection,"It's wild to think it's been a year since I first became a data scientist, and I wanted to share some of the lessons I've learned so far.

**1. The Data Science Title Is Meaningless**

I still have no idea what a ""typical"" data scientist is, and many companies have no idea either. A data science role is very dependent on the company and the maturity of their data infrastructure. Instead of a title, focus on what business problems are present for a particular company and how your skillset in data can solve it. Want to build data products? Then chase those business problems! Interested in using deep learning? Find companies with the infrastructure and problems that warrant such methods. Chasing data problems instead of titles will put you in a better place.

**2. Ask More Questions Before Coding**

I've been burned a few times learning that most non-data people have no idea what data solution they need. Jumping straight into coding after getting a request will set you up for failure. Take a step back and ask probing questions for further clarification. Many times you will find that someone will ask for ""ABC"" but after further questions they actually need ""XYZ"". This skill of getting clarity and consensus among stakeholders, regarding data problems and solutions, is such an important facet of being an effective data scientist.

**3. Prototype to Build Buy In**

Start with a simple example, get feedback, implement feedback, then repeat. This process saves you time and makes your stakeholders feel heard/valued. For example, I recently had to create an algorithm to classify our product's users. Rather than jumping straight into python, I created a slide deck describing the algorithms logic visually and an excel spreadsheet of different use cases. I presented these prototypes to stakeholders and then implemented their feedback into the prototype. By the end of this process it was clear as to what I needed to code and the stakeholders understood what value my data solution would bring to them.

**4. Talk to Domain Experts**

You end up making A LOT of assumptions about the data. Talking to domain experts of your data subject and or product will help you make better assumptions. Go talk to Sales or Customer Success teams to learn about customer pain points. Talk to engineers to learn why certain product decisions were made. If it's a specific domain, talk to a subject matter expert to learn whether there is an important nuance about the data or if it's a data quality issue.

**5. Learn Software Engineering Best Practices**

Notebooks are awesome for experimenting and data exploration, but they can only take you so far. Learn how to build scripts for your data science workflow instead of just using notebooks. Take advantage of git to keep track of your code. Write unit tests to make sure your code is working as expected. Put effort into how you structure your code (e.g. functions, separate scripts, etc.). This will help you stand out as a data scientist, as well as make it way easier to put your data solutions into production.

There is probably more, but these are the topics top of mind for me right now! Would love to hear what other data scientist have learned as well!",660,43,dope_as_soap,2020-11-07 05:48:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/jpljoo/first_year_as_a_data_scientist_reflection/,0,datascience

gf9hrs,What makes a good personal project - from the perspective of a hiring manager,"We often see the question on this sub around ""how do I build a portfolio as a student?"", i.e., what projects should I work on?

If the resumes I've reviewed over the last 5 years are any indication, most people seem to think that the answer is a Jupyter Notebook that takes a pretty standard dataset, does EDA, builds a model, and presents a bunch of plots showing quality of fit.

From my perspective, these projects are pretty much useless. I say that because odds are that I can figure out if you can build such a notebook by just asking you a handful of questions and spending 5 minutes talking to you. Most importantly, being able to do that for a project that you chose (whether personal or capstone project) makes this project worthless in terms of helping me evaluate how you overcome obstacles - odds are that the way your overcame obstacles was by choosing a project that was easy to do and had relatively clean, available data.

So how do you make a better personal project?

**Start with a problem statement that is actually useful, even if you don't know how to solve it**

As a rule of thumb, an imperfect solution to a useful problem is better than a perfect solution to a useless one. I'd rather see you build a linear regression model to solve something that people actually care about instead of building a deep learning model to predict Titanic deaths. Why? Because problems that matter show a hiring manager that you can think through how to use data science to drive value. And if the process of getting there sends you down some windy roads, it also shows the hiring manager that you're able to navigate them. These are two *really* important skillsets.

Mind you, when I say ""useful"" I don't mean ""important"". I'm not telling you that you need to go find a cure for cancer, just to focus on something that *someone* will find a user for.

Example:

* Building a  model to optimize a fantasy football lineup.

Again, not important - just useful.

**Focus on a problem that goes beyond predicting a single metric**

A lot of data science ""side projects"" that I see focus on predicting a single quantity. While sometimes you will find yourself doing that in a work setting, most of the time your work goes beyond that, meaning you are normally predicting a quantity so that you can then influence a decision process, or estimate a broader outcome, etc.

So if you're going to work on a side project, try to follow through your model ""all the way"", i.e., through to an actual outcome that could be useful.

Example:

* Don't just predict the number of points a player will score in fantasy football - actually build that into a model that can help someone make decisions in a more complex setting (like daily fantasy football, or evaluating draft strategies).

**Start with ugly, raw data if you can**

If you start your project with mostly clean, post-processed data you've already skipped a big step in terms demonstrating what you can do. If instead you choose to go for something that isn't in its final form, you can flex a couple of different muscles.

For example, you could scrape data. Not super complicated, but it already shows me an extra skillset. Or you could start with data in log format and writing the necessary scripts to convert it into tabular form.

Example:

* Instead of starting with aggregate NFL stats, start with NFL play-by-play logs and write a script to convert ""S.Barkley runs for 10 yard loss PENALTY Holding: NYG REJECTED"" into the appropriate statline.

**If possible, build an actual product - not just analysis**

Building a product allows you a couple of advantages. For one, it allows you to just share a link to something that people can actually use. Secondly, if your tool were to get any traffic, it allows you to validate your idea. Lastly, it allows you to flex a completely different muscle - the fact that you can think through basic (or advanced) designs and deploy a solution to an environment.

Example:

* Build a web-app where people can make selections and your tool will output a recommended lineup in fantasy football.

**Work alone**

One of the big issues with group projects outside of a work setting is that it's hard for a hiring manager to corroborate what you did personally vs. what others did. That means that some hiring managers may just choose to assume that you didn't have a part in all of it - and worse, that you don't have all of those skills.

If you work by yourself, you can guarantee that an interviewer will assume that you did all of it, and there will be no questions of what you can/cannot do.

Some may say ""but group projects show that I can work in a team!"". And I think everyone that has ever worked in a group project knows that they seldom punish the person in a group who most lazy and hardest to work with. 

Obviously this is just my opinion, but since the topic comes up often I figured it was worth putting it down to at least start a conversation.",653,58,dfphd,2020-05-07 16:13:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gf9hrs/what_makes_a_good_personal_project_from_the/,0,datascience

hecc72,Why the ability to concentrate is the most important skill in 2020,"Many of us usually have at least one thing that we know we need to do. And if somehow we managed to sit down and do it from start to finish. Our life would be better because of it. The problem is that people put off that thing, they do anything under the sun to distract themselves.

Being a person who naturally gets distracted easily and was surely one of the worst procrastinators. I can confidently say it's never too late to make a change. Because if somehow even I managed to find little strategies and create little short cuts to become someone who can concentrate for long periods of time. Then you can too!

\#1 Why it's so important?

First of all, it's probably not a secret that getting sidetracked nowadays is easier than ever. We are constantly bombarded with ads and online marketing. In fact, according to research, it takes around 15-20 min. to get back to your 100% concentration after getting distracted. Basically, if we cut to the chase - this new distracting digital age creates a huge demand for people who can resist distraction and concentrate.

2#The bar is so lower than you think

If you can dive in even for one hour on your most important thing for the day with a ruthless and intense focus. You will make substantial progress in your life. And as you get used to that hour of concentration. You can upgrade that to 2 or 3 hours. Just think how much intense focus that is. You will skyrocket past your goals!

3# Guilt-free pleasure and balance

I know that many of us want to have a balanced life. We want to achieve something or do something meaningful but still enjoy life. For example, maybe you want to work on your personal projects, but at the same time, you don't want to give up video games. This was one of the biggest pains I struggled myself. I would play a lot of video games but then at the same time I would feel guilty for not making progress on my personal goals. And it's funny because the solution is so simple. You can play the crap out of those video games after you put a tremendous amount of focus on something else. This way you don't feel guilty and can fully immerse yourself into video games.

And if the perks of mastering concentration don't entice you, you can stop here...

16vaaco,It's not just you. Everyone hates the return to office,"Somehow, I am lucky enough to land a completely remote role, 100% virtual because the rest of my team is virtual based but I still have to go into the office at least 12 times a year for bogus meetings to sit in a conference room while we all use WebEx, totally immersive right? But we have frequent meetings with other people in our field, data scientists, engineers, architects, etc. They are all back in office 4 days a week, and each of them has this ashy tone, they grudgingly hate being in the office, despise it, because who wants to go to a stuffy office?


Here are the top complaints that I have noticed from people about being in office

- The commute is terrible. Some people have to commute as much as 50 minutes one way, and that's not including traffic. That's crazy. You're not getting paid for that. That's free labor and travel for your company


- The office is incredibly distracting. Cubicles are typically open, so people can freely walk up and talk to you, make eye contact with you which starts a conversation, but you're still under the same time crunch you were when you worked from home completely isolated in your nice office away from everyone else


- ""Collaborative spaces"" and ""focus areas"" are bullsh*t. So many nice little desks, nooks, rooms for you to go to to focus or meet with others. But here's the thing, you never see anyone using those because I guess where they are? At their desk, working, constantly. No one ever has the time to use them. My office is so incredibly nice, and every time I walk around, I feel like I'm the only one taking a walk because I see everyone glued to their desks

- You're distracted constantly by others who are at different levels than you. The only way I figured out that there is some college intern making twice as much as I am doing a little bit more than me is by speaking to people in the immediate vicinity of my desk. Machine learning engineer versus data scientist. The difference? They use a little bit more power platform, a couple more tools, 20 more lines of Python a day. Congrats, here is 40K more for you. This can be very distracting, because you see these people all the time


- NO PRODUCTIVITY OR OTHER GAIN. Literally no benefit or gain from being back in the office. Just disgruntled people


- office supplies are shit. At home, I have an ultra wide monitor that I also use for personal PC gaming so I can just literally KVM switch it over. I have a modded gaming mouse and keyboard, a $200 Logitech pro headset with superior sound quality and microphone. You know what I don't have at the office? Any of this stuff. Yeah. A $5 Logitech mouse and keyboard that is extremely noisy and uncomfortable has no ergonomics at all. Office chairs are not ergonomic They are just the cheapest they could get. Uncomfortable $0.90 headsets and webcams


- MANDATORY extracurricular events and activities in or outside of work. Yes, this is real. After hours socials, restaurants, social outings. These are disguised as optional, but you will often get bullied teased or pressured into them. This also does not grant you any leeway during any project, you still have to get all work and projects done with this loss of time",646,257,databro92,2023-09-29 12:27:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16vaaco/its_not_just_you_everyone_hates_the_return_to/,0,datascience

17798wz,Warning to would be master’s graduates in “data science”,"I teach data science at a university (going anonymous for obvious reasons). I won't mention the institution name or location, though I think this is something typical across all non-prestigious universities. Basically, master's courses in data science, especially those of 1 year and marketed to international students, are a scam. 

Essentially, because there is pressure to pass all the students, we cannot give any material that is too challenging. I don't want to put challenging material in the course because I want them to fail--I put it because challenge is how students **grow** and **learn**. Aside from being a data analyst, being even an entry-level data scientist requires being good at a lot of things, and knowing the material deeply, not just superficially. Likewise, data engineers have to be good software engineers.

But apparently, asking the students to implement a trivial function in Python is too much. Just working with high-level libraries won't be enough to get my students a job in the field. OK, maybe you don’t have to implement algorithms from scratch, but you have to at least wrangle data. The theoretical content is OK, but the practical element is far from sufficient.

It is my belief that only one of my students, a software developer, will go on to get a high-paying job in the data field. Some might become data analysts (which pays thousands less), and likely a few will never get into a data career.

Universities write all sorts of crap in their marketing spiel that bears no resemblance to reality. And students, nor parents, don’t know any better, because how many people are actually qualified to judge whether a DS curriculum is good? Nor is it enough to see the topics, you have to see the *assignments*. If a DS course doesn’t have at least one serious course in statistics, any SQL, and doesn’t make you solve real programming problems, it's no good.",644,313,anon_throwaway09557,2023-10-13 21:28:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17798wz/warning_to_would_be_masters_graduates_in_data/,0,datascience

sm96f5,Machine Learning Simplified Book,"Hello everyone. My name is Andrew and for several years I've been working on to make the learning path for ML easier. I wrote a manual on machine learning that everyone understands - Machine Learning Simplified Book.

The main purpose of my book is to build **an intuitive understanding** of how algorithms work through basic examples. In order to understand the presented material, it is enough to know basic mathematics and linear algebra.

After reading this book, you will know the basics of supervised learning, understand complex mathematical models, understand the entire pipeline of a typical ML project, and also be able to share your knowledge with colleagues from related industries and with technical professionals.

And for those who find the theoretical part not enough - I supplemented the book with a repository on **GitHub**, which has Python implementation of every method and algorithm that I describe in each chapter.

You can read the book absolutely free at the link below: -> https://themlsbook.com

h96nz8,Keep a Brag Document,"Hi everyone,

Thought I'd share some advice that has helped me so far in my Data Science career. It has to do with recording your wins at work - hope you like it!

\-----

The human brain is terrible at remembering information.

When we try to use the past to predict the future, we end up using *our memory* of the past. And our memory is extremely flawed, subject to whims and emotions.

One of the biggest consequences of this is at work.

You clock in 9-5 for days on days and then when you look back at what you did a year ago, you think “Where did all that time go?”

Even worse, if YOU can’t remember what the hell you did, how will your boss?

In an ideal world: you do a great job, your company rewards you. They’ll notice all the hard work you’re putting in. All the beautiful lines of code you’ve written.

But we don’t live in an ideal world. And the costliest mistake you can make in your career is not being proactive about recording your achievements and your little wins.

**Enter The Brag Document**

I first read about a Brag Document on [Julia Evan’s blog](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/#template).

By recording your small wins and accomplishments on a weekly basis, you accumulate concrete evidence of what you’ve achieved.

And these “wins” don’t need to be Olympic Gold Medals.

Did you help a coworker understand how to use an API? Jot it down.

Did you anticipate a nasty bug and proactively reach out about it? It goes on there.

Did you help mentor a junior employee? That’s definitely part of it.

Over time, I promise you, your brag document will do wonders for your career.

Sure - negotiating a raise or getting a promotion will become easier. In fact, come performance review time, even your boss will thank you for it. Those things are hard to write from pure memory. More on this a bit later.

But the biggest benefit of a brag document lies in identifying *what you enjoy doing*.

Your wins are likely a representation of tasks you enjoyed. And you should be very proactive about focusing on those tasks going forward.

Use your Brag Document to ruthlessly identify the tasks you want to spend more time on, as well as the tasks you don’t want to do anymore.

**The Pareto Principle**

The Pareto Principle states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

At work, 80% of what you can feel proud about will stem from 20% of what you do. You can think of your Brag Document as representing that 20%.

Use this 20% to ask yourself questions like:

* Is there a common theme amongst this work?
* Are there topics here that I thought I didn’t actually like but turns out I do?
* How much of this work involves collaboration with other departments / teams?
* How can I do more of this work?

**Frequency**

Update your brag document on a weekly basis. You can set it as a recurring event on your calendar.

The biggest benefit of this is that it forces you to scrutinize your output on a regular basis and allows you to be proactive about focusing on the work you want to do.

Let’s say that after a few weeks of work, you genuinely have nothing to put on your brag document.

There’s a chance you had a bit of a slow period at work, but maybe you’re just stuck somewhere you don’t want to be?

**Collaborate**

Talk about your brag document with co-workers. Ask them what you think you should put on yours.

You’ll often find that they’re able to mention things you completely forgot or didn’t even seem to think about.

Remember - just because something seems easy *to you* doesn’t mean it’s easy in general. 5 minutes of work may have taken you 10 years to learn.

You should also encourage your team to keep their own brag documents. Help each other be accountable and celebrate each other’s wins. This builds a strong team culture.

**Your Manager**

You should try to share your brag document with your manager once a quarter.

It might seem **weird** or **unnatural** \- you’re basically dumping all your achievements into their lap. But this actually really makes their life easier.

If your manager ever needs to vouch for you internally, then boom - they have direct evidence they can use. If your manager needs to reshuffle workload, then they know what you’re good at and what you can improve on.

Even better, you and your manager should go through your brag document together.

Tell them what you want to do more of. Tell them what you wish was on there more.

You’ll both be able to identify areas in which you’re doing a great job and also areas in which your manager perhaps wants you to focus on more.

Another aspect that’s helpful here is with goal setting - your manager and you likely work together anyway to determine quarterly goals.

You should use your brag document to help you identify what type of goals you need to be hitting. Very often, we will achieve goals and then think “Wait..what was the point again?”

By using your brag document to set goals, you’ll be much more likely to be working towards something that you find rewarding.

**Ending thoughts**

Once you start getting in the habit of using a brag document, operating without one will feel like doing your work in the dark.

Over time, you’ll develop a much clearer picture of the type of work that you want to focus on for your career.

seufwd,Anyone else feel like the interview process for data science jobs is getting out of control?,"It’s becoming more and more common to have 5-6 rounds of screening, coding test, case studies, and multiple rounds of panel interviews. Lots of ‘got you’ type of questions like ‘estimate the number of cows in the country’ because my ability to estimate farm life is relevant how?  


l had a company that even asked me to put together a PowerPoint presentation using actual company data and which point I said no after the recruiter told me the typical candidate spends at least a couple hours on it. I’ve found that it’s worse with midsize companies. Typically FAANGs have difficult interviews but at least they ask you relevant questions and don’t waste your time with endless rounds of take home   
assignments.   


When I got my first job at Amazon I actually only did a screening and some interviews with the team and that was it! Granted that was more than 5 years ago but it still surprises me the amount of hoops these companies want us to jump through. I guess there are enough people willing to so these companies don’t really care.   


For me Ive just started saying no because I really don’t feel it’s worth the effort to pursue some of these jobs personally.",633,198,Swan_233,2022-01-28 16:21:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/seufwd/anyone_else_feel_like_the_interview_process_for/,0,datascience

edgai0,Advice for those entering the workforce: your job is not to be right - and it's certainly not to prove others wrong,"Thinking back to my days as a first year data scientist, one of the most difficult transitions I've seen people make is how they measure their value.

Because academia is primarily an environment in which you're measured by how right or wrong you are, a lot of people transition into the workplace thinking the same. What's worse, some go further and extend that to the point of thinking that there is value in proving others wrong.

That is fundamentally not going to work. And that is because people in the workplace are measured almost exclusively on how productive they are - they are measured on results.

Corollary 1: if it's wrong but it works, then it's not wrong.

Corollary 2: if you're right but it doesn't change the outcome, then it doesn't matter.

Corollary 3: if you're right, but it doesn't work, then you're wrong. 

Corollary 4: if you prove someone else wrong, but their answer works and yours doesn't, then they're right and you're wrong. 

Corollary 5: if you prove someone's solution to be wrong even though it does provide value, then you have not yet provided any value until you propose something better. 

I cannot emphasize how much you can limit your career by focusing on right vs. wrong. Right vs. wrong is irrelevant; productivity always rules.

EDIT: Since many have had an issue with the definition of something that works vs. something that is wrong:

This is the part that people miss - it is rare that bad science works.

When things that a person sees as ""wrong science"" work, I normally find that the overwhelming majority of the time, if that person is junior, what is actually happening is that:

 1. It's not actually wrong, and the person just doesn't understand why it's right.

 2. It's not 100% right, but it's right enough to provide value. And some people interpret that to mean wrong, which is too binary in the world of modeling. 95% right isn't wrong, it's just 95% right. 

The only scenario where you will see bad science work with any degree of frequency is when it has been tested over too limited a set of scenarios - in which case it should be relatively easy to point out where it will fail, and then you can focus on outputs - on how it won't work, rather than on it being wrong.",622,91,dfphd,2019-12-20 21:23:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/edgai0/advice_for_those_entering_the_workforce_your_job/,1,datascience

vtzw0b,The Data Science Trap: A Rebuttal,"More often than not, I see comments on this thread suggesting the dilution of the Data Science discipline into a glorified Data Analyst position. Maybe my 10 years in the Data Science field leads me to possessing a level of naivety, but I’ve concluded that Data Science in its academic interpretation is far from its practicality in application. 

Take for example the rise of VC funding of startups and compare the ROI/success rate of AI-specific startups versus non-AI centric companies. Most AI startups in the past 5 years have failed. Why is this? Overwhelmingly, there is over promise of results with underperformance in value. That simply cannot be blamed on faulty hiring managers. 

Now shift to large market cap institutions. AI and Machine Learning provide value added in specific situations, but not with the prevalence that would support the volume of Data Science positions advertising classic AI/ML…the infrastructure simply doesn’t exist. Instead, entry level Data Scientists enter the workforce expecting relatively clean datasets/sources with proper governance and pedigree when reality slaps them in the face after finding out Fred down the hall has 5 terabytes in a set of disparate hard drives under his desk. (Obviously this is hyperbole but I wouldn’t put it past some users here saying ‘oh shit how do you know Fred?!’) 

These early career individuals who become underwhelmed with industry are not to blame either. Academic institutions have raced ass first toward the cash cow of offering Data Scientist majors and certificates. Such courses are often taught by many professors whose last time in a for-profit firm was during the days where COBAL was a preferred language of choice.  Sure most can reach the topics of AI/ML but can they teach its application in an industry ill-prepared for it?

This leads me to my final word of advice for whomever is seeking it. Regardless of your title (Data Scientist, Data Analyst, ML Engineer, etc), find value in providing value. If you spend 5 months converting a 97.8% accurate model into 99.99% accuracy and net $10K in savings but the intern down the hall netted $10M in savings by simply running a simple regression model after digging into Fred’s desk, who provided more value added?

Those who provide value will be paid the magnitude their contribution necessitates. 

Anyways, be great.

1arg0lv,A harsh truth about data science....,"Broadly speaking, the job of a data scientist is to use data to understand things, create value, and inform business decisions. It it *not necessarily* to implement and utilize advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques. That's not to say that you can't or won't use ML/AI to inform business decisions, what I'm saying is that it's not always required to. Obviously this is going to depend on your company, their products, and role, but let's talk about a quintessential DS position at a quintessential company.

I think the problem a lot of newer or prospective Data Scientists run into is that they learn all these advanced techniques and want to start using them right away. They apply them anywhere they can, kind of shoehorning them in and not having a clear idea of what it is they are even trying to accomplish in the first place. In other words, the tools lead the problem. Of course, the way it should be is that the problem leads the tools. I'm coming to find for like 50+% of the things I'm asked to do, a time series visualization, contingency tables, and histograms are sufficient to answer the question to the satisfaction of the business leaders. That's it. We're done, on to the next one. Start simple, if the simple techniques don't answer the question, then move on to the more advanced stuff. I speak from experience, of course.

In my opinion, understanding when to use simple tools vs when to break out the big guns is way harder then figuring out how to use the big guns. Even harder still is taking your findings and translating them into actual, actionable insights that a business can use. Okay, so you built a multi-layer CNN that models customer behavior? That's great, but what does the business do with it? For example, can you use it to identify customers who might buy more product with more advertising? Can you put a list of those customers on the CEO's desk? Could a simple regression model have done the same in 1/4 of the time? These are skills that take years to learn and so it's totally understandable for newer or prospective DSs to not have them. But they do not seem to be emphasized in a lot of degree programs or MOOCs. It seems to me like they just hand you a dataset and tell you what to do with it. It's great that you can use the tools they tell you to on it, but you're missing out on the identifying which tools to even use part in the first place.

Just my 2c.

17tit0r,6 months as a Data Science freelancer,"I have been a freelance Data Scientist for 6 month and I have more job offers than I can manage (I turn down offers every week). 

Some people have written me to get some tips on how to start and get some clients. 
So these are a few things I tried to find clients on Upwork, LinkedIn and in online communities.

1) Look for projects on Upwork. 
Set up a nice profile, showcase your project portfolio, research the market, bid on several projects and be willing to set a cheap rate at the beginning. 
You won't make much money the first month, but you will get exposure, your Upwork rating will improve and you can start to bid on some higher paying jobs. 
In 6 months my rate went up 4 times, so don't think it takes so long to get to a good hourly rate. 

2) Improve and polish your LinkedIn profile. 
Many recruiters will write you here. 
Insert the right keywords on your profile, document your previous work, post something work related every week, if you can. 
This is a long game but pays off because instead of bidding for jobs, in the end the recruiters will start to write you.

3) Join online communities of entrepreneurs.
There are several small businesses that look for Data experts and beyond. They have projects ongoing and want to hire freelancers for a short time. 
You can meet them in these communities. Look for them on Twitter, Discord, Slack, Reddit...
Engage with them, share what you do and soon you will start to get some interest. This type of interaction quickly turns into job opportunities.

4) Write. 
Just create a blog and post regularly. Post about what you do, the tools you have used and so on. Better to post a tutorial, a new tech you tried out, a small model you developed. 
All the successful people I know have this habit. They write and share what they do regularly.

5) Put yourself out there and interact online. 
Maybe one day you share something and it gets retweeted, maybe you pick up a good SEO keyword in your blog, you never know. That's why it's important to increase your exposure. You will increase your chances of getting noticed and potentially land a new client.

6) Be generous 
Once you do the above soon you will be noticed and people will start to contact you. 
They will not offer you a contract. That's not how it works. after all, they don't know you and they don't trust you. But something you wrote hit them. Probably they will ask for your help and advice on a specific issue. 
Give advice on the tech to use, how to solve a problem, how to improve their processes, give as much as you can, be honest and open. Say all you know and you will build trust. 
It's the start of a professional relationship.

7) Be patient
Not all conversations will turn into a job opportunity. Sometimes they lead nowhere, sometimes there is no budget, sometimes it takes months to sign a contract. In my experience maybe 2-3 out of 10 conversations turn into a job offer. 
Accept it. It's normal.

pf9j9s,Resume observation from a hiring manager,"Largely aiming at those starting out in the field here who have been working through a MOOC. 

My (non-finance) company is currently hiring for a role and over 20% of the resumes we've received have a stock market project with a claim of being over 95% accurate at predicting the price of a given stock. On looking at the GitHub code for the projects, every single one of these projects has not accounted for look-ahead bias and simply train/test split 80/20 - allowing the model to train on future data. A majority of theses resumes have references to MOOCs, FreeCodeCamp being a frequent one. 

I don't know if this stock market project is a MOOC module somewhere, but it's a really bad one and we've rejected all the resumes that have it since time-series modelling is critical to what we do. So if you have this project, please either don't put it on your resume, or if you really want a stock project, make sure to at least split your data on a date and holdout the later sample (this will almost certainly tank your model results if you originally had 95% accuracy).",586,204,hybridvoices,2021-08-31 16:37:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/pf9j9s/resume_observation_from_a_hiring_manager/,0,datascience
mm7w8r,LinkedIn / Blind / This sub is not real life,"Not sure if this is relevant, but seeing so many posts about people feeling like they aren't good enough / smart enough / successful enough / \_\_\_\_\_ enough because they see others on LinkedIn / Blind / Twitter or even reddit posting about their sky high compensation and amazing accomplishments.

Keep in mind that the folks who post on these forums are not a representative sample. It naturally skews towards people who are drawn to high compensation / level / ""prestige""

Even sources like [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) only show the compensations of people who choose to share it, which again isn't a representative sample. If compensation / level / prestige is what you're after, by all means, go for it and work for it. But comparing yourself to people who  *humble brag* on social media does nothing good for your mental health. [Studies](https://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/) have shown that Instagram is bad for teens' mental health, comparing yourself to the humble braggers on LinkedIn/ Blind / other CS / DS focused social media would likely have a similar impact on your mental health too.

Also keep in mind that on average \~65,000 CS graduates graduate every year in the US. If you include China, India, and Russia the number is more like 460,000 graduates per year, of which \~45,000 are considered elite. My source is this [research article](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/14/6732). Assuming a 15% annual growth rate , that means \~3.5 million CS graduates just in the last 10 years,  (5.5 million in the last 20 years).

Of these, only about 10% (just napkin math based on number of employees in Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and assuming only \~50% of them are ""tech"" roles) can ever work in Big N, and of the 10% there, only about another 10% make it to Staff levels, which is where you see compensations of 500k+ (some seniors can make it too, but it's more reliably available at staff+ levels). And these salaries too are only common in SF Bay Area, Seattle, NYC, and maybe Austin. 

So you're comparing against 1% of an industry that is already on average better paid than most other industries. So take a deep breath, stop comparing yourself against humble braggers, and know that for the most part you will be ok.",588,96,None,2021-04-07 17:57:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mm7w8r/linkedin_blind_this_sub_is_not_real_life/,0,datascience

xqmj9q,I started out as an in-house data scientist and then moved on to management consulting. Here are 10 tips that have helped me greatly in business.,"I started out as an in-house data scientist and then moved on to data science management consulting. This is where I learned very important soft skills that made me a way better data scientist.

Note: clients in this case can be anyone that gives you an assignment. For example, your manager, an external client, your colleague, etc.

## 10 tips:

1.	**Be helpful, don’t be obedient**. Help your client in the best way possible, but set boundaries on what you will do. Some people see us as these magical creatures that can do everything. Protect yourself from that.
2.	**Small talk is not a waste of time**; it is a social lubricant that increases the client’s confidence in you.
3.	**Adjust your message to the audience.** Check who they are and what is important to them. Also, make sure you use the right terminology (e.g. do not use technical terms when talking to non-technical business people).
4.	**A good presentation is like a good conversation**. Make your point, but also leave room for questions.
5.	**If you do not know the client beforehand, start with an introduction.** Who are you? What is your background? What are your hobbies?
6.	**Nobody likes surprises**. If something unexpected comes up, discuss this with your client as soon as possible.
7.	**Make the client feel that the solution was his or her idea**. Explain all the available options and guide the client to the preferred solution. This depends on what you're working on of course. For example, if you are not sure what data to include, try to involve your client and come up with an answer together.
8.	**The client is not your friend**. Be friendly, but watch what you say about your private life.
9.	The more senior your audience is, **the more to the point you need to be**.
10. Being professional is not about removing emotion. **It is OK to smile** :).

I have a background in Marketing and now work in Data Science, and I can see such a huge difference between people who share my background and those who don't. The math guys tend to only care about numbers. They tell you if a number is up or down or high or low and they just stop there -- and if the stakeholder says the model doesn't match their gut, they just roll their eyes and call them ignorant. The people with a varied background make sure their model churns out something an Executive can read, understand, and make decisions off of, and they have an infinitely better understanding of what is and isn't helpful for their stakeholders.

1bxmy77,I made my very first python library! It converts reddit posts to text format for feeding to LLM's!,"Hello everyone, I've been programming for about 4 years now and this is my first ever library that I created!

## What My Project Does

It's called Reddit2Text, and it converts a reddit post (and all its comments) into a single, clean, easy to copy/paste string.

I often like to ask ChatGPT about reddit posts, but copying all the relevant information among a large amount of comments is difficult/impossible. I searched for a tool or library that would help me do this and was astonished to find no such thing! I took it into my own hands and decided to make it myself.

## Target Audience

This project is useable in its current state, and always looking for more feedback/features from the community!

## Comparison

There are no other similar alternatives AFAIK

Here is the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/NFeruch/reddit2text](https://github.com/NFeruch/reddit2text)

It's also available to download through pip/pypi :D

Some basic features:

1. Gathers the authors, upvotes, and text for the OP and every single comment
2. Specify the max depth for how many comments you want
3. Change the delimiter for the comment nesting

Here is an example truncated output: [https://pastebin.com/mmHFJtcc](https://pastebin.com/mmHFJtcc)

Under the hood, I relied heavily on the PRAW library (python reddit api wrapper) to do the actual interfacing with the Reddit API. I took it a step further though, by combining all these moving parts and raw outputs into something that's easily useable and very simple.

The way to do it is to look up a few dozen job postings for the role you want. From those postings, narrow it down to only the jobs you're interested in (data science is such a wide and non-standardized field that not all postings are applicable to you).

With the postings you're left with, identify which skills are common to most of those posts. Of those skills, some you will already have, so play them up in the experience of your resume. The ones that you don't have are ones that you should go learn.

Are there performant ways of coding or best practices that would make it clear a candidate had a deep understanding of SQL?

1bnmif0,Name & Shame: Carlyle Group Investment Data Science,"I think we're due for a name & shame! Sharing my experience in case it's helpful for future applicants.

# Company & Role

The Carlyle Group is a Private Equity mega-fund. They essentially buy and flip companies like a real estate investor buys and flips houses. They've recently (in the past few years) spun up a data science org. My understanding is that the responsibilities of this role would entail assisting the deal team in commercial due diligences of prospective investments, assisting in portfolio operations and consulting on advanced analytics for the portfolio companies, as well as company wide data science initiatives. My impression was that this role would not be very involved in deal sourcing.

# My Background

* FAANG Senior DS
* Worked in management consulting in the past - primarily as a data science consultant for Silicon Valley tech companies but also did a commercial due diligence project with our M&A practice as a DS consultant
* Ivy League masters in CS / Top 20 undergrad

# Application Process & Experience

* I first cold applied online
* After a short period of time I received an email from a Carlyle recruiter with a link to a 2 hour Hackerrank exam. I did not first receive any introductory call or even an introductory email - just an email with a URL to Hackerrank.
* I decided to take the exam. It consisted of:
   * One SQL (medium / window functions)
   * One Python (leetcode easy)
   * Discrete probability (e.g. probability of making a full house if you randomly draw 5 cards from a standard deck)
   * Domain specific data science questions (e.g. how would you apply data science to this private equity problem)
   * Overall I felt comfortable with all aspects of the exam and felt that it was well within my wheelhouse
* After completing the exam I sent a note to the recruiter. They scheduled a call with the ""senior recruiter"" for end of week
* The call with senior recruiter was fairly standard and covered the nature of the team, responsibilities of the role, and my background. I thought the call went well and was under the impression that I'd be moving forward in the process  (though I've learned never to take what recruiters say at face value)
* At the end of the call the senior recruiter asked if I had taken the Hackerrank exam yet. I was a bit surprised that they did not already know the answer to that question.
* After exactly one week of radio silence since the initial call, I emailed the first recruiter to let them know that I had seen some progress in my other searches (true) and asked if my application was still in consideration. I did not receive a response to this email.
* I waited one more week (two weeks since the initial call and about three weeks since I took the exam) and emailed the senior recruiter for a status update. I didn't receive a response to this email either but will edit this post if they ever do respond.

# Conclusion

* At this point I've concluded that I've been ghosted. I can only speculate as to why. I'm leaning towards them just being highly disorganized.
* For future applicants I strongly, strongly advise not taking their HackerRank exam unless you don't mind having your time wasted. I'm willing to bet nobody at Carlyle even looked at my test responses.

\*\*EDIT\*\*

It seems a lot of you think that ghosting is professionally acceptable. If you're investing your time, the bare minimum is a courtesy email to let you know you won't be moving forward in the process. That's actually table stakes.

o7c0z7,"R, I love you.","Hi all,

I just wanted to make this post to simply share my experience (and also get your perspective/input) using different coding languages, namely python and R, to perform data analysis. I am by no means any expert; just a simple user who is completely in awe with this field.

I have only recently started to code in R (2 months now) and ever since, I cannot help but love it. I only started learn to code since last year and like many, I started off with python because the ML project I was working on last year required me to learn this language.

Since then, I moved to a different lab and the folks there really wanted me to use R to develop the code for data cleaning, performing exploratory data analysis, regression analyses, etc..., since it is the most commonly used language in this field (Enviro. Chem).

While I was initially resistant at first to learn R, once I got the hang of it, it really started to feel like magic to me. What took me maybe 3 to 5 lines of code in python to perform a task (granted, I am not the best coder) is a simple function in R. Somehow, it all just intuitively makes sense to me.

I don't know; I don't find R getting much love out there (at least in my learning experience of data science), and just wanted to make a post about it. I aim to get much better in this language (and also python too), simply because I find this to be a very powerful language.

I guess that concludes my love letter to R.

joxdp4,Rant: Don't put bachelors as a minimum if you only hire masters.,"I am a senior in my undergraduate program and I'm about to graduate in the spring from a public 4-year university with a bachelors of science in data science. I have had 5 data related internships/jobs since being here culminating in 3 years of relevant experience but I can't seem to get through the online application wall. 

I've taken every data science/machine learning class I can that the school offers (some of which I took with grad students) so I thought that by the time I was applying to full time data science positions, I would be competitive with other applicants. Since all the positions are so broad, I've been forced to more or less shotgun my resume out to as many companies as possible, sometimes applying to 20+ jobs a week. Any time I can meet a recruiter face to face, I always get an interview, but since applying online, I haven't gotten to a single first round. 

Is anyone experiencing something similar? I feel like I'm qualified for many of the jobs that I apply for and since they say ""Bachelors required, Masters preferred"" I tend to think I have a believable shot. I've been on this sub long enough to know that finding a data science job nowadays is pretty difficult but if anyone wants to throw me their two cents, I'd be happy to hear it. Sorry for the rant, but thanks for reading.

d9a3o1,The Secret sauce to landing a data science role,"I see tons of posts on here claiming specific technical skills needed to become a data scientist. As someone who conducts interviews, mentors new data scientists, and up-skills analysts and engineers, I wanted to offer my perspective. While I believe it is true that there are certain base technical skills required, I do not believe technical knowledge is what your interviewer is looking for, especially if you've made it to a conversational interview. 

The skills listed are merely talking points. Your interviewer most likely understands that you aren't currently an expert at every skill they question. They are likely interviewing you until they get to skills you are unfamiliar with. How do you respond when you don't know something? Do you admit it, or do you try and cover your competency? Are you defensive or are you curious? This is a continuous learning and feedback role. How have you identified, learned, and implemented a new skill? Are you even passionate about learning or are you obviously chasing titles, prestige, or salary?

They are looking for you to be confident in what you do and do not know. Do you boast algorithms and techniques you can't explain or worse, are you arrogant or elitist? Quickly in this role you will be presented with extremely ambiguous requirements. How comfortable are you with this ambiguity and how can you adapt or learn what is necessary to overcome and move forward with development? Will the team risk failure because you didn't speak up about your ability? Do you seek perfection and risk analysis paralysis, or do you iterate and experiment quickly? Are you someone who is a joy to mentor, support, and watch grow? Grit, growth oriented, self-aware, and an open-mind are qualities I consider essential. 

With the right mindset and support, the technical skills are not difficult to learn, especially with the pace of evolving tools. It's an investment the company should be knowingly willing too make. This mindset is what is hard to train for. 

Hope my advice helps. Good luck!",540,67,mathmagician9,2019-09-25 21:47:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/d9a3o1/the_secret_sauce_to_landing_a_data_science_role/,0,datascience

uhirub,"Has anyone ""inherited"" a pipeline/code/model that was so poorly written they wanted to quit their job?","I'm working on picking up a machine learning pipeline that someone else has written. Here's a summary of what I'm dealing with:

* Pipeline is ~50 Python scripts, split across two computers. The pipeline requires bouncing back and forth between both computers (part GPU, part CPU; this can eventually be fixed). 
* There is no automation - each script was previously being invoked by individual commands.
* There is no organization. The script names are things like ""step_1_b_run_before"" ""step_1_preprocess_a"".
* There is no versioning, and there are different versions in multiple users' shared directories.
* The pipeline relies on about 60 dependencies, with no `requirements` files. Dependencies are split between pypi, conda, and individual githubs. Some dependencies need to be old versions (from 2016, for example).
* The scripts dump their output files in whatever directory they are run in, flooding the working directory with intermediate files and outputs.
* Some python scripts are run to generate bash files, which then need to be run to execute other python scripts. It's like a Rube Goldberg machine.
* Lots of commented out code; no comments or documentation
* The person who wrote this is a terrible coder. Anti-patterns galore, code smell (an understatement), copy/pasted segments, etc.
* There are no tests written. At some points, the pipeline errors out and/or generates empty files. I've managed to work around this by disabling certain parts of the pipeline.
* The person who wrote all this has left, and anyone who as run it previously does not really want to help
* I can't even begin to verify the accuracy of any of the results since I'm overwhelmed by simply trying to get it to run as intended

So the gist is that this company does not do code review of any sort, and the consequence is that some pipelines are pristine, and some do not function at all. My boss says ""don't spend too much time on it"" -- i.e. he seems to be telling me he wants results, but doesn't want to deal with the mountain of technical debt that has accrued in this project.

Anyway, I have NO idea what to do here. Obviously management doesn't care about maintainability in the slightest, but I just started this job and don't want to leave the wrong impression or go right back to the job market if I can avoid it.

10ivzyj,my DS experience at Amazon,"My 2.5 year stint at Amazon ended this week and I wanted to write about my experience there, primarily as a personal reflection but also sharing hoping it might be an interesting read here.. also curious to hear few other experiences in other companies.

i came up with 5 points that I found were generally interesting looking back or where I learned something useful.

1. Working with non-technical stakeholders- about 70% of my interactions was with product/program teams. remember feeling overwhelmed in those initial onboarding 1:1s while being bombarded with acronyms and product jargon. it took me 2 months to get up to speed.  one of the things you learn quickly is understanding their goal helps you do your job better.  
My first project was comparing the user experience for a new product that was under development to replace a legacy product, and the product team wanted to confirm that certain key metrics did favor the new product and reflect it’s intended benefits. Given my new-hire energy/naivete, I did lots of in-depth research (even bought Pearl’s causal inference book), spent weekends reading/thinking about it and finally drafted a publication-quality document detailing causal graphs, mediation modeling, hypothesis tests etc etc…. On the day, I go into the meeting expecting an invigorating discussion of my analysis.. only to see the PMs gloss over all that detail and move straight to discussing what the delta-metric meant for them. my action item from that meeting was to draft a 1-pager with key findings to distribute among leadership. I clearly remember my reaction after that meeting- *that was it?*

2. Leadership principles - Granted this is my first tech experience, but I always presumed a company’s marketing material is sufficiently decoupled from its daily operations to the point where the vision/mission/culture code doesn’t actually propagate to your desk. but leadership principles at amazon are genuinely used as guide-markers for daily decision making. I would encounter an LP being the basis of a doc section, meeting discussion or piece of employee feedback almost every week. One benefit for example, is the template it provides for evaluating candidates after job interviews.

3. Writing is greatly valued practice at Amazon, and considered a forcing function for clarity of thought. I saw the benefits from writing my own docs but more so in reading other people’s docs. its also way more efficient by allowing multiple threads of comments/feedback to happen in parallel during the reading session vs a QnA session with a few people hogging all the time. On a related note, i wondered on multiple occasions how senior execs enjoy their work given all they do is read docs all day with super-human efficiency (not that they read the whole doc of-course but still..).

4. self-marketing and finding good projects - this was one of those vague truths that nobody will tell you but everyone slowly realizes esp in big companies, or atleast was true in my case. Every person needs to look after their own career progression by finding good projects, surround themselves with the right people (starting with manager) and of-course deliver the actual work. it might be easy to only focus on 3 believing 1 and 2 are out of control but i feel they’re equally important. example- one of my active contribution areas was for a product that, somewhere along the way, got pushed to a sister org, but I was wedged deep into the inner-workings that they had me continue working on it throughout my time. At the time, I felt important to be irreplaceable but what it really meant was that this work was not aligned with MY org's goals. doh! guess which org’s metrics will mean more to your perf review panel come the end of the year.

5. more projects are self-initiated than i realized. piggy-backing on the previous point about good projects- there is lesser well-thought-through strategy around you than it seems but also more opportunity to find the projects that interest you with potential for outsized impact. example- my most impactful project was a self-initiated one launched to production with a definitively large impact on the product metrics... and it didn't begin as an ‘over-the-line’ item (i.e. planned in the quarterly planning cycle) with a dedicated PM, roadmaps etc. it was just me finding an inefficiency and building a solution and even got it published in an internal conference. this may not be ideal but shows its possible to find areas for impact.   
I also know of at-least 2 other self-initiated projects that evolved to be core to the org’s efforts. This aligns with why companies hold hackathons, google has its 20%-time allowance etc. it also makes you wonder, how much of the OKR, OP, 3YAP etc are actually driving innovation vs designed to create an artificial sense of planning. (jargon expansion- objective key results, operational planning, 3 year action plan)

that's it. for me, this was a rewarding experience and grateful for the people I got to work with. I hope some of this useful to some of you folks, especially to junior data scientists, or an interesting read at the least.

zby4e4,Hot take: Kaggle for entry level CVs is very mid-2010s. Here's what I'd do instead.,"Kaggle can be fun, but don't do it because you think it'll land you a job---that strategy has peaked and the noise is too high. People don't want to know you can apply some canned ML to a canned problem, and the frontiers of ML research is deep into AI at this point, to the point where it's just straight up a different career. What'd I suggest instead is practice asking questions and finding answers, which for this purpose should be as eye catching as possible. 

Download some city data and make a hilariously detailed plan for how to get good parking. Good can mean the cheapest or you can really have fun and try to optimize getting free parking at the risk of getting fined. Really learn about the domain, like be able to explain why it looks different on weekends because they allow alternate side parking or something. Bonus points for driving to the city and trying it out for real. Explain why your model's oversimplified.

This is just an example. IMHO it gets more to the heart of what data science really is today.",534,53,apoplexiglass,2022-12-04 02:35:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/zby4e4/hot_take_kaggle_for_entry_level_cvs_is_very/,0,datascience
szluwh,Working with data scientists that are...lacking statistical skill,"Do many of you work with folks that are billed as data scientists that can't...like...do much statistical analysis?

Where I work, I have some folks that report to me. I think they are great at what they do (I'm clearly biased).

I also work with teams that have 'data scientists' that don't have the foggiest clue about how to interpret any of the models they create, don't understand what models to pick, and seem to just beat their code against the data until a 'good' value comes out.

They talk about how their accuracies are great but their models don't outperform a constant model by 1 point (the datasets can be very unbalanced). This is a literal example. I've seen it more than once.

I can't seem to get some teams to grasp that confusion matrices are important - having more false negatives than true positives can be bad in a high stakes model. It's not always, to be fair, but in certain models it certainly can be.

And then they race to get it into production and pat themselves on the back for how much money they are going to save the firm and present to a bunch of non-technical folks who think that analytics is amazing.

mhh5zu,"Why you're ""bored"" at your job (and how to fix it)","This is a post especially relevant for those of you transitioning into data science from a non-traditional background - so I hope you find it especially helpful :)

In the 1950s, Frederick Herzberg developed a theory that states there are two dimensions to job satisfaction: motivation and hygiene. 

Hygiene factors can minimize dissatisfaction at work, but they can’t make you love your job. These are factors like salary, supervision, and working conditions.

When you look back at the best moments of your career, they won’t really include the perks or the free lunches you got.

Instead, you’ll look back and remember the *motivators*. These are factors like recognition and achievement. They mean that your work is challenging and that you’re learning about topics that you’re intrinsically interested in. 

These are the factors that’ll be the predominant source of your work satisfaction and what contribute to your personal growth.

Here’s the thing though. If the hygiene areas aren’t properly addressed, you won’t feel satisfied regardless of how fulfilling your work is.

No matter how challenging and exciting your work is, if you’re not getting paid what you deserve, you’ll constantly have a nagging thought at the back of your head telling you to leave.

On the other hand, *only* having hygiene areas resolved is the reason why you constantly think something’s missing. You’re puzzled over *why* you’d be unhappy - you have a high status job, plenty of cash, and great coworkers.

But we need challenge and growth to drive us forward. And that’s why the motivators are integral. Without the motivators, we go to bed at night dreaming about what we’d be doing in an alternative world. Just look at these Hacker News posts ([link](https://preview.redd.it/ed99k3mjsfq61.png?width=2360&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3d640a23b0b37726ffdb4a3a5cc872601eae7f9)). 

The reason this can be hard to identify in our day to day is because we wrongly assume that just because we’re not fully unsatisfied, we must be satisfied. And when we inevitably don’t get that resounding feeling of congruence with our work, we get puzzled.

One of my favorite examples of someone who prioritized her intrinsic motivators over factors like money or status is [Kristina Lustig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristinalustig/). She quit her high paying Director of Design job to retrain as a Software Developer.

It might not have made sense to others around her, but only Kristina knew what motivated her intrinsically.

**Loss Aversion**

Let’s assume you realize you want to make a career change into something more rewarding. Your brain is going to freak out.

It’s going to start screaming:

* What if I don’t like my new job as much as my current one?
* What if I don’t end up happier?
* I can’t change if i don’t make as much money.

The key to overcome this thinking is to *separate short term losses from long term losses.*

So here are a few examples:

* **Short Term**: In the short term, my salary will drop. **Long Term**: But 5 years from now, why can't it exceed what I'm making right now?
* **Short Term:** I might have to take an entry level role which feels like a big drop from my current position. **Long Term**: But 5 years from now, won't I not only be in a more senior position but also a few steps closer to doing work I enjoy?
* **Short Term**: I might have to give up the stability of my current role. **Long Term**: But 5 years from now, won't I have stability and a new skillset I can leverage?

**The Next Thing**

It’s really easy to fall into the trap of thinking that the nicer office, the next pay raise, or the more prestigious title is what will make us happy. After all, it’s what your friends and family see. It’s the labels that stick.

Instead, we should aim to ask a different set of questions:

* Is this work meaningful to me?
* Is this job going to give me a chance to develop?
* Am I going to learn new things?
* Will I have an opportunity for recognition and achievement?
* Am I going to be given responsibility?

These are the things that will truly motivate you. The rest is just noise.

vtd6ln,The Data Science Trap,"It is no longer open to question that data scientists in the industry are merely glorified data analysts. Businesses are pouring money into STEM graduates to create colorful charts and BS reporting. Aside from hypothesis testing and linear or logistic regressions, nothing they do comes close to statistics or modeling. There have been several threads about how research scientists are the new data scientists - and these threads are full of scorn for the state of the data scientist job market. 

Now, I'm finding that some places require doctorates in statistics, computer science, physics, and math - all for the same data analytics role. Don't get me wrong: data analytics is an important part of running a business, but that work isn't fully utilizing the capabilities of the fields listed above. This is what I call the data science trap.

Unfortunately, a quick LinkedIn search and a quick search of alumni from top departments at top schools reveal several who end up working as data scientists at firms notorious for hiring data scientists to be SQL monkeys. 

I've already learned to recognize phony job descriptions for data analysts masquerading as data scientist positions. But I'm curious how one avoids the data science trap, especially for those with a graduate degree.",532,231,alberto-matamoro,2022-07-07 07:54:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/vtd6ln/the_data_science_trap/,0,datascience

xxmctx,Predatory Data Science IT Companies,"I don't post often on Reddit, but I feel the need to speak out about a recent experience.

I'm a recent grad, May of 2021 with a B.A in Data Science & Statistics (it's an applied math degree). Although I'm a new grad, I'm fortunate to have 1.5 years of professional experience as a data analyst, spanning one internship and two contract roles. However, I am trying to get my foot in the door as a Data Scientist, and am currently participating in an Applied Data Science Program in lieu of a master's (I have my own philosophy of getting a master's degree AKA its too much money and I'd rather use all available resources at my disposal first)

Anywho, the market has been a bit tough in NYC, as I've been unemployed for the last 4 months. I've had countless interviews, final rounds, but the last role eventually gets passed along to another candidate. I'm a good sport about it- until I was contacted by an IT company called Synergistic IT.

They had an entry-level Data Scientist role that I measly applied to. After swiftly scheduling an interview, the day of our phone interview came. It felt rushed, and wasn't very technical. The person over the phone eventually came to describe that this is not a paid role, but rather a service that ""trains"" you until you find a data science role, and that they're a valid IT company that they will allow you to add to your resume. Also, you had to pay for it.

It felt cheap, and my scam radar went off. So I decided to play bait and ask how much it was. The ""interviewer"" became visibly upset when I expressed a level of shock when he told me it was \~$15,000. As I quickly informed him that I was not interested, he tried to get me on the phone and associate my lack of experience in data science to why I cannot enter data science.

""You don't have experience, right? So you pay us, we give you experience, then when your job comes, you will be ok""

I'm sure there's plenty of reasons why I don't have a data science job (yet). But I'm sure by the way this ""interview"" was conducted, this opportunity was nothing more than to exploit new grads with little experience by offering ""experience"". 

Has anyone come across these companies? Any advice for new grads entering data science?",526,91,naz115,2022-10-07 01:44:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/xxmctx/predatory_data_science_it_companies/,0,datascience

q0n0u7,Just recently turned in my two weeks notice as an analyst,"Because after a few years of constantly learning and working hard as an analyst, I have accepted a new position as a data scientist at a different company!

My first job was at a small startup-ish company was very new to wanting to use data to drive decision making. The original analyst they had copy-pasted CSVs by hand did everything in Excel pivot tables. I was fresh out of college with my applied math degree, and after 130+ applications I was happy to finally get a job. After learning more about the data this company worked with, I decided there has to be a better way, and I would power through the process. The true thing my undergraduate degree really taught me how to do was break down daunting problems into achievable steps and how to google the right questions, and it was now time to put that to the test.


Taking what measly bit of Python I knew, I started doing things like combining data in pandas and creating analyses in python to allow the data to scale past Excel's limitations. Once I had a working product, I always researched how I could write more efficient code. It took a lot of StackExchange and pandas documentation reading, always trying to learn new processes and techniques. Now I consider myself a data wrangling expert and confident in my Python skills. 

It wasn't an easy road and it really depends on the work you're willing to put into it. There were many times I wanted to give up, let up on the gas and just coast for awhile. But I knew I had to keep going if I wanted to become a data scientist. All the struggles I dealt with, the extremely messy data, researching new techniques to visualize and analyze data extremely helped me get through the interviews and prove I was up for the job at hand - and finally receive that sweet, sweet offer letter.

I also wanted to say thank you because this subreddit has helped me a lot. I don't frequently submit and comment, but reading many different posts and comments has greatly helped me on my career journey. I am just excited and wanted to tell people about it.

Random note: My boss is very upset with me after I told him in a meeting and handed in my resignation letter.

10v75gc,Be careful with AI influencers marketing themself as data scientists or data experts,"On LinkedIn I see more and more people labeling them as data scientists, AI experts and what-not offering paid courses, interview training and resume review. Often, they have a non-data-science background and very little experience working as a professional. Quite common to show a previous job as a data scientist with a tenure less than 1 year (or multiple).

I know it can be appealing, as their message is often, everyone can be a data scientist, machine learning engineer or AI expert. Academic and professional degrees are overrated and it’s enough to take a Udemy or Coursera course to become a data scientist (affiliate link included). Simply follow them and buy their resources (which is usually very general advice, you can google in a few minutes).

But the reality is: They are usually not the experts they pretend to be. They typically don’t talk about expert topics, they talk about career, current hypes, and about very high-level projects. Sometimes they have a GitHub account, but they have no commits of just copy-pasted repositories from other people and some very basic entry-level stuff. They are usually on LinkedIn, Instagram, and YouTube and in podcasts, but never talking about expert topics.

Don’t trust these people and don’t buy courses there. Everything you need is either free of charge or it’s a professional degree. There is no easy-going way to become an expert in any topic. The only good advice these people can give is how to become a fake AI influencer.

r540ko,Completed 48hr take home assessment over the weekend. Rejected top of the morning on Monday.,"Feeling so drained.

Start-up gave me a small-ish .db file to make a report and answer some basic questions. The data seemed like a simple subset of their real data, and was definitely geared for a BI type of role. Admittedly my SQL was a little rusty, but I got some quick exploratory visualizations done day 1, pondered about analysis for a day, then completed it along with a powerpoint the next day. It probably should have taken a few hours, but I invested maybe 8-10 total as I'm coming from a straight bio PhD with no work experience.

I know I'm not a superstar, but I didn't think it was half-bad for a rush job. Didn't seem to matter though, as I was rejected by 10AM local time Monday morning. I was gobsmacked and asked at least for a little feedback, not that I'm owed. Crickets so far, and not really expecting to hear back.

Anyway, what are people's feeling on these types of things? On the one hand, it's bollocks that I'm basically working for free, and the other I'm desperately in need of work and unfortunately I am willing to jump through these hoops to land a job.

**EDIT:** Given the amount of attention this post got, I'm going to anonymize some of the details and post the problem, presentation, and code on a blog-style format then post again here. Hopefully it will be a learning experience for me at best, and just be more practice for novices at worst.",511,192,Mother_Drenger,2021-11-29 19:52:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/r540ko/completed_48hr_take_home_assessment_over_the/,0,datascience

sx9o1g,I no longer believe that an MS in Statistics is an appropriate route for becoming a Data Scientist.,"When I was working as a data scientist (with a BS), I believed somewhat strongly that Statistics was the proper field for training to become a data scientist--not computer science, not data science, not analytics. Statistics. 

However, now that I'm doing a statistics MS, my perspective has completely flipped. Much of what we're learning is *completely* useless for private sector data science, from my experience. So much pointless math for the sake of math. Incredibly tedious computations. Complicated proofs of irrelevant theorems. Psets that require 20 hours or more to complete, simply because the computations are so intense (page-long integrals, etc.). What's the point?

There's basically no working with data. How can you train in statistics without working with real data? There's no real world value to any of this. My skills as a data scientist/applied statistician are not improving. 

Maybe not all stats programs are like this, but wow, I sure do wish I would've taken a different route.",506,173,randoma1231vd,2022-02-20 19:50:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/sx9o1g/i_no_longer_believe_that_an_ms_in_statistics_is/,0,datascience

u3jk05,YSK: Your LinkedIn usage patterns affect how many recruiters reach out to you.,"It seems obvious that LinkedIn would try to give recruiters the best possible leads. I think 2 features they use to rank candidates for recruiters are 1) how frequently the profile responds to recruiter messages, and 2) if you've used LinkedIn to apply for jobs. Other possible features might be how much you've used the site in general, and whether you've selected specific job titles you're interested in. I'd be interested to hear if others' experiences align. 

 My experience: when I first set myself as ""open to work"" on LinkedIn (only for recruiters, not publicly in my profile), I wasn't getting many recruiter messages, and the ones I did get were pretty low quality.  I still always responded to them pretty quickly with a rejection. Now, a few months later, I'm getting hit every day by a new recruiter, and the jobs are actually pretty relevant and interesting. Why the change?

I think LinkedIn tracks whether a profile responds to recruiter messages, and prioritizes profiles that communicate well with recruiters. 

Additionally, I recently started applying to some jobs on LinkedIn, whereas before I was just using Indeed. I think that has also increased how ""active"" LinkedIn considers me, and boosts me in recruiter searches. 

TLDR: if you want quality recruiters in your inbox, respond to the bad ones, and maybe submit a few applications through LinkedIn.",504,67,senorgraves,2022-04-14 15:02:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/u3jk05/ysk_your_linkedin_usage_patterns_affect_how_many/,0,datascience

g20x47,100-days Data Science Challenge!,"One month ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fisj71/from_economics_to_data_science/) about starting my curriculum for DS/ML and got lots of great advice, suggestions, and feedback. Through this month I have not skipped a single day and I plan to continue my streak for 100 days. Also, I made some changes in my ""curriculum"" and wanted to provide some updates and feedback on my experience. There's tons of information and resources out there and it's really easy to get overwhelmed (Which I did before I came up with this plan), so maybe this can help others to organize better and get started.

&#x200B;

**Math:**

* Linear Algebra:
   * Udemy course:  [Become a Linear Algebra Master](https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-algebra-course/)
   * Book: [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Undergraduate-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B00PULZWPC)
   * YouTube: [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

I've been doing exercises from the book mainly but the Udemy course helps to explain some topics which seem confusing in the book. 3Blue1Brown YT is a great supplement as it helps to visualize all the concepts which are massive for understanding topics and application of the Linear algebra. I'm through 2/3 of the class and it already helps a lot with statistics part so it's must-do if you have not learned linear algebra before  


* **Statistical Learning**
   * Book: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/data.html)
   * YouTube 1: [Data Science Analytics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB2p-jaoolkv0h22m4I9l9Q/videos)
   * YouTube 2: [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw)

ITSL is a great introductory book and I'm halfway through. Well explained with great examples, lab works and exercises. The book uses R but as a part of python practice, I'm reproducing all the lab works and exercises in Python. Usually, it's challenging but I learn way more doing this. (If you'll need python codes for this book's lab works let me know and I can share) The DSA YT channel just follows the ITSL chapter by chapter so it's a great way to read the book make notes and watch their videos simultaneously. StatQuest is an alternative YT channel that explains ML concepts clearly. After I'm done with ITSL I plan to continue with a more [advanced book from the same authors](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)  


**Programming**:

* I use the Dataquest Data Science path and usually, I do one-two missions per day. The program is well-structured and gives what you will need at the job, but has a small number of exercises. So when you learn something it's a good idea to get some data and practice on it. 
* Udemy: [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/learn/lecture/6453704?start=0#overview)
   * I use their videos after I finish the chapter in ITSL to see how t code regressions etc. But their explanation of statistics behind models is limited and vague. Anyway, a good tutorial for coding
* Book: [Think Python](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Python-Like-Computer-Scientist-ebook/dp/B018UXJ9EQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NDPR8R8GRQ8N&dchild=1&keywords=think+python&qid=1586982845&s=digital-text&sprefix=think+python%2Cdigital-text%2C139&sr=1-1)
   * Good intro book in python. I know the majority of concepts from this book but exercises are sweet and here and there I encounter some new topic.
* Leetcode/Hackerrank
   * Mainly for SQL practice. I spend around 40 minutes to 1 hour per day (usually 5 days per week). I can solve 70-80% of easy questions on my own. Plan to move to mediums when I'm done with Dataquest specialization.
* Projects:
   * Nothin massive yet. Mainly trying to collect, clean and organize data. Lots of you suggested getting really good at it, as usual, that's what entry-level analysts do so here I am. After a couple of days, I'm returning to my previous code to see where I can make my code more readable. Where I can replace lines of code with function not to be redundant and make more reusable code. And of course, asking for feedback. It amazes me how completely unknown people can take their time to give you comprehensive and thorough feedback! 

&#x200B;

I spend 4-5 hours minimum every day on the listed activities. I'm recording time when I actually study because it helps me to reduce the noise (scrolling on Reddit, FB, Linkedin, etc.). I'm doing 25-minute cycles (25 minutes uninterrupted study than a 5-minute break). At the end of the day, I'm writing a summary of what I learned during that day and what is the plan for the next day. These practices help a lot to stay organized and really stick to the plan. On the lazy days, I'm just reminding myself how bad I will feel If I skip the day and break the streak and how much gratification I will receive If I complete the challenge. That keeps me motivated. Plus material is really captivating for me and that's another stimulus. 

What can be a good way to improve my coding, stats or math? any books, courses, or practice will you recommend continuing my journey?

Any questions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome and encouraged! :D",498,66,Hellr0x,2020-04-15 21:14:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/g20x47/100days_data_science_challenge/,0,datascience
ckdnkf,Recruiting (Still) Ain’t Easy: Job Hunting as a Senior Data Scientist,"There are a whole lot of resources out there discussing how to get your first job in data science, but relatively few about getting that second, third, and fourth job once you’ve finally broken in and paid your dues. To that end, I thought I’d share some statistics and commentary about my most recent job search.

Background: Based out of New York. MS in Statistics, 4+ years in data science proper at 2 different companies, a few years in related quant roles before that.

Current company: a fairly large org in a traditional industry, currently trying to rebrand itself as a tech company, with mixed results so far. Despite our best efforts, data science hasn’t really found its place yet, and probably never will. That was the main reason for my job search.

&#x200B;

The Numbers:

131: companies I applied to, using a mix of online apps, recruiters, and referrals/networking

77: initial callbacks

7: companies I applied to twice and got an interview on the second try

25: take home assignments or HackerRank challenges I was asked to complete

8: take homes I actually did

9: whiteboard or coderpad sessions

5: whiteboard sessions I totally fucked up

18: onsites I was invited to

12: onsites I actually went to

4: times I was ghosted after a final round onsite

42: hours I spent onsite

3: offers I ended up getting

5: months it took from initial round of apps to finally accepting an offer

100: the lowest base salary I was quoted (in thousands)

195: the highest base salary I was quoted

160: the median base salary

&#x200B;

The Aftermath:

Yes, it’s a lot easier to get interviews and callbacks when you’ve already got a data science job. That’s the good news. I don’t even consider myself a great data scientist, I’m probably 70th percentile at best. My GitHub is empty except for 1 side project I did 3 years ago. I don’t write cover letters. My professional network consists of lawyers and vagabonds. Turns out that’s enough! I turned down quite a number of interview requests and next steps. These were the most common reasons:

\-low pay

\-job was essentially product analytics

\-job was essentially software engineering

\-product or industry didn’t interest me

\-team was already quite mature, which makes it less exciting for me

The bad news is that it still takes a while to successfully secure an offer at a company that you actually want to work for. The challenge when you are an experienced candidate is no longer applying to jobs and hoping for a response. The challenge is carving out time (when you already have a day job) to conduct interviews and do take homes, and then hoping that you’re getting good vibes from the manager, the team, and the org at large. You now have the luxury of being picky about where you spend your time.

There are loads of companies who don’t know what they’re doing when it comes to data science or ML, and only a handful that do, while also having an interesting product/challenges and good comp. Everyone knows who those companies are, so everyone who’s good applies to them, and so the competition is still pretty fierce at the highest levels.

Startups vs Enterprise:

There was an interesting split in terms of callbacks by company size and type. I received a grand total of 1 callback from an “enterprise” company. The vast majority of my callbacks were from small-to-mid size companies that could colloquially be described as a “tech startup” or “tech-adjacent”, or through corporate recruiters who made first contact. After a while I stopped even applying to banks, media, insurance companies and any place that used legacy ATS software like Taleo or BrassRing (truly, the black hole of resumes). If they used Lever, Greenhouse or Jobvite instead, then I was golden. It’s funny to think that the course of your career could be so irrevocably shaped by shitty job posting software, but there you go.

Take Homes:

I don’t think anyone I know actively enjoys doing these but they’re apparently the new normal now so you gotta deal with them. The first few I did yielded poor results but over time I hit a nice groove. The key is to comment and explain everything you did (assumptions, reasoning, logic, commentary). My most successful take homes contained roughly the same amount of documentation as actual code.  I used the simplest methods I could because I didn’t want to spend a lot of time on these things, but I made sure to include a mini-report.

Something I Learned:

I eventually realized that the ideal interview process for me would frontload all the technical screening and reserve the onsite for conceptual or high level discussions.  Assign whatever coding screen, stats Q&A or homework you need before bringing someone in.  Ensure that everyone who makes it to your final round has already demonstrated sufficient technical chops.  There's nothing worse for a candidate than carving out a 4 hour chunk of time away from work, then showing up to someone's office just to flunk a whiteboard code sesh at the very top of the morning...and then having to interview for another 3 hours.  All it takes is one mistake and it could torpedo your chances.

Networking (bonus edit):

The thing with networking is that it works really well when it happens.  It's how I got one of my previous jobs: pretty much walked in for coffee and walked out with an offer.  Unfortunately, it's not a magic button you can just press when you need it.  There are a finite supply of senior DS jobs out there,, so you can't rely on it every time you need a change of scenery.  Definitely would recommend meeting people, getting your name out there, etc, but realize that it's more of a long term play than anything else.

Most Embarrassing/Annoying Moments (another bonus edit):

\-forgot how to write a window function

\-interviewer didn't believe common table expressions were valid SQL.  They totally are.

\-couldn't solve a string compression problem quickly/efficiently enough

\-blanked out on a binary search tree problem

\-couldn't quite explain how L1 regularization induces sparsity

\-""What is your greatest weakness?""  Seriously?

\-ghosted by the same company twice.  Fool me once...",494,153,unsteady_panda,2019-07-31 20:05:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ckdnkf/recruiting_still_aint_easy_job_hunting_as_a/,1,datascience
lbr2fb,Networking - it's not just LinkedIn connections,"I was chatting with someone here in the sub about LinkedIn, and it made me realize something that I don't think gets discussed in enough detail when talking about job searches: ""networking"".

Most people will (correctly) tell you that networking is the best way to find a job. What most people don't tell you is that not all networking is the same, and not all networking is useful.

For example, I've had at least 1 or 2 fresh grads send me connection requests on LinkedIn asking me for a job for the last like 4 years. Most of the time I'm nice, I accept their request and tell them I unfortunately can't help them.

Technically speaking, these people have ""grown"" their network. Practically speaking, they have not *because there is no actual relationship there*. That is, unless you can create a point of contact *and then use it to create a relationship*, then that is not a real connection. 

So going on LinkedIn and shooting off random connection requests to a bunch of people you don't know and then asking them for jobs isn't going to help you. It's like a 0.001% chance of it having any impact in your job search.

Let's pause for a second and touch on an important topic while we're here: what is the goal of networking when you're looking for a job? It's not ""to get a job"". I want to make this clear: a connection isn't likely going to get you a job. They aren't even likely to get you an interview. The only thing that you should be expecting from a connection is that instead of your resume comingling with the 100s or 1000s of resumes submitted for a role you're interested in, that your resume will be almost surely one of the ones that gets looked at closely. That's it. After that, it's all you - you need to make sure your resume is spectacular, you need to interview well, etc. 

Yes, every once in a while you'll hit a home run and have someone in your network that is literally the hiring manager for a role you want (or has a real close relationship with someone in your network) and then you may be able to jump to the front of the line and go straight to an interview. But that is extremely rare.

Ok back to the original question: how do you network? I would say there are three things you need to focus on:

1. Strengthening/exploring your existing network of real connections (not fake social media ones): family, friends, classmates, professors, etc. People that you actually know and who, in turn, would have at least some predisposition to do nice things for you if you asked them to. If you're in the job market, the first thing you should do is reach out to people in this bubble that may have connections to the industry - and even if you don't think they do, ask. 
2. Finding 2nd degree connections on LinkedIn and having your common connection broker a conversation *that has a purpose*. A 2nd degree connection on LinkedIn is someone who shares a connection with you. So, say you're interested in a job at Company X, and you find that your college roommate is connected to Anne, a recruiter for Company X. You then ask your roommate ""hey, do you know Anne personally? If so, would you mind introducing me to her - I am very interested in their company and would like to see if I could be a good fit for a specific role they have. Also, if you can say some nice things about me that would be cool"". Or if you find a Data Analyst in a company you're interested in that is a common connection with a guy you had a class with, same thing ""Hey Bob, I see that Janet works at a company I'm interested in. If you know her personally, would you be willing to broker a conversation between the two of us? I'd like to get her opinion on whether I am qualified for X job at her company"".
3. Connecting with people with whom you share common interests that are somewhat specific. Say you like building models for fantasy football. There is a community out there of such people, and given that you already have something in common it is very reasonable to say something like ""hey, I see you too like fantasy football analytics. I have been working on this model that does x, y, z and could really use some feedback - and it looks like you've done similar stuff in the past"". If I am this other person, I am 10X more likely to reply to that and engage than I am to ""will you be my connection? I need a job"".",494,76,dfphd,2021-02-03 16:14:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/lbr2fb/networking_its_not_just_linkedin_connections/,0,datascience

16x6t1p,My F100 company analyzed why our good data scientists are good and here's the recap,"A small team of internal researchers inside the company spent time investigating which data scientists preformed the best, which preformed the worst, and what factors played into this. 

The top 3 indicators of a high preforming data scientist were:
1. The number one predictor of a preformant data scientist was proactive communication. Be it speaking up in meetings, pinging people in chat, voicing concerns with a work plan, these data scientists communicated on their own initiative and their ability to get things done and make an impact is recognized. 
2. They are capable of flushing out requirements and working on complicated tasks without managerial intervention. A good example of this could be manager says we need to build a model that satisfies xyz objectives and that there are additional business reqs we'll need to flush out. 2 or 3 data scientists go do all the work to get the data and flush out the requirments while making all the plans amongst themselves and basically just keeping the manager in the loop on what's happening. 
3. They focus on adding value over pursuing technical solutions. Often times the simpler modeling approach is good enough and it solves the problem in a quick fashion. 


Things noted about low preforming data scientists were:
1. They were reactive in their communication
2. They often times missed deadlines that they themselves set and never communicated that there were issues or that the deadline would be missed. 
3. They often focus on tasks like attending all of their meetings or immediatly responding to emails rather than meeting project goals and deadlines
4. They focus too much on perfecting the POC solution which later leads to a lot of rework / wasted time.
5. They're overly dismissive in their communication. Weather it be asking for feedback and validation and then disregarding it when it doesn't align with their ideas or simply dismissing the ideas of others in general. 
6. They create drama.",491,177,None,2023-10-01 17:15:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16x6t1p/my_f100_company_analyzed_why_our_good_data/,0,datascience

Mathematical Foundations

These courses are intended to help lay the foundation for learning more advanced maths, as well as foster the development of mathematical thinking. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Introduction to Logic, Stanford (course)
This course is an introduction to Logic from a computational perspective. It shows how to encode information in the form of logical sentences; it shows how to reason with information in this form; and it provides an overview of logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.

Introduction to Mathematical Thinking, Stanford (course)
Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.

High School Mathematics, MIT (collection of courses)
In this section we have provided a collection of mathematics courses and resources from across MIT. Some are materials that were used to teach MIT undergraduates, while others were designed specifically for high school students.

Statistics & Probability

Statistics and probability are the foundations of data science, more so than any other family of mathematical concepts. These courses will help prepare you to look at data through the statistical lens and with a critical probabilistic eye. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Statistics and probability, Khan Academy (course)
Course covers analyzing categorical data, displaying and comparing quantitative data, summarizing quantitative data, modeling data distributions, exploring bivariate numerical data, study design, probability, counting, permutations, and combinations, random variables, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, significance tests, two-sample inference for the difference between groups, inference for categorical data, advanced regression, analysis of variance

Fundamentals of Statistics, MIT (course)
Statistics is the science of turning data into insights and ultimately decisions. Behind recent advances in machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence are fundamental statistical principles. The purpose of this class is to develop and understand these core ideas on firm mathematical grounds starting from the construction of estimators and tests, as well as an analysis of their asymptotic performance

Data Science: Probability, Harvard (course)
We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. These statistical concepts are fundamental to conducting statistical tests on data and understanding whether the data you are analyzing is likely occurring due to an experimental method or to chance.

Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data, MIT (course)
The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including: multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions, laws of large numbers, the main tools of Bayesian inference methods, an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains)

Improving your statistical inferences, Eindhoven University of Technology (course)
First, we will discuss how to correctly interpret p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, Bayes Factors, and likelihood ratios, and how these statistics answer different questions you might be interested in. Then, you will learn how to design experiments where the false positive rate is controlled, and how to decide upon the sample size for your study, for example in order to achieve high statistical power. Subsequently, you will learn how to interpret evidence in the scientific literature given widespread publication bias, for example by learning about p-curve analysis. Finally, we will talk about how to do philosophy of science, theory construction, and cumulative science, including how to perform replication studies, why and how to pre-register your experiment, and how to share your results following Open Science principles.

Introduction to Probability and Data, Duke University (course)
This course introduces you to sampling and exploring data, as well as basic probability theory and Bayes' rule. You will examine various types of sampling methods, and discuss how such methods can impact the scope of inference. A variety of exploratory data analysis techniques will be covered, including numeric summary statistics and basic data visualization. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The concepts and techniques in this course will serve as building blocks for the inference and modeling courses in the Specialization.

Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics, Penn State (course)
Courseware for a pair of related courses covers introduction to probability, discrete distributions, continuous distributions, bivariate distributions, ditributions of functions of random variables, estimation, hypothesis testing, nonparametric methods, bayesian methods, and more.

 
Mathematics for Data Science & Machine Learning

These are mathematics topics directly related to data science and machine learning. They may include material from courses above, and may also be more elementary than some of above as well. However, they can be useful for brushing up on material you may not have studied in a while, and which is especially pertinent to the practice of data science. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Data Science Math Skills, Duke University (course)
Data science courses contain math—no avoiding that! This course is designed to teach learners the basic math you will need in order to be successful in almost any data science math course and was created for learners who have basic math skills but may not have taken algebra or pre-calculus. Data Science Math Skills introduces the core math that data science is built upon, with no extra complexity, introducing unfamiliar ideas and math symbols one-at-a-time.

Essential Math for Machine Learning: Python Edition, Microsoft (course)
This course is not a full math curriculum; it's not designed to replace school or college math education. Instead, it focuses on the key mathematical concepts that you'll encounter in studies of machine learning. It is designed to fill the gaps for students who missed these key concepts as part of their formal education, or who need to refresh their memories after a long break from studying math.

Mathematics for Machine Learning, Imperial College London (specialization)
For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how it’s used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.",491,21,None,2020-03-22 22:58:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fn9414/free_mathematics_courses_for_data_science_machine/,0,datascience

16dk5b6,R vs Python - detailed examples from proficient bilingual programmers,"As an academic, R was a priority for me to learn over Python. Years later, I always see people saying ""Python is a general-purpose language and R is for stats"", but I've never come across a single programming task that couldn't be completed with extraordinary efficiency in R. I've used R for everything from big data analysis (tens to hundreds of GBs of raw data), machine learning, data visualization, modeling, bioinformatics, building interactive applications, making professional reports, etc.

Is there any truth to the dogmatic saying that ""Python is better than R for general purpose data science""? It certainly doesn't appear that way on my end, but **I would love some specifics for how Python beats R in certain categories as motivation to learn the language.** For example, if R is a statistical language and machine learning is rooted in statistics, how could Python possibly be any better for that?",487,145,Every-Eggplant9205,2023-09-08 19:45:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16dk5b6/r_vs_python_detailed_examples_from_proficient/,0,datascience

I recently went on a work trip and we worked from about 7 am to 10 pm at night most days, taking a dinner break around 5 or 6. 

At dinner one of the nights, the boss starts complaining about an employee who didn’t want to work weekends and starts saying the 40 hour work week is a myth and it’s just reality to have to work more than that so we should just expect it, and our base salary is the compensation (aka, no overtime so basically, telling us to lie on our time sheets).

10m6kpq,I'm a tired of interviewing fresh graduates that don't know fundamentals.,"So I have just wrapped up first round interviews for an open position on my team. I work in banking and most of my career involves building regression or logistic regression models.

One of the trends I've seen since the tech data science boom started is that there just seems to be a drop in the technical level for peoples with masters degree on fundamentals. It seems too many candidates with masters degrees  do not understand mathematical assumptions of most of the models they are using even at a conceptual level.   For example, during the interview I asked most candidates about regression and what assumptions are required.

Nearly every single masters level candidate didn't know why the specific assumptions were made (even if they could correctly list them), could not answer questions on what happens when you violate an assumption, and did not know how to test violation of those assumptions or how to address those issues. Whats disconcerting is these are candidates coming out of professional masters programs from the worlds leading universities and most of them will end up in jobs where modeling error can have multi-million dollar impacts.

For some additional context: The comment here is explicitly here about standard of candidates I interviewed for people with masters degrees. Most of the Ph.D jobs met standards we expect, even though the job does not require one. The job is one that is very specifically related to regression modeling, time series.   


Some clarification: This isn't not having trouble finding candidates post. This is a role at a industry leading firm, and there is no shortage of good candidates.  What I am specifically addressing in this posts is that candidates we are interviewing with masters degrees don't know text book stuff they should know based on whats listed in their resume.

n1wnp6,Disillusioned with the field of data science,"I’ve been in my first data science opportunity for almost a year now and I’m starting to question if I made a mistake entering this field. 

My job is all politics. I’m pulled every which way. I’m constantly interrupted whenever I try to share any ideas. My work is often tossed out. And if I have a good idea, it’s ignored until someone else presents the same idea, then everyone loves it. I’m constantly asked by non-technical people to do things that are incorrect, and when I try to speak up, I’m ignored and my manager doesn’t defend me either. I was promised technical work but I’m stuck working out of excel and PowerPoint while I desperately try to maintain my coding and modeling skills outside of work. 

I’m a woman of color working in a conservative field. I’m exhausted. Is this normal? Do I need to find another field? Are there companies/ types of companies that you recommend I look into that aren’t like this? This isn’t what I thought data science would be.

EDIT: Thank you for the responses everyone! I’ve reached out to some of you privately and will try to respond to everyone else. Based on the comments and some of the suggestions (which were helpful, but already tried), I think it’s time to plan an exit strategy. Being in this environment has led to burnout and mental/physical health is more important than a job. 

To those of you suggesting this as an opportunity to develop soft skills or work on my excel/ppt skills, that’s actually exactly how I pitched it to myself when I first started this role and realized it wouldn’t be as technical as I’d like. But being in an environment like this has actually been detrimental to my soft skills. I’ve lost all confidence in my ability to speak in front of others. And my deck designs are constantly tossed out even after spending hours trying to make them as nice as possible. To anyone else reading this that is experiencing this, you deserve better. You do not have to put up with this in the name of resilience. At a certain point, you are just ramming yourself into a wall over and over again. Others in my organization were getting to work on data science work, so it wasn’t a bait and switch for everyone. Just some of us (coincidentally, all women). 

I’m not going to leave DS yet. I worked too hard to develop these skills to just let them go to waste. But I think an industry change is due.",480,168,Passacagalia,2021-04-30 15:46:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/n1wnp6/disillusioned_with_the_field_of_data_science/,0,datascience

mdlnvy,Everything wrong with Zindi data science competition platform.,"**WARNING:** rant coming

I want to to share my unfortunate experience with Zindi platform. It is a data science competition platform, same as kaggle, but the bounty doesn't usually exceed 2000$, and it is geared more toward African countries.

I participated in a competition there hoping that the company hosting it would hire me if I win. After few weeks I snatched the second place on the leaderboard. I kept slightly improving it for the span of of what's left on the competition. Then, one week before the deadline, I got my account banned.

I opened my email thinking it was some sort of a mistake, I found an email sent by them stating that they banned me under the pretext of ""Collaboration outside of team"". I responded explaining to them that I single handedly worked on the solution of my problem, telling them I'm ready to provide proof if they want. They didn't respond.

Then today, out of sheer luck, I discovered that the team that took my place on the leaderboard when I got banned work as a data scientist for Zindi, which is quite preposterous to say the least.

How can they work in the company and be allowed to participate? Meaning it's in his advantage to ban people who are topping the leaderboard: they eliminate any competition, and they get the money. This explains the very empty, devoid of any logic explanation provided by Zindi as the reason on why they banned me, the such of ""Collaboration outside of team"", without the willingness to elaborate any further, or give sufficient proof, even if my solution out-performs theirs.

It's just insane. I would say stay out of Zindi, it is an unfair community, chances are not equal, and they are not professional. Zindi epitomizes everything wrong with African countries, conflict of interest, lack of respect to people, rentier state, and corruption (ps: I come from an African country).",475,30,maroxtn,2021-03-26 10:29:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mdlnvy/everything_wrong_with_zindi_data_science/,0,datascience

myurtx,The Journey Of Problem Solving Using Analytics,"In my \~6 years of working in the analytics domain, for most of the Fortune 10 clients, across geographies, one thing I've realized is while people may solve business problems using analytics, the journey is lost somewhere. At the risk of sounding cliche, ***'Enjoy the journey, not the destination"".*** So here's my attempt at creating the problem-solving journey from what I've experienced/learned/failed at.

The framework for problem-solving using analytics is a 3 step process. On we go:

1. **Break the business problem into an analytical problem**  
Let's start this with another cliche - *"" If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions"".* This is where a lot of analysts/consultants fail. As soon as a business problem falls into their ears, they straightaway get down to solution-ing, without even a bare attempt at understanding the problem at hand. To tackle this, I (and my team) follow what we call the **CS-FS framework** (extra marks to those who can come up with a better naming).  
The CS-FS framework stands for the Current State - Future State framework.In the CS-FS framework, the first step is to identify the **Current State** of the client, where they're at currently with the problem, followed by the next step, which is to identify the **Desired Future State**, where they want to be after the solution is provided - the insights, the behaviors driven by the insight and finally the outcome driven by the behavior.  
The final, and the most important step of the CS-FS framework is **to identify the gap**, that prevents the client from moving from the Current State to the Desired Future State. This becomes your Analytical Problem, and thus the input for the next step
2. **Find the Analytical Solution to the Analytical Problem**  
Now that you have the business problem converted to an analytical problem, let's look at the data, shall we? \*\*A BIG NO!\*\*  
We will start forming hypotheses around the problem, **WITHOUT BEING BIASED BY THE DATA.** I can't stress this point enough. The process of forming hypotheses should be independent of what data you have available. The correct method to this is after forming all possible hypotheses, you should be looking at the available data, and eliminating those hypotheses for which you don't have data.  
After the hypotheses are formed, you start looking at the data, and then the usual analytical solution follows - understand the data, do some EDA, test for hypotheses, do some ML (if the problem requires it), and yada yada yada. This is the part which most analysts are good at. For example - if the problem revolves around customer churn, this is the step where you'll go ahead with your classification modeling.Let me remind you, the output for this step is just an analytical solution - a classification model for your customer churn problem.   
Most of the time, the people for whom you're solving the problem would not be technically gifted, so they won't understand the Confusion Matrix output of a classification model or the output of an AUC ROC curve. They want you to talk in a language they understand. This is where we take the final road in our journey of problem-solving - the final step
3. **Convert the Analytical Solution to a Business Solution**  
An analytical solution is for computers, a business solution is for humans. And more or less, you'll be dealing with humans who want to understand what your many weeks' worth of effort has produced. You may have just created the most efficient and accurate ML model the world has ever seen, but if the final stakeholder is unable to interpret its meaning, then the whole exercise was useless.  
This is where you will use all your story-boarding experience to actually tell them a story that would start from the current state of their problem to the steps you have taken for them to reach the desired future state. This is where visualization skills, dashboard creation, insight generation, creation of decks come into the picture. Again, when you create dashboards or reports, keep in mind that you're telling a story, and not just laying down a beautiful colored chart on a Power BI or a Tableau dashboard. Each chart, each number on a report should be action-oriented, and part of a larger story.  
Only when someone understands your story, are they most likely going to purchase another book from you. Only when you make the journey beautiful and meaningful for your fellow passengers and stakeholders, will they travel with you again.

With that said, I've reached my destination. I hope you all do too. I'm totally open to criticism/suggestions/improvements that I can make to this journey.

q2wb8u,I work maximum 3-4 hours everyday and feel guilty all the time. What can I do to not feel like this?,"Hello!

My job role mainly involves building dashboards and sometimes data wrangling. I also am passively working on an ML project for my department. I am a good performer and have gotten nice performance review for my first year. My manager is also wants to promote me next year. This is my second year at my first job after Masters.

My work is not challenging so I get stuff done pretty quickly and manage to impress the management, therefore, I have a lot of free time which makes me feel guilty. Guilty about taking decent salary, wasting my time because I don't do self learning every day. I am however trying to find a new job now and have started interviewing but that doesn't help my feeling.

odlf3k,"What were some basic statistical concepts that when mastered, really took you far in solving problems?","I’ve heard of people taking ML courses and advanced courses like this, but what were some statistical concepts or even basic classes that you took, that may have seemed like something that was merely a prerequisite for another class, but was really something that helped you a lot in your work? And what basic statistical concepts/classes do you really recommend stats majors (like me) to really make sure we have a firm grasp of in order to do well in a job? Or what were some concepts that you got grilled in on interviews?








Edit: Thanks for all of your responses guys! As a stats major in college I’m really seeing how my first and second year probability and statistical inference courses come into
play in the real world problems you guys solve, and how the fundamentals like those mean so much more than just prerequisites for upper level courses. From what I’ve read, it seems like the most important topics i should be an expert on is:

Probability theory (probability distributions, how they are used to model real life phenomena, and their relations to each other)

Statistical Inference &amp; hypothesis testing (being able to quantify uncertainty and interpret results from tests, knowing about properties of estimators, p values and inference in the Bayesian context)

Regression analysis

uakf25,"Folks, am I crazy in thinking that a person that doesn't have a solid stat/math background should *not* be a data scientist?","So I was just zombie scrolling LinkedIn and a colleague reshared a post by a LinkedIn influencer (yeah yeah I know, why am I bothering...) and it went something like this:

> People use this image <insert mocking meme here> to explain doing machine learning (or data science) without statistics or math.

>Don't get discouraged by it. There's always people wanting to feel superior and the need to advertise it. You don't need to know math or statistics to do #datascience or #machinelearning. Does it help? Yes of course. Just like knowing C can help you understand programming languages but isn't a requirement to build applications with #Python

Now, the bit that concerned me was several hundred people commented along the lines of ""yes, thank you influencer I've been put down by maths/stats people before, you've encouraged me to continue my journey as a data scientist"".  

For the record, we can argue what is meant by a 'data science' job (as 90% of most consist mainly of requirements gathering and data wrangling) or where and how you apply machine learning. But I'm specifically referencing a job where a significant amount of time is spent building a detailed statistical/ML model. 
 
Like, my gut feeling is to shoutout ""this is wrong"" but it's got me wondering, is there any truth to this standpoint? I feel like ultimately it's a loaded question and it depends on the specifics for each of the tonnes of stat/ML modelling roles out there. Put more generally: On one hand, a lot of the actual maths is abstracted away by packages and a decent chunk of the application of inferential stats boils down to heuristic checks of test results. But I mean, on the other hand, how competently can you *analyse* those results if you decide that you're not going to invest in the maths/stats theory as part of your skillset? 

I feel like if I were to interview a candidate that wasn't comfortable with the mats/stats theory I wouldn't be confident in their abilities to build effective models within my team. *You're trying to build a career in mathematical/statistical modelling without having learnt or wanting to learn about the mathematical or statistical models themselves?* is a summary of how I'm feeling about this. 

What's your experience and opinion of people with limited math/stat skills in the field - do you think there is an air of ""snobbery"" and its importance is overstated or do you think that's just an outright dealbreaker?",465,225,TrollandDie,2022-04-24 02:08:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/uakf25/folks_am_i_crazy_in_thinking_that_a_person_that/,0,datascience
ss0vh9,I might have deleted a lot of stuff from a server and I'm absolutely terrified,"I work as a Machine Learning Engineer. I work out of a e2e server where most of the work stuff is stored an from where it's deployed to cloud.

Last night I was trying to work a bit and wanted to delete a bunch of subfolders (about 12) and wanted to use the command line to do it. I only recently started my job and I've never used command line before so I'm still learning.

I gave rm -rf -- /\* instead of rm -rf -- \*/ and it just started deleting everything. I manually interrupted the operation immediately after. But the server has shut down, and nobody is able to login. I think it needs a reboot from whoever has access.

This was Sunday night, which was last night. I told my manager on Slack but he hasn't responded yet.

Im absolutely terrified and I have no idea if any of it can be recovered. I've hardly been able to sleep before I wake up having a panic attack from a horrible dream.

m5mub0,Why do so many of us suck at basic programming?,"It's honestly unbelievable and frustrating how many Data Scientists suck at writing good code.

It's like many of us never learned basic modularity concepts, proper documentation writing skills, nor sometimes basic data structure and algorithms.

Especially when you're going into production how the hell do you expect to meet deadlines? Especially when some poor engineer has to refactor your entire spaghetti of a codebase written in some Jupyter Notebook?

If I'm ever at a position to hire Data Scientists, I'm definitely asking basic modularity questions.

Rant end.

Edit: I should say basic OOP and modular way of thinking. I've read too many codes with way too many interdependencies. Each function should do 1 particular thing colpletely not partly do 20 different things.

Edit 2: Okay so great many of you don't have production needs. But guess what, great many of us have production needs. When you're resource constrained and engineers can't figure out what to do with your code because it's a gigantic spaghetti mess, you're time to market gets delayed by months.

 
Who knows. Spending an hour a day cleaning up your code while doing your R&D could save months in the long-term. That's literally it. Great many of you are clearly super prejudiced and have very entrenched beliefs.

149ea3x,I don't want to be a Data Scientist Anymore,"Wanted to thank everyone for taking the time to read my thread. 

I'm almost 30 years old, and have been in the same career for 8 years. I'm a ""Data Scientist"" with a Bachelors degree in Mathematics & a Minor in CS. My day to day as a Data Scientist is a collection of building/testing/implementing SQL procedures, fitting simple models (Linear Models, Regression Trees, etc.), implementing model results as live models, delivering analysis to decision makers & executives. I work for a major financial institution. 

Here's the problem : I feel so disconnected & unpassionate about my job. It's partially an imposter syndrome issue. Looking at my skillset compared to other data scientists & those who are passionate about Data Science - I'm losing pace. My peers who care about this type of work are deeply involved in improved learning - new Python libraries, new modeling techniques. Everyone in this profession have a strong desire to learn & improve. This has really never been me. I was able to succeed in the mid to late 2010's being fresh out of school & having an ""up to date"" skillset ... but I don't think I have the drive or desire to do what I have to do to keep up in the mid to late 2020's.  

I feel like I fell into this career out of the start of my career, but now a few months away from 30 I'm questioning if this is what I want my next 25 years of work to be. I have friends, family and colleagues who are passionate & driven about work. I feel like this was the career I fell into because of my Math degree. I really don't know what it is I'm passionate about, but working as a data scientist in the financial sector for the next 25 years isn't it (or maybe being a data scientist at all). 

At the same time, I don't want to start my career fresh at the age of 30. I think I'm a naturally analytical person, and want to be able to carry over some of the skills I've picked up from the last 8 years into a new role, that might bring more passion & joy back into my job. 

So, I wanted to see if others on this sub have gone through the same thing. If yes - what were some stories you have that I can use as inspiration? Are there career options out there for ex Data Scientists who don't want to be technical code monkeys anymore, that can leverage some of our analytical backgrounds to thrive?

Thanks, look forward to hearing some stories",459,220,I_am_Howie_Dewitt,2023-06-14 17:50:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/149ea3x/i_dont_want_to_be_a_data_scientist_anymore/,0,datascience
i1z83r,"To all the data scientists with ADD, here are some tips to help!","This is anecdotal and has worked for me, I hope it works for you! 

1. Use arrows 
I tend to have so many hot fire ideas and solutions pouring out of my brain, Losing scope of a project. I remedied this by drawing arrows from IDEA to SOLUTION. Using my short attention span to my advantage, I could pour my mind out on paper and link those ideas to solutions, so whenever I need a structure, the arrows offer visual aid; removing the pesky anxious feelings. 

2. Writing diarrhea
Get everything out. When you’re flooded by thoughts, write down one word that associates with that thought. Keep going. You’ll run out of things to write down. If some of these things make sense to you, refer to 1. And draw some arrows! 

3. Tree diagrams and prune
When you’re overwhelmed by what you want to do first, using your word diarrhea and arrows, build from those components. Look at those connections, what makes it achievable to go from a to b? Extend the edges from component a to all it’s children, likewise for b, c and so on. 
COME BACK TO IT AT A LATER TIME!!! This is important. Come back to your mess of words with structured arrows and begin pruning. You may realize that neural net you wanted to program uses too much time! However maintain the links from left to right, from idea to product. 
Here’s an example: 

Idea: I want to predict house prices, product: send as analysis tool to sales team. 

From idea
        Program in python
        Program in c++ 

From product 
       Deliver as REST API 
       Deliver as an excel spreadsheet with formula 


Now you come back at a later time. You notice that you don’t want to program it in c++, and you want to deliver it as a function for excel. Prune that tree. 

4. Meditate at work
Take time off to spend 10 minutes outside or in another room practicing your breath. Keep it simple, think of your breath and let your natural thoughts come in. Try to go back to your breath. 

These worked wonders for me. I spend every morning drawing arrows! We have trello to keep track of our projects, but I’d still get lost anyway. The visual aid of an arrow works wonders for me, and I honestly can’t explain that, however, try it for yourself. 

Writing things down feels like I’m taking a massive shit after a heavy night of curry, once it’s out I feel so relieved. 

I hope this helps, and if you have any

1802ydm,Interviewing is terrible now. They don't treat you with any respect anymore,"I was laid off from my company earlier this year after 1.8 years of successful work experience at this company. I was recognized three times over that period, given merit increases in bonuses, shares of stock as rewards. Constantly praised and recognized several times, and never disciplined in any way or even told that my performance was an issue. I was laid off and they admitted that it was not for performance reasons, I was a great employee, they would love to see me work for them again...

So I start reapplying, I'm very dedicated to working for this company, and the interviews that I get are much more challenging than they were when I started with the company. Previously, they asked me about my background, skills, experience, and had me interview with other people on the team. This time around, I had to do case studies that were extremely challenging. One of them I had 3 hours to go through an absurdly complex Excel assignment that involved three separate spreadsheets of data and building a data lookup tool using Excel. Like, creating a tableau report, just using data validation and dropdowns and stuff and conditional formatting I guess? Sounds stupid and I've never done something so crazy so yep I failed hard. Also had another interview based around SQL, which I know like the back of my hand. Aced the interview, and almost got an offer, but disqualified last round.

Then I had another interview for BI engineer position, and they were “disappointed” with me for not speaking to what SQL I’d used. The manager was honestly a douche, I could tell just from his demeanor, and how he acted. Dude seemed like he was barely invested in the interview. It was supposed to be a meet and greet, NOT an interview, that’s verbatim what I was told. Then I get told I should’ve explained size of my SQL queries, how many rows, types of joins. Like uh, it’s a meet and greet to learn more about the role, and YOU did not ask ME any of that either?

It’s just so infuriating.... 3 years ago, we had 1-3 interviews for low to mid level jobs. Now its 3-8 interviews minimum plus 2+ case studies, for ANY JOB.

But in the most of cases the stakeholders only need some simple bar charts and line plots, some comparatives, some quantiles. And modelling a random forest or logistic regression do a preety good job in general  for tabular data when there is predictive variables.

Don't get me wrong, I love those complicated models, and tried to apply in real life, sometimes with sucess and sometimes not, but in majority of cases is overkill.

I'm one of the developers that have been working on a package that enables faster hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models. We recognized that sklearn's GridSearchCV is too slow, especially for today's larger models and datasets, so we're introducing [tune-sklearn](https://github.com/ray-project/tune-sklearn). Just 1 line of code to superpower Grid/Random Search with

* Bayesian Optimization
* Early Stopping
* Distributed Execution using Ray Tune
* GPU support

Check out our blog post here and let us know what you think!

[https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/gridsearchcv-2-0-new-and-improved-ee56644cbabf](https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/gridsearchcv-2-0-new-and-improved-ee56644cbabf)

&#x200B;

Installing [tune-sklearn](https://github.com/ray-project/tune-sklearn):

`pip install tune-sklearn scikit-optimize ray[tune]` or `pip install tune-sklearn scikit-optimize ""ray[tune]""` depending on your os.

Quick Example:

    from tune_sklearn import TuneSearchCV
    
    # Other imports
    import scipy
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier
    
    # Set training and validation sets
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=11000, n_features=1000, n_informative=50, 
                               n_redundant=0, n_classes=10, class_sep=2.5)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=1000)
    
    # Example parameter distributions to tune from SGDClassifier
    # Note the use of tuples instead if Bayesian optimization is desired
    param_dists = {
       'alpha': (1e-4, 1e-1),
       'epsilon': (1e-2, 1e-1)
    }
    
    tune_search = TuneSearchCV(SGDClassifier(),
       param_distributions=param_dists,
       n_iter=2,
       early_stopping=True,
       max_iters=10,
       search_optimization=""bayesian""
    )
    
    tune_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
    print(tune_search.best_params_)

## CHARACTERISTICS OF IMPOSTER SYNDROME

Some of the common signs of imposter syndrome include ([reference](https://so06.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/IJBS/article/view/521/pdf)):

* Self-doubt
* An inability to realistically assess your competence and skills
* Attributing your success to external factors
* Berating your performance
* Fear that you won’t live up to expectations
* Overachieving
* Sabotaging your own success
* Setting incredibly challenging goals and feeling disappointed when you fall short

## WHAT IS IMPOSTER SYNDROME?

[YouTube Video - The Imposter Syndrome](https://youtu.be/eqhUHyVpAwE)

Imposter syndrome is loosely defined as doubting your abilities and feeling like a fraud. It disproportionately affects high-achieving people, who find it difficult to accept their accomplishments. Many Data Scientists question whether they are deserving of accolades, their job, recognition, or the like.

* You do not have enough time to learn something you want to learn.
* You look around and see that there are other people that know that thing you don’t have time to learn.
* You feel incompetent.

Why do so many Data Scientists have it?

Data Science is an extremely broad field of study. There are core competencies required to have a successful career in data science, but there is also a lot of industry specific and technical knowledge that is ever changing.  
Data Science is a career which has many job options, all of which require a high level of expertise and knowledge. If the broad, seemingly confused data science job postings show us anything, it is that many companies do not really understand what a data scientist is, how they compare to a data engineer or software engineer, and how to train or support them within an organization. To add to this, the labor market for data scientists in predominantly new graduated or early career professionals.

When challenge is high, and expectations are unknown it encourages people to fall into high arousal, anxiety, and worry. You can see this from psychologist’s [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) flow model.

These feelings are compounded by a lack of support, feedback, and mentorship provided within a company. This is not generally intentional but a product of small data science departments, business executives licking their wounds from years of poor data quality and technical deficit and increasing demand for better data driven outcomes.

## HOW CAN DATA SCIENTISTS DEAL WITH IMPOSTER SYNDROME?

[According to the American Psychology Association](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2013/11/fraud), If you recognize yourself in the description of the impostor phenomenon, take heart. There are ways to overcome the belief that you don’t measure up.

In a nutshell, there are three ideas that you need to get in your head in order to get over imposter syndrome:

* You are a generally competent person.
* There are always going to be people that know more about a certain area of data science than you and that’s ok and expected. Even more importantly: you’re not the smartest person in the planet, so if you look hard enough, you’re going to find people that are better than you at everything you do and that’s ok.
* You have a finite amount of time to learn things, and your goal shouldn’t be to learn the most, but to learn the things that maximize your specific goals – generally, this is going to be career advancement, but for some it may be something else.

When the Imposter Syndrome feeling comes up:

1. Remind yourself that you are a competent person – if you weren’t, you wouldn’t have gotten to the position you are in right now, whether that’s graduating from college or leading a data science team (yes, even DS team leaders catch the ‘drome from time to time).
2. Remind yourself that when you look for people who know more than you about a specific area, you are guaranteed to find them – that’s just how it works. People choose to specialize in certain areas, and if you only focus on that area of expertise, you are going to feel inadequate. But even more importantly, recognize that if you run into someone who is better than you at literally everything you do, that doesn’t diminish your value – it just means you have run into someone that is pretty special\*
3. Get back to prioritizing what to learn. Do you *need* to learn that or do you just *want* to learn it to feel better about yourself? If the latter, learn to let it go, and focus on the things you need to learn – and save the things you want to learn for when you have the time, which will come.

### TALK TO YOUR MENTORS.

“The thing that made so much of a difference was supportive, encouraging supervision”.

Many have benefited from sharing their feelings with a mentor who helped them recognize that their impostor feelings are both normal and irrational. Though many will often struggle with these feelings, you must be able to recognize personal or professional progress and growth instead of comparing myself to other students and professionals.

### RECOGNIZE YOUR EXPERTISE.

Don’t just look to those who are more experienced, more popular, or more successful for help. Tutoring or working with younger students, for instance, can help you realize how far you’ve come and how much knowledge you have to impart. This can be a great way for a Data Scientist to give back to the industry as well as set a more realistic benchmark of your perceived value.

### REMEMBER WHAT YOU DO WELL.

Psychologists Suzanne Imes, PhD, and Pauline Rose Clance, PhD, in the 1970s, impostor phenomenon occurs among high achievers who are unable to internalize and accept their success.

Imes encourages her clients to make a realistic assessment of their abilities. “Most high achievers are pretty smart people, and many really smart people wish they were geniuses. But most of us aren’t,” she says. “We have areas where we’re quite smart and areas where we’re not so smart.” She suggests writing down the things you’re truly good at, and the areas that might need work. That can help you recognize where you’re doing well, and where there’s legitimate room for improvement.

## REALIZE NO ONE IS PERFECT.

Clance urges people with impostor feelings to stop focusing on perfection. “Do a task ‘well enough,'” she says. It’s also important to take time to appreciate the fruits of your hard work. “Develop and implement rewards for success — learn to celebrate,” she adds.

### CHANGE YOUR THINKING.

>“let the challenge excite you rather than overwhelm you.”

People with impostor feelings must reframe the way they think about their achievements, says Imes. She helps her clients gradually chip away at the superstitious thinking that fuels the impostor cycle. That has best done incrementally, she says. For instance, rather than spending 10 hours on an assignment, you might cut yourself off at eight. Or you may let a friend read a draft that you haven’t yet perfectly polished. “Superstitions need to be changed very gradually because they are so strong,” she says.

Avoid all or nothing thinking. Just like a standard distribution, most Data Scientists fall within the center. If you find yourself comparing to outliers, then you are going to continue to feel like a fraud, which will in return stifle your career in data science.  


[YouTube - How you can use imposter syndrome to your benefit - Mike Cannon-Brookes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkwqZfvbdFw&ab_channel=TED)

### TALK TO SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP.

For many people with impostor feelings, individual therapy can be extremely helpful. A psychologist or other therapist can give you tools to help you break the cycle of impostor thinking.

The impostor phenomenon is still an experience that tends to fly under the radar. Often the people affected by impostor feelings don’t realize they could be living some other way. They don’t have any idea it’s possible not to feel so anxious and fearful all the time.",455,43,RexRecruiting,2021-05-12 17:29:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/nauc4w/in_the_spirit_of_mental_health_month_imposter/,0,datascience

swh10r,Failed an interview because of this stat question.,"# Update/TLDR:

This post garnered a lot more support and informative responses than I anticipated - thank you to everyone who contributed.

I thought it would be beneficial to others to summarize the key takeaways.

I compiled top-level notions for your perusal, however, I would still suggest going through the comments as there are a lot of very informative and thought-provoking discussions on these topics.

&#x200B;

**Interview Question:**

>"" What if you run another test for another problem, alpha = .05 and you get a p-value = .04999 and subsequently you run it once more and get a p-value of .05001?""

The question was surrounded around the idea of accepting/rejecting the null hypothesis.  I believe the interviewer was looking for - How I would interpret the results. Why the p-value changed.  Not much additional information or context was given. 

**Suggested Answers:**

* u/bolivlake \- [The Difference Between “Significant” and “Not Significant” is not Itself Statistically Significant](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/signif4.pdf)

&#x200B;

* u/LilyTheBet \- Implementing a Bayesian A/B test might yield more transparent results and more practical in business decision making ([https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html](https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html))

&#x200B;

* u/glauskies \- Practical significance vs statistical significance. A lot of companies look for practical significance. There are cases where you can reject the null but the alternate hypothesis does not lead to any real-world impact.

&#x200B;

* u/dmlane \- I think the key thing the interviewer wanted to see is that you wouldn’t draw different conclusions from the two experiments.

&#x200B;

* u/Cheaptat \- Possible follow-up questions: how expensive would the change this test is designed to measure be? Was the average impact positive for the business, even if questionably measurable? What would the potential drawback of implementing it be? They may well have wanted you to state some assumptions (reasonable ones, perhaps a few key archetypes) and explain what you’d have done.

&#x200B;

* u/seesplease \- Assuming the null hypothesis is true, you have a 1/20 chance of getting a p-value below 0.05. If you test the same hypothesis twice and a p-value around 0.05 both times with an effect size in the same direction, you just witnessed a \~1/400 event assuming the null is true! Therefore, you should reject the null.

&#x200B;

* u/robml  u/-lawnder  \-Bonferroni's Correction. Common practice to avoid data snooping is that you divide the alpha threshold by the number of tests you conduct. So say I conduct 5 tests with an alpha of 0.05, I would test for an individual alpha of 0.01 to try and curtail any random significance.You divide alpha by the number of tests you do. That's your new alpha.

&#x200B;

* u/Coco_Dirichlet \- Note - If you calculate marginal effects/first differences, for some values of X there could be a significant effect on Y.

&#x200B;

* u/spyke252 \- I think they were specifically trying to test knowledge of what p-hacking is in order to avoid it!

&#x200B;

* u/dcfan105 \- an attempt to test if you'd recognize the problem with making a decision based on whether a single probability is below some arbitrary alpha value. Even if we assume that everything else in the study was solid - large sample size, potential confounding variables controlled for, etc., a p value *that* close the alpha value is clearly not very strong evidence, *especially* if a subsequent p value was just slightly above alpha.

&#x200B;

* u/quantpsychguy \- if you ran the test once and got 0.049 and then again and got 0.051, I'm seeing that the data is changing. It might represent drift of the variables (or may just be due to incomplete data you're testing on).

&#x200B;

* u/oldmangandalfstyle \- understanding to be that p-values are useless outside the context of the coefficient/difference. P-values asymptotically approach zero, so in large samples they are worthless. And also the difference between 0.049 and 0.051 is literally nothing meaningful to me outside the context of the effect size. It’s critical to understand that a p-value is strictly a conditional probability that the null is true given the observed relationship. So if it’s just a probability, and not a hard stop heuristic, how does that change your perspective of its utility?

&#x200B;

* u/24BitEraMan \- It might also be that you are attributing a perfectly fine answer to them deciding not to hire you, when they already knew who they wanted to hire and were simply looking for anything to tell you no.

&#x200B;

\-----

&#x200B;

**Original Post:**

Long story short, after weeks of interviewing, made it to the final rounds, and got rejected because of this very basic question:

Interviewer: Given you run an A/B test and the alpha is .05 and you get a p-value = .01 what do you do (in regards to accepting/rejecting h0 )?

Me: I would reject the null hypothesis.

Interviewer: Ok... what if you run another test for another problem, alpha = .05 and you get a p-value = .04999 and subsequently you run it once more and get a p-value of .05001 ?

Me: If the first test resulted in a p-value of .04999 and the alpha is .05 I would again reject the null hypothesis. I'm not sure I would keep running tests unless I was not confident with the power analysis and or how the tests were being conducted.

Interviewer: What else could it be?

Me: I would really need to understand what went into the test, what is the goal, are we picking the proper variables to test, are we addressing possible confounders? Did we choose the appropriate risk (alpha/beta) , is our sample size large enough, did we sample correctly (simple,random,independent), was our test run long enough?

Anyways he was not satisfied with my answer and wasn't giving me any follow-up questions to maybe steer me into the answer he was looking for and basically ended it there.

I will add I don't have a background in stats so go easy on me, I thought my answers were more or less on the right track and for some reason he was really trying to throw red herrings at me and play ""gotchas"".

Would love to know if I completely missed something obvious, and it was completely valid to reject me. :) Trying to do better next time.

I appreciate all your help.",456,160,unixmint,2022-02-19 18:52:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/swh10r/failed_an_interview_because_of_this_stat_question/,0,datascience

ln2jnt,Floods of junior applicants are forcing companies to erase Data Scientist positions for Senior ones,"I've been noticing this very insane trend lately of tech companies opening up Data Scientist positions, only to immediately delete them and put up the same exact position, but under a new Senior title with 4 or 5+ years of experience requested.

This is something I did not expect, but I confirmed it with my recruiter friend the other day. She told me that within few days days, they received 400+ applications, mostly juniors without data experience. Since they couldn't go through all of them just to get to those with actual data experience, the company decided to instead reintroduce the same job but radically push up the YOE expected so that they can get to actual viable candidates. In others words, a slow death of 2+ YOE data positions that were once a staple in the industry.

This is crazy to me and I don't know what to think. Normally, with my \~3 YOE I would've qualified for the original data scientist position. But now that these roles have been converted to Senior with 5+ years, I've become suddenly incapable of applying to these positions (auto filters from ATS systems for example). I'm starting to play the blame game, which isn't really healthy behavior, but I don't know where to take out the rage.

I understand that YOE is just a number, but the bigger issue is that there seems to be enough super seniors in the market for companies to feel confident about redirecting their efforts to targeting these super seniors instead of more mid level people (forget college grads or those without any data experience atm), and not feel worried about the potential cost of their actions. This is the most shocking part, that people with 4, 5+ YOE haven't been absorbed into the job market yet in this economy, and these are the people I'm competing against.

**Edit:** all the Data Science jobs I've bookmarked few days ago are ""no longer accepting applications"". This is ridiculous, I bookmark them on the same day the positions came out. Does that mean a) they either stop after two days and receiving 500+ apps or b) are they deleting these positions to reopen new ones with senior titles as I mentioned?

jmwrcr,"Seriously, how am I expected to grow in a profession where everyone discourages me from building anything non-trivial","**TL;DR:** switched from software engineering to data science 3 years ago looking for a more challenging career. Have had zero technical growth since then. Looking for a way out.

Myself: in my late 20s, started my career as a software engineer (2 YOE), then did a Masters in DS and since then have spent another 3 years as a data scientist (had one job in a mid-size startup and another one in a late-stage startup).

As a SWE, I wanted to switch to data science to have a more intellectually stimulating and rewarding job. Somehow I had this idea that DS would make it possible for me to pair my SWE skills with passion for maths, and I was really looking forward to lots of technical growth and exciting projects. Thinking now that this may have been my biggest career mistake so far as it's been the exact opposite.

Every single senior colleague I've been working with has been explicitly discouraging me from building anything more complex than a logistic regression, and usually suggested that I should implement some simple SQL / if-else solution instead. In fact, 90% of my job has always been data lackey work answering silly ad-hoc questions from stakeholders using SQL or basic pandas. I feel like I haven't learned anything in the last 3 years except for tons of non-transferrable domain knowledge that I deeply don't care about.

I totally get it that as a data scientist, I am expected to provide business value - and not build fancy models. It is just that I no longer see how I can pair being useful with having at least some benefits for my career and technical growth.

I once had this guy on my team who was complaining a lot about DS applicants he was interviewing back then. His problem was with them mentioning ""passion for neural networks"" on their CVs and not being ""down to earth"" enough. The guy then went on to change teams, work as a front-end developer and learn all the fancy React stuff, and then switched teams again to do backend engineering, learn yet another language and use his new skills to tackle some really cool problems.

Like wow, it almost feels as if people in this industry sincerely believe it is okay for a software engineer to keep learning and have lots of technical growth, whereas a data scientist is expected to know their place and be stuck doing SQL / occasionally treat themselves to some very basic ML.

I guess there are some DS positions out there that are not like that but they seem to be incredibly rare, and it feels like every year of this sort of ""experience"" makes it less and less likely for me to ever get into real ML as the market feels so competitive.

I am thinking that I should go back to software engineering while it's not too late. Have some of you guys been in a similar position? What do you think?",450,141,ds9329,2020-11-02 21:33:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/jmwrcr/seriously_how_am_i_expected_to_grow_in_a/,0,datascience

gtv2c9,I got the chance to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team!,"Hey guys -

Had the opportunity to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team. Thought I'd share some of it here, in case you find it helpful :)

**What do you do & where do you work?**

My name is Divyansh Agarwal and I am a data scientist at Uber in San Francisco. I’m working on  the Shared Rides business, and work on building products that grow the business. Some of my work also involves optimizing the efficiency of Uber’s ride sharing marketplace by improving graph optimization algorithms for rider-driver matching, and evaluating their performance via experimentation and simulations.

**When did you first become interested in Data Science?**

So, I had an interest in machine learning and predictive analytics before going into university. I wrote about it in my college essays as well.

But I was also interested in software engineering and fields like security. What really made me truly interested in data science was taking [Data 8](http://data8.org/) at UC Berkeley. I really liked the fact that you could use statistics to extract insights from data and provide value - and although I had always been aware of this, I only realized then how powerful statistics could be and how computing facilitates all of this.

After that, I started doing a bunch of projects, some internships, and got involved in research.

**When applying for jobs, was it hard to choose between going for a software engineering role as opposed to a data science role?**

Not really - I was always set on data science once I got into it. I used software engineering more as a backup, because given my CS background it would have been easy to get a software job if I just prepped hard for their interviews.

It’s actually harder to get a data science job out of undergrad. This is because there’s a general bias towards people with graduate degrees and people with a lot of experience. So you need to have either of both - either you need to have a lot of work experience, or you need to have a PHD.

So that’s why I built experience through doing projects, research, internships, etc.

For Data Science, there’s no real standardized process when it comes to interviewing - it varies a lot from company to company (this is in contrast to software engineering where using websites like LeetCode can get you ready for almost all jobs).

So I had to spend a lot of time prepping for each specific company I interviewed with - at every stage of the process - and this ended up taking a lot of time.

**When applying to Uber, did you have projects in mind you wanted to work on? How much did you know about the company?**

After my sophomore year of college, I was invited for this intern open house at Uber. That’s when I met some of the team across rides, security, and eats. I spoke to this guy on the marketplace team and another guy on the maps team, I was really interested in those teams.

What’s really cool about the marketplace team specifically is that it’s at the intersection of computer science, economics, optimization, statistics, and there’s a lot of hard & interesting problems that can be solved from an algorithmic perspective.

So after this event I attended, I knew that I wanted to be on the marketplace team at Uber. So during my senior year recruiting, I reached out to someone on the marketplace team, and they were interested in me, so that’s how I started interviewing at Uber.

**What is your team responsible for and why is this work critical to Uber’s business?**

I’m on the Shared Rides team (which is a part of Marketplace Dynamics). The core of building new shared rides products and features come from [matching improvements](https://marketplace.uber.com/matching) or UI and experience improvements. So either tweaking these algorithms, designing & analyzing experiments, understanding how users are responding to new product features - these are all very important and central to Uber’s business.

What are some challenges (both technical and non-technical) your team faces?

The biggest challenge for our team (and I think this is true for any consumer internet product) is building something that people actually like that meets your business objectives. Because everytime you change something with the product, one metric might become worse and the other might become better.

It’s also really hard to figure out what users really want and what they really like. This involves a lot of UX research, as well as experimentation. This stuff is really challenging. Here’s another example:

So, there’s an optimization & efficiency side of Shared Rides - there’s always a tension between the two. If I make something more optimal, it might hurt the experience. If I make the experience better, we have to give some leeway on the optimization side of things. So that’s this underlying technical tension that’s always there.

On the product side, as I had already mentioned, it just comes down to building something users really want. So we have designers and UX researchers who are embedded within shared rides, as well as marketing folks, and I have to work cross functionally with these guys to problem solve on a daily basis.

**You interned at Quora before Uber - can you tell me differences between both companies and how that affected your work?**

So Quora was a very small company - there were only 230 people or so when I was working there (two years ago). There were fewer layers of management, it was easier to know people across the company - for example I even got the chance to speak with the CEO on a couple of occasions. There was also less bureaucracy I guess.

At Uber, since it’s a bigger company, sometimes if you want to build something you might need to get buy-in from another team, there’s more bureaucracy, there’s more layers between you and executive management.

Like at Quora, I knew the Head of Data Science very well, but at Uber I can’t imagine doing that currently (given I’ve just begun my career).

At a bigger company like Uber though, you’re working on projects that have bigger scope, bigger impact on the world, and you work with a lot more people. I’m also more specialized within my role here at Uber - at Quora I could have had more flexibility in terms of what I wanted to work on. At Uber, I’m on a very specific team, in a very specific role, working on a very specific part of the product. This has significant advantages: We’re working on specialized problems that are really challenging, and I’m surrounded by people who have been thinking deeply about these problems for a while are are super passionate about these problems. There’s some incredible learning to be had there.

Finally, in a smaller company it’s also a lot easier to hang out with your teammates - Quora for instance had organized clubs (poker, badminton etc) across the board that made it really easy to meet people in different teams. At Uber, that’s much harder to do, but you meet an equivalent amount of people within your own team, since teams are much larger at Uber.

**What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Data Scientist (either a career changer or a college student)?**

Data science roles are defined very differently based on the team, company, size, role you’re working on. For instance, even Uber Data Science can vary greatly across teams - for example, I work on the Shared Rides / Matching team, which is mostly Operations Research, which is a field about optimization. And I didn’t even study Operations Research in college. The important thing to understand is that different teams have different scopes. For instance, the pricing team does a lot of machine learning. Some other teams are trying to understand user experience. So having a strong base is really important, because at companies like Uber, there’s many directions you could go in.

In the Data Science industry overall, there’s broadly three tracks:

1. Algorithms (building models, doing ML)
2. Inference (understanding causality)
3. Analytics (building dashboards, writing SQL, reporting metrics, analyzing simple A/Bs)

Most of the Data Science jobs involve Analytics or Inference.

At Quora, they were mostly on the inference side of things. They were trying to understand product opportunities, trends in user behavior, and see if new product features were impactful.

On Uber, on my team at least, I’m more focused on building algorithms.

So in terms of advice: you need to focus on what you’re actually interested in (within the domains listed above). Of course, there’s going to be work that’s a mix of both, but knowing which topics interest you will help you map out and identify which companies you want to work for.

Everything is going to be very team and company specific, so don’t look at titles, but actually look at what the role is, talk to people on the team, and do your research.

Stats theory is also important, but on the job you’re not really going to be actively using theory too much. What really matters is understanding and gaining intuition. For example, I didn’t study a lot of Operations Research in college, but I took a bunch of Machine Learning and Algorithms classes in college which helped me build intuition for how Operations Research works, since the field is about optimization - which is what Machine Learning and Algorithms are about.

The purpose of theory is to build intuition and understand things.

14ivufl,Why is there no interest in Business Analytics?,"My job title is Analytics Manager and I work for a large company that has a formal Business Intelligence/Data Science department. In this org, we are split into 3 parts: 1) Data Engineering, 2) Data Science, and 3) Business Analytics

Data Engineering builds the data pipelines, ETLs, and manages the data warehouse. Data Science works on very specific projects like recommender, search, and customer churn models.

Meanwhile Business Analytics is like the business jobs that are also technical. Their job can be dashboarding, executive reporting, strategy insights, market analytics, etc. but they have to know a lot of SQL and some programming in order to extract the data and transform it into insights. They also need to know business context. It’s like 50% coding and 50% making financial models and/or PowerPoint decks for execs.

When we interview people, especially interns and younger candidates, nobody wants to do BA. Everyone wants to do DS. The ironic thing is the DS jobs are the fewest in quantity and they only hire the most qualified people (usually people with PhDs). All the DE people have backgrounds in CS and the BA people have backgrounds like people on this sub where they usually have a MS in DS or Analytics.

It just seems like the BA jobs are off putting to many candidates. As soon as I mention PowerPoint or excel, I can feel their souls die lol. The truth is it’s part of the job, but there’s more to it than that. I code a lot, I grab data from APIs, I go through developer docs, but yes, I also build decks and am good at it. I think there’s more jobs in this sector and more upside for promotions and job opportunities.

It just seems like such an agonizing amount of busy work: sizing and resizing text boxes and images, dealing with templates, hunting down icons for flowcharts, trying to make everything line up the way it should even though it never really does--all to see my beautiful dynamic dashboards reduced to static cutouts. Bullet points in general seem like a lot of unnecessary violence.

123tx9p,Has ChatGPT killed doomers?,"Sorry for another ChatGPT post but I think it really is the end of asking whether certain job sectors will exist on r/DataScience due to ChatGPT making them redundant.

Whilst reading all of the 100's of doomer posts 'Will Data Science survive because ChatGPT' - it dawned on me that Chat GPT can replace all of the users creating these posts. They've all been made redundant. A simple prompt to an AI like 'Write a profoundly dumb Reddit post asking if Chat GPT has made Data Science redundant' - will return exactly that. With a simple workflow/pipeline the response from the API can be posted directly to r/DataScience.

puh45x,Advice to all job seekers: be as critical to the company as they are to you,"Been seeing a lot of posts recently of people being hired to do data science and ending up in, from a data point of view, suboptimal work places. In my opinion many of these places had red flags from to get go based on the description of the company they gave. 

My main advice is to be as critical to the company as they are to you:

Screen their job posting with as much rigour as they screen your CV trying to get a sense of what you'll *really* be doing irrespective of your 'data scientist' job title. Typical red flags for me would be (not exhaustive):

* No mention of cloud related tooling.
* SQL and data warehousing featuring more promintently than anything else. Reason being that if I wanted to do a DA job, which I really enjoyed from past experiences, I would just apply for that.
* No mention of any kind of version control.
* ""Use whatever tools and languages you want on the job"". This one is very particular but to me that would indicate no standardisation, probably a lot of csv files, excel users, ad-hoc analysis on notebooks and very little being put into production / automated. This might be a pet peeve but I believe in many cases long term value from data can't *just* be done through ad-hoc analyses and 99 % of companies aren't mature enough to let everyone use their own tools without it becoming an unmaintanable mess.
* No mention of anything casual. This one is personal, colleagues are colleagues and not necessarily friends but a workplace with a few social amenities would make being 8-9 hours in the office more bearable.

Not all of the information you value can be gotten from the job posting so the next step would be to think about what you value ahead of the interview and ask them in a polite manner. Job interviews should be as much of you deciding if they are a fit for you as vice versa.

This may help you to uncover small details that can help you decide picking one offer over the other. Even if you only have 1 offer knowing what you're getting into in advance can help you make peace with / prepare for it.",431,54,None,2021-09-24 10:41:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/puh45x/advice_to_all_job_seekers_be_as_critical_to_the/,0,datascience

13peb5z,Job is a nightmare - Advice,"Hi. I'm 24F. Recently finished my masters in statistics. Interested in data science and miraculously I was hired to do analysis for two large companies under the same parent group. I was super excited but 3 months later. I'm miserable. 

I thought I would've been able to take some data and clean it up and do some cool analysis on it. But it's so much. I can't handle this. I have to keep track of customer and sales data for two large companies. Most of the data isn't even clean. There's about 5 platforms to keep track of for each. There's stupid meetings every day. Presentations for each company every week. And then in-between that I have to find time to do my own work. I have no personal time. My relationship died.

My boss is an absolute nightmare. A stereotypical corporate bro. The most emotionless uncaring blunt workaholic person I've ever met. I can do nothing right in his eyes. I've never received a list of specific tasks to do. Sometimes I give him insights into some data and he ignores it. I don't care for a bunch of emotional shit but a little bit of empathy or something. And then they're telling me about their plans for me long term in the company and they've already sent me on a trip abroad for training.

I just wanted to use some sales/customer data and do some analysis man. This is too much. How do I even navigate this?

Edit:  HI. I got some good advice in here and some bad. Thank you for all.

1. I don't live in the states. I live in a third world country where jobs are very hard to come by, especially one in your field, so I'm very lucky rn. 
2. I have the owner of a local consultancy firm trying to get me to work with him as a side hustle. It's an option if I want.

t1cn0l,My thoughts(rant) on data science consulting,"This is gonna be mostly a rant but may make someone think twice if they are thinking of joining a consulting firm as a data scientist.

So, last year I completed my masters and joined one of the big 4 firms as a data scientist. As excited as I was in the beginning, 6 months down the line I’ve started to hate my job.

I always thought working a data science job would make my knowledge base grow, but it seems like in consulting no one gives a damn about your knowledge because no one cares if you’re right, they just want to please the client. Isn’t the point of analysing and modelling data to learn from it, to draw insights? At consulting firms everything is so client oriented that all you end up doing is serving to the client’s bias. It doesn’t matter if you modelled the data right, if the client “thinks” the estimate should be x, it should come out to be x. Then why the hell do you want me to build you a model? 

The job is all about making good looking ppts and achieving estimates the client wants you to and closing the project. There isn’t any belief in the process of data science, no respect for the maths behind it

Edit; People who are commenting, I would love some help regarding my career. What should I do next? What industries are popular for having in-house data scientists who do meaningful jobs? Also, for some context, I’ve a masters in economics.

Edit 2; people who are asking how I didn’t know and saying how it is so obvious, guys, I simply didn’t know. I don’t come from a family of corporate workers. My line of thinking was that no one can be as big without doing something valuable.

n959rr,Is data science too broad to ever feel prepared for an interview?,"I'm a ""data scientist"" that does data engineering.  I get data science interviews from my job title alone.  Does anyone else think data science is too broad of a field to ever feel prepared for the interview.  For example, I feel data science jobs can be broken down into the following types of roles:





1) The typical data scientist: This is what we typically how we imagine a data scientist.  The role involves a bit of data exploration, ML model building, presentations to management, etc.




2) The deep learning data scientist: This is kind of like the previous example, but with a greater emphasis on deep learning over traditional ML.  The role is more likely to ask for a PhD.  This role looks at more interesting problems in my opinion, such as computer vision and NLP.





3) The data engineering data scientist: This is like my current role.  I work on ETL pipelines and bring new data to data scientists in the previous categories for ML model building.  Because of my job title, I might be asked to do some data analysis work.  I work a lot with python, SQL, and AWS.





4) Software Engineer (Data Science): This data scientist is in reality a software engineer attached to a data science team.  This is not as common, but definitely exists.



5) The data analyst with a data scientist job title: With this type of data scientist, there is less python and ML, and more SQL, Excel, and presentations.  Hiring managers typically look at non-technical skills over technical skills.






Those are all the roles I can think of, and I am sure I am missing some.  But assuming you fit one of the categories, it's pretty hard to prepare for all other data science interviews.  Some roles only leetcode you, others might ask SQL questions, others might ask math/stats trivia, others might give you a take home presentation to prepare.",431,64,memcpy94,2021-05-10 14:07:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/n959rr/is_data_science_too_broad_to_ever_feel_prepared/,0,datascience
lflos5,Competitive Job Market,"Hey all,

At my current job as an ML engineer at a tiny startup (4 people when I joined, now 9), we're currently hiring for a data science role and I thought it might be worth sharing what I'm seeing as we go through the resumes.

We left the job posting up for 1 day, for a Data Science position. We're located in Waterloo, Ontario. For this nobody company, in 24 hours we received 88 applications.

Within these application there are more people with Master's degrees than either a flat Bachelor's or PhD. I'm only half way through reviewing, but those that are moving to the next round are in the realm of matching niche experience we might find useful, or are highly qualified (PhD's with X-years of experience).

This has been eye opening to just how flooded the market is right now, and I feel it is just shocking to see what the response rate for this role is. Our full-stack postings in the past have not received nearly the same attention.

kfaqxq,I've been on over ~20 coffee chats the last 5 months - here's everything I've learnt so far :),"I’ve had the chance to meet tons of awesome tech professionals over the last 6 months.

I’ve been curious to find out more about their backgrounds and listen to them describe what it is that they do on a day to day basis.

The number one benefit of doing this has been that I’ve been exposed to a variety of new industries, roles, and opportunities.

I’ve learnt about *why* people have made certain career transitions, how they’ve successfully learnt new skills, and what advice they have for others hoping to do the same.

All I’ve been basically doing is going on coffee chats (over Zoom, of course). And sharing them with everyone on the internet.

Here's what I've learnt so far & I hope you can also leverage coffee chats to advance your data science career.

**What is a Coffee Chat?**

A coffee chat is an informational interview where you find out more about a person’s professional experience and goals.

If there’s only one thing you get from this article, it should be the following: a coffee chat is not a place for you to ask for a job. It may certainly help you land a role in the future (and I’ll talk about this later), but if you’re going into a coffee chat with the sole intent of asking for a job, you’re doing it wrong.

Instead, a good coffee chat’s primary purpose should be to build trust and for both individuals to get to know each other.

**Why You Should Do Coffee Chats**

An obvious reason to go on more coffee chats is to increase your future chances of getting the role you want.

So assuming you want to work at Twitter on their Data Science team, you could go reach out to a data scientist there and speak with them for 30min. Assuming the conversation goes well, you can continue to follow up and stay in touch for a few months.

Then, say a year later, when you apply for a new data scientist role at Twitter, you can get referred, and sometimes you can even skip the whole line and directly meet with the hiring manager.

Another reason to go on a coffee chat is to find out about what a particular job role or industry consists of and to get information on how to break in. Here, you again reach out to someone who’s knowledgeable in a field and then ask them questions regarding what it is that they do.

So for example, let’s say I want to make a career transition into data science. I browse the data science subreddit and read a bunch of how-to posts and come across someone who’s written about their experience transitioning from biology to data science.

I decide that this person can give me useful tips so I send them an email and end up going on a coffee chat with them. This way, I can get direct advice from someone who’s done what I want to do.

If you’re reaching out to someone to ask for a job, you’re not asking for a coffee chat - you’re just asking for an interview. And that’s very different.

**How To Reach Out**

I recommend reaching out via email over Linkedin or Twitter. Everybody checks their email, even if they might not reply to you.

When sending an email to someone you want to go on a coffee chat with, keep it short and be specific. There’s probably a particular reason why you decided to reach out to someone - be sure to mention it in your email.

Here's an example:

***Email*** ***Example:***

In my senior year of college, I wanted to get a job in tech. As an international student, I had to get sponsorship and this was quite a big issue - I wanted to chat with someone who had been through this process before.

I came across Jay's Linkedin profile and realized that he was an international student who also had a similar economics related background to me ([link to image](https://www.careerfair.io/assets_coffee_chat/Jay_Linkedin_Profile_1.png)) and had also gotten a job in tech ([link to image](https://www.careerfair.io/assets_coffee_chat/Jay_v2.png)).

So when I reached out to him by email, I made sure to mention these things:

**-------**

*""Hey Jay,*

*International student from Cal, came across your profile - congrats on the job!*

*Wanted to chat about your experience recruiting in tech. Specifically, wanted to ask about:*

1. *How you bring up sponsorship with employers (at what stage, how you frame it etc)*
2. *Your econ background & how this has affected the type of roles you've looked at.*

*Let me know if a quick 20min chat this week would be possible.""*

**--------**

Notice how I didn’t say something generic like: “Would love to pick your brain”

Being specific when reaching out also makes sure that the recipient doesn’t think you’re randomly spamming people and sending the exact same copy to hundreds of people. You’re much more likely to get a response.

Finally, realize that the worst thing that happens is someone says no or doesn’t reply. No big deal, you’re still alive. Realize that most people will ignore your email. That’s okay.

And no, you’re not being “pushy” if you choose to follow-up. Just make sure you’ve taken the steps above to write a good message.

Okay, so let’s assume you’ve got someone to respond and they’re down to have a coffee chat with you. How do you prepare?

**How To Prepare**

Well, firstly, make sure *you do* prepare in advance. Someone’s given you their most valuable asset: their time. Don’t waste it.

When I’m about to speak with someone, I spend a minimum of 1 hour going through their profile and drafting up questions I want to ask them.

I’ll look at their Linkedin profile, see if they’ve published any blog posts, or if they’ve previously spoken on any panels. I’ll compile my notes in a google doc.

If the conversation is going well, you’ll find yourself asking a lot less questions and having a more two-way discussion, but I still recommend doing your research upfront.

When preparing questions, don’t just ask questions you could have looked up. Try to go a layer deeper - so instead of merely asking “Why did you transition into X?”, ask “Given your background in Y, what appealed you to X? Am I right in thinking that given my interests in A & B, I’ll also benefit from a transition into X?”

Ultimately, though, your questions don’t need to be perfect. A coffee chat is just a conversation with another person. And as long as you’re genuinely interested in finding out about their professional journey (rather than begging for a job), you’ll come across well.

**Guiding the Conversation and Asking Questions**

As I hinted at in the last section, whilst you should have a bank of questions to rely on, you don’t want the conversation to just be a series of questions and answers.

Instead, use your questions to add structure to your overall conversation, but let the discussion itself ebb and flow. Go on tangents - if something the other person says catches your interest, don’t be afraid to ask them about it.

There is no script and there shouldn’t be.

Keep in mind, though, that your first few coffee chats *will* likely involve just a bunch of questions and answers. But as you go on more and get more practice, just like anything else, you’ll develop a habit of steering the conversation in a manner that doesn’t involve just Q&A.

Finally, I also recommend taking notes - not necessarily to remember what you discussed, but rather as a tool to highlight the important parts of your conversation and to internalize some of your learnings better.

**Final Thoughts**

Congrats, you’ve just made a new friend!

I recommend following up once right after your chat and sending a nice thank-you note.

Then, in the coming months, if you work on something cool or explore any new opportunities that are related to what you discussed, make sure to let them know!

As a slight tangent - you might be surprised at how many people end up reaching out to *you.*

After one of my coffee chats, I got a recruiter from one of the people I interviewed's company reaching out to me asking if I was interested in a new role they had.

Going on coffee chats is one of the best ways to increase future opportunities that come your way.

All they take is a bit of outreach and prep. And I hope this guide has proven to be a helpful start.

lrkob9,Interview question I generally ask applicants,"Hello all    

I've seen some posts about interview questions here recently and thought I would share some of the questions I ask applicants for our data science positions. Maybe we can have a small discussion on other peoples questions. If you ask why I write this, my small daughter is currently in the hospital and the don't let me in due to Covid rules so I need something to keep me busy (edit: she's fine now).

I currently work in a retail company as a data scientist. We only hire people fresh from university (decision of my bosses) to grow them into the business, usually with master degrees. I studied statistics, therefore it falls to me to assess the statistical knowledge of the applicants.

So what do I look for? We are not a tech or AI company, we need people with a solid understanding of classical statistics, not just ML, as that will be necessary a lot of times. What I want to know is whether the applicant has a good grasp and intuition about statistics. We are a team of people, it is likely someone will know which algorithms and methods might be applicable to your problem, so you don't need to know all the algorithms (you would read up on them anyway), but you need the intuition or training to know that there is a problem (see e.g. my example on multiple testing below). In addition, I personally think that our value doesn't lie in calling fit(X, y), but being able to figure out if the model coming from it is appropriate and useful.

This brings me to the questions I ask. I usually have three questions prepared, which can slightly vary between applicants based on their education. Also I always give applicants my laprop and tell them they can lookup things if they want to.

In the first question, I show a piece of code which generates some data (with p > n) and generates a (collinear) feature. Then a linear model is fitted and the summary printed which is full of NAs. Then I ask them to help me debug why my model gives NAs. This usually leads to a discussion about data quality, features and data preparation.

Then for the second questions, I show the diagnostic plots for a linear regression model I fabricated filled with the usual caveats, heteroskedacity and a missing feature which leads to biased results (e.g. predicts negative values for a strictly positive quantity). Here we have a discussion about model validation and implications of a lack thereof, starting at the given example and then some questions about e.g. cross validation.

And at last my personal favorite, I show people this comic here https://xkcd.com/882/ and ask them to explain it to me. This normally leads to a discussion about p values, hypothesis testing and multiple testing correction, maybe also expectation values. I don't need you to know which algorithm to use (or just p.adjust()), but that you recognize that doing 20 tests without accounting for it is problematic.

This is then followed by a short case study with a problem I solved one or two years ago where I am present and the can discuss with me about what data is available and whether what they propose is feasable. What interests me here the most is not really the idea you come up with but how you get there. What I noticed here is that the people who do well at first try to visualize the problem with some sketches and example cases which really helps them to order their thoughts and me to help them if they get completely stuck.

I hope this read has been helpful or interesting to you, I'd be happy to read about questions you ask in interviews.

o7twn2,Does anyone else feel like their mind is still in work mode even after the end of the work day?,"Hello!

It's just been a year since my first job after graduation and it took me a while to realize this but I just did, that my mind is still working to solve the problem I'm stuck at even on my breaks or while I'm having dinner.

It's not necessarily a bad thing because often those are the times when I actually solve the problem but then again sometimes I am not able to and it's a waste of a break.

Do you guys also can't shut off your mind sometimes and how do you find the perfect balance?

gc29zj,Passed TensorFlow Developer Certification,"Hi,

I have passed this week the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate) from Google. I could not find a lot of feedback here about people taking it so I am writing this post hoping it will help people who want to take it. 

The exam contains 5 problems to solve, part of the code is already written and you need to complete it.  It can last up to 5 hours, you need to upload your ID/Passport and take a picture using your webcam at the beginning, but no one is going to monitor what you do during those 5 hours. You do not need to book your exam beforehand, you can just pay and start right away. There is no restriction on what you can access to during the exam.

I strongly recommend you to take [Coursera's TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice) as the questions in the exam are similar to the exercises you can find in this course. I had previous experience with TensorFlow but anyone with a decent knowledge of Deep Learning and finishes the specialization should be capable of taking the exam.

I would say the big drawback of this exam is the fact you need to take it in Pycharm on your own laptop. I suggest you do the exercises from the Specialization using Pycharm if you haven't used it before (I didn't and lost time in the exam trying to get basic stuff working in Pycharm). I don't have GPU on my laptop and also lost time while waiting for training to be done (never more than \~10mins each time but it adds up), so if you can get GPU go for it! In my opinion it would have make more sense to do the exam in Google Colab... 

Last advice: for multiple questions the source comes from [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets), spend some time understanding the structure of the objects you get as a result from load\_data , it was not clear for me (and not very well documented either!), that's time saved during the exam.

I would be happy to answer other questions if you have some!",427,101,fmarm,2020-05-02 07:13:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gc29zj/passed_tensorflow_developer_certification/,0,datascience

I'm 26 and work as a BI developer/ Data Analyst at a fortune 500 company. My job pays well and I live comfortably. But sometimes I crave a change, a change of company, a change of tools I use at the current job. Using outdated technology right now is kinda the only reason I want to switch.
Then I think if I switch job, it might be a better paying job but could be bad for my work life balance. Right now my work life balance is super, my manager is absolutely fantastic, knows his boundaries, doesn't check my performance in terms of how many hours I'm sitting on my desk.

RSS feed readers ingest content and republish it with credit to the author. This step gives the author added exposure, like how radio stations offer musicians free advertising to sell their music.

Examples of news aggregators include Google News, Drudge Report, Huffington Post, Fark, Zero Hedge, Newslookup, Newsvine, World News (WN) Network and Daily Beast, where the aggregation is entirely automatic

I see that the automated algorithm was incorrectly listing the admin as the author on some of the articles, but there was no intent to deceive. If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of EACH ARTICLE, and that linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR. One more time: If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of each piece that then linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR.

There was no intent to claim ownership. If so, it was a pretty hair-brained try, but I apologize to anyone who feels deserving.

Since I have no financial gain from this site, and no good deed goes unpunished, I decided to take it down. I don't need the aggravation to share useful content and authors if the reward is getting attacked.

I am an awarding winning researcher, as published in at least two national magazines. I don't need anybody else's credibility.

Many articles picked up by the RSS feeds I would be embarrassed to publish under my name.

I am confident that NOBODY, with a clue about data science, thought someone was writing hundreds of articles a week. Especially when posting the ORIGINAL SOURCE, and it links to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR at the bottom of each piece! Seriously!? SERIOUSLY!!!?

I've not made a penny from the site, nor have I ever tried (or wanted to). It was built as a news aggregator to promote the work of others and create a place to stay up to date without navigating to hundreds of sources (yes hundreds). That IS what news aggregators do! I received many thank you notes from authors happy to have extra exposure.

I apologize for my oversite in the way the aggregation algorithm posted. In hindsight, I wish the ""Original Source and Author"" link was on the top rather than the bottom (besides a few other items). I assure you my intent was genuinely excellent; I was trying to give those interested a convenient news aggregation a resource.

I don't create excuses, but please, it is sophomoric to jump from unintentional RSS feed read result to first-degree murder.

Trust me; if anybody worth their weight in Data Science thought you or anybody else got fooled by something so obvious, they would likely think you were in the wrong profession. I asked my 7th-grade daughter to read a few articles and then decipher who the source and author were, and she had NO PROBLEM correctly identifying them (hint, it was not me). I'm pretty sure you can relax.

Again, look at all the ORIGINAL SOURCES and AUTHORS linked to in every case.

I will use the site for personal purposes to save my own time; it got built as my individual RSS reader; I will return it to that.

I apologize to those authors and readers that were happy I had put in the work to create the content aggregation location and add more exposure to others' work. (with zero pay to me)

If you intended to be disruptive, trolling, punitive, and silencing, congratulations, job well done, not worth my time anymore. Honestly, I was getting a little tired of putting in the work anyway. Feel free to navigate the hundreds of sources on your own (yes hundreds); it should only take you 10 or 12 hours a day.

What degree to pursue, PhD or not, Python vs. R, etc.

Successful artists will tell up and coming ones to ""follow their dream"". But the reality is that a more personalized advice should probably be ""follow your dream if you're extremely talented, unique and have the family support to prevent you from ending up homeless"".

I think the same is true of this sub. Not everyone here has the inherent ability to become a Principal Scientist at Google, nor to become the Chief Data Officer for a Fortune 59 company. 
EDIT: I should have said ""not everyone has the right combination of inherent ability, work ethic, and/or life circumstances to become a (...). Inherent ability is one component, but the reality is that there are many reasons why a person may not get there - and not all of them are tied to ability.
Most importantly, not everyone's quality of life will be maximized by pursuing that life.

When you read advice on this sub, always keep a critical eye for how it applies to you, your inherent strengths and weaknesses, your current situation and your future opportunities.

Garth Brooks probably wouldn't take advice from Carrie Underwood. And if you are anything other that a generational talent of a guitar player, you should probably take any advice you get from Steve Vai with a gigantic grain of salt. 

If you're a world leading expert in computer vision, you don't need to take advice from people like me who have worked up the ladder in traditional functions. But if you're someone who doesn't have (and won't have the opportunity to get) a PhD in computer vision from a leading university in the world, then be very weary of taking advice from someone who does at face value - at least without being very aware of how to adapt it to your situation.",419,88,dfphd,2019-12-22 17:59:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ee7xuq/beware_of_taking_advice_from_people_coming_from_a/,0,datascience

l7q12x,Ghosted after 4 successful interviews. Why? I feel devastated,"Mid/Late 2020 I applied for a job. A Sr position in a data eng. related field in a digital services global corporation. The job not only looked good because of the tasks, but also because the service offered by this company is specially interesting for me, and is something I am passionate about. So, I decided to go for it, big time.

After 2 screenings, one pure HHRR and another semi technical, hands on trivial challenge, I was invited for the \*big\* technical case round. As I am also working full time and I wanted to make it perfect, I took 1 week off to prepare the case. I applied all I know, and more, I really put a lot of effort and went the extra mile in every detail. Then, the interview/presentation took place. 2:30 hrs. with 4 interviewers, code discussion, modelling, engineering details, deployment... The presentation was perfect, not only the best I have ever done, but also the best I have seen -I also interviewed people since the early 2000s, and I've seen it all. 20 minutes after the presentation, the leading person -my potential future boss- called me to congratulate me for the outcome and confirm I was going to have the last rounds ASAP.

For the last round I spent my whole holidays preparing everything I could think of, and also understanding the profiles of the people I was going to talk to. The last round was a series of more informal chats with top management profiles, all of them went perfectly, good vibes, nice chats, and I was able to cast some light over challenges they face in their business and propose how to tackle them.

Again, soon my potential future boss called me and let me know that everything went perfect and that I should expect news very soon. We also discussed when I could join, home office situation, the profiles of my potential team, etc...

And that's it.

\+9 weeks passed, I never got any further feedback of any kind. After 1 week I sent a short email, nothing. 2 weeks later, a second one, CCing the HHRR partner involved. Nothing. At some point 2-3 weeks later sent a last short email, and nothing. Complete silence. Nothing. I just stopped trying.

I was interviewed by 7, 8 people, I spent weeks on preparation and did an excellent job. I spend +7 hours in interviews. Why do they do this? I do take it personally, this is not only a frustration considering the job, but also a personal insult.

How is this even possible?

Sorry, I needed to vent.

EDIT. Thanks for all the feedback. Some comments are really interesting and considerate. Just a comment: the reason I am -or was- \*devastated\* (!) was the **ghosting**, not the fact that I did not get the job. I know there are multiple factors I do not control in a process, and that´s fine, is part of the game and I get it. But the ghosting is something that I just can´t cope with. I think it´s rude, unprofessional, unnecessary and simply stupid.

Today post pandemic, Health sectors are being infused from the government with millions of grant dollars to “modernize technologies so they are better prepared for the next crisis.

w44lkv,My company “wants to sell AI” to our clients… how best to manage expectations of an organization that is nowhere near being ready to deploy anything resembling “AI”?,"For context, I work as a “data scientist” at a very small company, specializing in B2B software. Up until recently, I had my hands in a bunch of different things as “the data guy” - running reports, automating processes, etc. It wasn’t much, but it was honest work. My educational background is statistics/analytics. I have quite a bit more business sense than my colleagues - more attracted to practical matters than the shiny academic questions. 

Out of nowhere, our company undergoes a re-org and I find myself with a new manager, a hefty pay raise, and a “director of data science” role. I’m basically led into a meeting with the C-level members of the company, am told that we are “investing heavily in data science” and told that they “want to sell AI to our clients quickly.” Outside of my salary bump, there isn’t any evidence of additional investment in DS. 

Here’s the rub - in order to sell “AI” to clients, we need data and a team to generate these models. We do not collect nor store client data - at all. Functionally, I am the only member of the team (there is another guy on the team but I’m solidly convinced he has absolutely no idea what he’s talking about - he does nothing, doesn’t understand computers, but has been “an AI expert for over 40 years”). There is a member of the board in particular who thinks data science is a magic wand that can be waved at anything to have magic insights pop out. He’s blustery (“JUST GET THE AI TO TELL US THE ANSWER!!”), highly-involved in minute decisions, and has unrealistically-high expectations of my work. Of course, since I am central to many processes across the organization, this work is in addition to everything I did previously.

While I know I can do searches online, my preference for books is that it gives me focus and the tone is consistent to allow me to understand the flow of concepts being described in the book.

Would like your recommendation for a book that:

* Focuses on mathematical proof
* Provides detailed overview of methods and describes the limitations and conditions of each test (e.g. What is the description of Chi-Square test? Interpretation of ANOVA test values? Circumstances and underlying conditions needed for each of the methods of hypothesis testing?)
* Uses examples to demonstrate the concepts shared
* Not dense with text (sometimes the authors just love to write so much for no reason)

mhvr1h,Just failed an interview but I have a feeling that the interviewer is wrong,"So I had a technical take-home challenge. Due to having to do machine learning on a laptop and having 100 million records, I took a random sample of the data (or more accurately only 1% because that's all my laptop can handle). I proceeded to do EDA, train data and fit a few models that looked well fitting.

This is retail data and my interviewer immediately told me that my random sample approach is wrong. He said that I should have taken a few stores at random and then used ALL their data (as in full data for all the stores picked) to train the models. According to him, you can't train the model unless you have every single data point for a store. I think that he doesn't seem to understand the concept of random sampling.

I actually think both approaches are reasonable, but that his claim of needing every single data point for a store or you are not getting the ""full picture"" is incorrect.

I failed the challenge due to this issue and that was literally the only thing that was wrong with my solution (according to feedback I asked for) :(

gwibmc,My thoughts on the data science job hunt during COVID-19,"Some background: I have 6 years of DS experience, 2 masters degrees, and spent a few years as a data analyst as well. Laid off from a smaller company in the midwest due to COVID-19 cutbacks.

&#x200B;

1. **""Data scientist"" is turning into a blanket term. So is ""data analyst"".** So many of the jobs I've looked at truly want a data engineer/DBA but ask for a data scientist. Or want a data scientist but ask for an entry level data analyst. Expand your search terms, but read the job description to figure out what the company really wants. This changes every time I'm on the job market even in my short tenure as a data scientist. When did ""Machine Learning Engineer"" become so big??
2. **On that note: ""Senior"" vs ""Lead"" vs ""Entry Level""**...the difference to me is huge, but most companies seem to be pretty flexible with what they're posting. Some entry level jobs have been open to changing to senior level, some lead/manager level would be fine with senior. If you like a job but are weary about the experience required, just ask the hiring manager/recruiter that posted it.
3. **Every company has a different way of testing your knowledge.** So far I've taken a data science timed assessment (no outside resources), completed a take-home assessment (48 hours and a dataset), and presented a past project for 30 minutes, all for different companies. Be prepared for just about anything, but use how they test you as a clue into their culture. For me, I love the take-home tests and presentations because they give me a chance to show what I know without as much of the pressure.
4. **Companies are starting to open back up.** Many job postings were taken down from March-May, but as of today the number of openings is expanding rapidly. Region may be a big factor. The companies I have interviewed with have stuck to either all virtual, or majority virtual with one in-person interview with masks and social distancing.

ok5xpq,Why Managers matter?,"There was an earlier [discussion about career paths](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ojobxx/what_are_the_typical_stages_in_a_data_science/), and in writing a reply I ended up writing an entire post, so I figured I would post it as such.

The topic of conversation was ""what is harder to replace: a strong individual contributor or a good manager?"".

Personally, I think they're both equally hard to replace assuming we're comparing apples to apples (e.g., if we're talking about the expert with 20 years of experience, then we should be comparing them to an SVP of DS with 20 years experience).

u/jturp-sc then mentioned that people often undervalue the contribution of managers. Which I think is true of a lot of individual contributors. That is, they see their managers as purely paper pushers, and they tend to greatly underestimate the effort that seemingly simple things like project managent take.

I like to use the following analogy:

When in college, I played in a rec soccer league with a bunch of friends, including my two roommates.

Roommate number 1 was the typical forward - fast, great shot, *loved* to have the ball, loved to score, loved to brag about scoring. Was altogether a very strong player.

Roommate number 2 was the opposite. Low key guy, didn't have a great shot, wasn't very fast. On paper, not a great soccer player. But he had really good vision and was a really good passer.

The last season before roommate 2 left the team we lost one game and played in the finals.

The first season after roommate 2 lef the team we lost all but 1 game. Literally everyone was playing worse. People were getting frustrated at how bad we were playing, so they were making bad decisions and making it even worse.

No one talked about it, but I actually reached out to former roommate and told him - ""dude, without you, we're lost. I never appreciated how much value you brought to this team, but it's so easy to see now"".

Because his job was to create opporuntities. Sure, you still need other people to capitalize on the opportunities, but someone needs to create them first.

In soccer, it means that for a forward to score, someone needs to get them the ball either close to the goal with an open look, or in stride and in space against a single defender. Sure, every once in a while a forward will take on 2-3 guys and score anyway, but that is not a recipe for success - that ends up being more luck than anything. Moreover, for you to win games you need to stop the other team from scoring more goals than your forwards can score. So while your forward may get all the glory in a 1-0 win, what people often forget is that your defense and goalie had to keep that ""0"" intact.

In data science, it means that for a data scientist to build and deploy a model (i.e., to capitalize), *and for the organization to realize and recognize the value of said model*, someone needs to create the opportunity. Someone needs to argue that the model should be built in the first place - that there is a real business problem that can be tackled with data science. Someone needs to get it to the top of the priority queue - convincing leadership that the model should be worked on *now* instead of a different problem. Someone needs to get business stakeholders, IT, software development, etc., to commit time and resources to support the project. And then someone needs to take a good model and cram it down people's throats until they agree to use it.

Not only that, someone needs to make sure that your team doesn't get flooded with shitty request. Someone also needs to make sure that you are constantly advocating for people to get paid market value, to continue to add headcount, to avoid taking on too much tech debt, to have the organization invest in resources, etc.

For the first 2 years of my career as an individual contributor, I was never aware of 90% of that stuff that my boss was doing. At some point I became her right-hand person, and that's when she started sharing some of the things that I didn't get to see. The hour-long meeting to get software to allocate 1/8th of a resource to do QA for one of our projects. The one hour meeting with IT to get us time on the big-ass server to run a simulation that was going to take 1 week and was due in 8 days. The 2-hour meeting with product development about why we can't do the equivalent of reversing physics to deliver on the dumb-ass idea that a salesperson sold to a client. The days/weeks worth of legwork to get us an additional hire approved. The 6-8 standing weekly meetings on her calendar.

All of the sudden I realized ""she is spending 80% of her time doing the things I didn't even know existed, and 20% of her time doing the things I thought were her full time job"".

I also got close with one of our expert data scientists. Great guy - 20 years of experience, a walking statistics encyclopedia, and incredibly nice (to anyone who wasn't an idiot). Do you know what shocked me? The level of respect that he had for the people who weren't in an expert role. He had been around for 20 years, and had gotten to see people like my boss do all the dirty work for him. He got to show up and do the things he enjoyed doing - but he know that the reason for that was that other people in the building were having to go eat shit sandwiches with a smile to keep the operation rolling.

We had two experts who had the opporuntity (more than once) to take over the department and become VP. They both passed. I presume they both laughed first, then passed.

Which one is more valuable? I honestly don't know. I honestly don't think it makes sense to try to establish who is more valuable - you need them both. If you're going to build a world-class (or even good) data science team, you need to have both types. You need to have the people who have a mathematical 6th gear that they can tap into. But you also need the people who have 4-wheel drive and can go 10mph over a swamp.",403,102,dfphd,2021-07-14 14:51:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ok5xpq/why_managers_matter/,0,datascience

l4zbd9,Did anyone regret choosing DS as a career or has got disillusioned with it?,"**TL;DR** I've been a Data Scientist for 6 years now and with time I've grown quite bored and disillusioned with it, and I wanted to figure out if it has happened to anyone else or I'm kinda weird :)

Fellow Data Scientists,

I have a very unusual question to ask you. 

I originally got into the Data and Analytics space working in Operations Research for a large ecommerce and logistic company. From there I became a Data Analyst for a successful mobile app and then a Data Scientist for a boutique consulting company. I currently work on building and deploying ML models for large clients on the Azure ecosystem. I also volunteer as a Project Manager for a Data charity. I basically experienced it all.

Education-wise, I have a MSc in Industrial Engineering and Management with a specialisation in Operations Research / Mathematical Optimisation, and a MSc in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning from a top university in the UK, both degrees awareded with Distinction. I also co-authored 7 research papers on ML in journals and conferences.

Sounds like a great career, doesn't it? Actually, I never truly enjoyed it despite Data Science is such a ""cool"" career on paper.

The things that bother me are:

1. I feel I am neither meat nor fish. Not technically skilled enough to be a Software Developer and being more involved in the development of the key features of the product, nor soft skilled enough to play a pivotal role with the Product / Business / Operations Management team.
2. I've experienced how difficult is for a Data Scientist to change career path within an organisation. My experience has always been that people who don't have our background tend to see us like curious animals who only love to play with data and to code, and as a result of that we tend to be pigeonholed into our roles and discarded if any interesting opportunities arise within other departments of the company, despite our Subject Matter Expertise, excitement for the product / business and any soft skills we might have.
3. I've noticed how DSs are almost never recognised and praised by the company's leadership team for their work, as opposed to Business Managers, PMs, SWEs, Marketing Managers and Designers.
4. I miss the ""tangible"" outcome of my work. For most of the day I sit (often lonely) producing code, but I cannot touch nor see the output of my code, and that's frustrating because I feel that I cannot share my achievements with others including my family. I think that if I were a Civil Engineer or even a Software Developer I feel I could feel way more excited about what I produce.

I am not looking for advice on how to mitigate my circumnstances, at the end of the day I've decided that I will retrain myself in the field of Chemical or Sustainable Energy Engineering to overcome this disappointment and work on more ""meaningful"" projects, and if I could go back in time I'd not get into Data Science again. But I wanted to ask if you (or someone you know) have ever felt the same sense of disillusionment, or is it just me (I've asked a few DSs in person and no one has felt like this - apart for not being praised properly).

Thank you, and sorry for the long essay!",400,135,boredmanonthemoon,2021-01-25 22:27:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/l4zbd9/did_anyone_regret_choosing_ds_as_a_career_or_has/,0,datascience

v8qv68,I'm just going to say it - I prefer Spyder,"From my research online, people either use notebooks or they jump straight to VS Code or Pycharm.  This might be an unpopular opinion,  but I prefer Spyder for DS work.  Here are my main reasons:

1) '# % %' creates sections.  I know this exists in VS Code too but the lines disappear if you're not immediately in that section.  It just ends up looking cluttered to me in VS Code.

2) Looking at DFs is so much more pleasing to the eye in Spyder.  You can have the variable explorer open in a different window.  You can view classes in the variable explorer.  

3) Maybe these options exist in VS Code an Pycharm but I'm unaware of it, but I love hot keys to run individual lines or highlighted lines of code.  

4) The debugger works just as well in my opinion.

Does anyone have any recommendations about industries/companies/job titles to explore that give data scientists the scope to come up with new projects and where there isn't a strong product owner/technical divide?

Edit: Wow data people. Thanks for the responses! Been really interesting to read the diverging opinions and advice.

rgyy8m,I got a data science job interview that I am under-qualified for. What can I do in one month to maximize my chances?,"I just got a job interview for a data science position that requires data science experience. The position offers double my current salary but asks for experience that I lack. If I can get it, I'll be over the moon. Luckily, because of the holidays, I was given an interview in mid-January and was wondering if there is anything I can do in a month to maximize my chances of getting it.

To provide some context, I am a marketing data analyst (with less than a year of experience in the industry) who just completed a 6-month data science course. I learned a lot from the course, but don't have enough practical experience. This position asks for experience in two ML algorithms  (boosting, clustering). I am willing to grind for the next month if it meant that my chances of getting this position would increase. What can be done?

Edit: For those who think that I ""faked it"", I never wrote anything that isn't accurate on my resume. It's the first interview I've got after many rejections. Just because someone gets an interview for a position that requires more experience, it doesn't mean that they lied in their application.

Edit #2: I'm thankful for all the support I'm getting from this community. I'll definitely be going through those and working through them. As mentioned, even if I don't get the position, at least I would have gained a decent amount of experience that would help me in future opportunities! Thank you, everyone.

kv8hpb,Low Quality TowardsDataScience & Medium Articles,"I'm interested in getting people's opinions on DS blog sites like TDS / Medium. When I was a lot less experienced, I'd often find really great articles on TDS that helped me understand some method or concept. As time's gone by, I still do the occasional search to try and find some article that explains a difficult or complex issue but I'm getting the impression that these sites are getting absolutely swamped by extremely low quality articles and it's effectively ruining any usefulness they once had.

Generally, I'm finding the bulk of them fall into one of two categories: 1) An extremely shallow explanation of something or 2) A far too complex explanation that isn't suitable for someone who generally understands DS but not this particular concept. To me, both of these suggest that the author doesn't really know what they're talking about and are essentially just regurgitating content they've found elsewhere.

it strikes me that a lot of the authors I see are students who're basically attempting to drive clicks through clickbait type titles in some effort to boost their reputation or CV.

Am I being too harsh? There are some fantastic DS bloggers / vloggers out there but what makes them great is their ability to explain a topic they understand in depth in a way that makes it easily understandable to the audience. The vast majority of the articles I see these days seem to be by people who either don't have much understanding of the topic and/or don't have the ability to explain it well.

It's a real shame because there's definitely a space online for some kind of DS community where genuine experts can share their knowledge and understanding but it seems to me that's being swamped by the billionth article on 'Linear regression explained simply' by a first year college student.",391,153,ghostofkilgore,2021-01-11 18:21:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/kv8hpb/low_quality_towardsdatascience_medium_articles/,0,datascience

.



After a month long process I GOT THE JOB!!! Found out about an hour ago, junior data scientist in the South florida area, 80k a year (100k with performance bonuses plus benefits). 


For anyone who wants advice or to familiarize themselves with how the process was:


Step 1) saw ad on linked in, sent my CV 


Step 2) Email with a take home project, they have us a 1 GB database and we had to make a predictive model for a churn rate after 2 years. Basically we had 5 linked dataframes one with customer information (2 million observations) and then 4 other data sets with 5-15 millions observations. Had to reduce it to one data frame. As in add a variable from the other data sets to the customer one based on customer ID i.e create stuff like age variable, account balance, number of services hired, credit score at the time they applied (trickiest one), and contract duration from the 4 other data sets.


Final DF was 1.5 million then had to filter by desired population, with all the filters the DF was only 35k observations and that's what I ran my models on.


It took about 6 hours but I googled A LOT of stuff #stackoverflow. I could've used mysql for the first part but they asked for the whole script in R or Python (I used R). I kept it simple did a Logit, a random forest and a SVM. Error rate with cross validation was about 15%, svm was the best model, baseline was 30%. Asked to make a ppt.




Step 3)  Phone interview asking about my degree and internship experience, 15 minutes told me at the end they want me to come to a face to face



Step 4) face to face interview, 30 minutes with the heads of the team I'd be in, asked why I like the industry, why this firm, where i see myself down the line, about potentially leaving, in depth questions about my undergrad degree and what I did in my internships. Afterwards they took a 15 questions multiple choice math test, (it was like the generic sat/gre math part). 



Step 5) interview with regional manager 30 minutes, more personal questions, talked a lot about the company and my role, what where my expectations, benefits, etc. At the end he took a 3 question test, one was what the angle of a triangle at 3:15 in a wall clock is, the second was why are manholes round, and another was how many cars do I think were sold in the U.S in 2019. 


Step 6) confirmation call!


My degree was a bs in economics with a specialization in econometrics and a minor in stats! Top 40 school ranked nationally. Hope this helps anyone applying!


.

Edit: Well apparently this is considered a very rigorous process and I agree, I have other friends who got similar jobs with easier processes. However it's my first job right out of college (december grad) and I only had 1 year experience. Also with bonuses I can expect to make about 100k so I think it's fair.

19d5ydb,I just realized i dont know python,"For a while I was thinking that i am fairly good at it.  I work as DS and the people I work with are not python masters too. This led me belive I am quite good at it.  I follow the standards and read design patterns as well as clean code.

Today i saw a job ad on Linkedin and decide to apply it.  They gave me 30 python questions (not algorithms) and i manage to do answer 2 of them.

My self perception shuttered and i feel like i am missing a lot.  I have couple of projects i am working on and therefore not much time for enjoying life.  How much i should sacrifice more ?  I know i can learn a lot if i want to . But I am gonna be 30 years old tomorrow and I dont know how much more i should grind.

I also miss a lot on data engineering and statistics. It is too much to learn.  But on the other hand if i quit my job i might not find a new one.

Edit: I added some questions here.  

First image is about finding the correct statement. Second image another question.

16h8ovh,Today I had a beautiful moment that I had to share,"This is going to be somewhat long. I apologize but I have to share. 

Last summer, completely against my will, I was told that I had to manage a high school intern who was in a program to prepare for college. The program was to get hands on experience at a company before they went to school so they could decide a career path with more information on what the day to day is like in the workplace.

When I met this student, he informed me the program randomly placed the kids into jobs blindly. He had no idea what I did or what he was going to do. When I told him I am a data scientist, he was not happy and had no interest at all. He was hoping for a sales or marketing placement as that is more interesting to him.

The first week did not go well at all. He was very disinterested and vocal about it. So at the end of the week we did our required weekly progress report and I just begged him to give it a chance, because if he did poorly, we’re both going to look bad. 

Over the course of the 4 months he was with me, we spent afternoons completing complex problems, learning various programs, and making key business decisions using data driven decision making. I taught him SQL, R, Python, and power bi-automate. The kid was a natural. As a junior in high school he picked everything up faster than any university intern or junior I have ever trained. 

When our time was up. He thanked me for the opportunity and admitted while it was far from a career path he would choose, he learned a lot of valuable lessons and appreciated the experience. I attended his “graduation ceremony” from the program, we said our goodbyes, and parted ways. 


Here is where it gets just crazy. This morning, he sent me a long message on LinkedIn, wondering if I remembered him. And told me how inspiring our time was together. So much so that when he graduated this summer, he decided that he chose his college major (computer science & statistics) because of how gratifying the work we did was and how interested in data he became during our time. 

I’ll admit, I bawled like a baby. I was so honored to receive that message, and it was so gratifying for myself to be able to get through to someone like that. 

TL:DR you never know who you can inspire, doing what we love with a passion.",388,15,TheGreenBackPack,2023-09-13 00:50:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16h8ovh/today_i_had_a_beautiful_moment_that_i_had_to_share/,2,datascience

11cf8mk,"Hired by a company as the sole data scientist. The management does not understand what data science is, but want to say they are doing it. Anyone else experiencing this?","I was hired as a graduate from a machine learning master during the pandemic, after coming from a computer science background. I am at an organisation of about 350 staff and work mostly by myself, a couple of other guys do a bit of data stuff and we have no project manager.

My actual boss has no clue about Data Science or what is needed to deliver models to production. I have tried to express that the team needs some leadership but he says it will not happen until I can prove ML is useful. I am under a fair amount of pressure to deliver something useful.

10vynlk,"I'm the only ""data scientist"" at my company and have lost all motivation and want to leave but feel bad. Any advice?","Don't want to give too much away, but I'm in my mid-20s and work as the only data scientist at a smallish (<100 people) startup. I'm in my second year in the role, and although I enjoyed my first year very much, I've noticed that I've really been not having a good time lately. There are a few reasons for this:

* I don't have a team. It was pretty fun at first to come in and take care of a lot of low-hanging fruit and answer people's data questions that they'd been stuck with for a long time. But I don't feel like I'm learning anything new anymore, and I'm not experienced enough to figure out how I can make myself progress. My manager is great but does not have a background in data science, and I don't have peers I can discuss my work with.
* Our leadership doesn't really understand data analysis. The CEO is always asking for ""insights"" as if I can just comb through our database and magically come up with recommendations for how to improve the business. In short, because I'm the only person doing any sort of analysis, and our engineering team is pretty lean and doesn't particularly focus on data collection/integrity/etc., it can be hard to even get an analysis started (and I always have to push really hard to e.g. get engineering to set up the data tracking I need). When I have presented data analyses that I've done, I've noticed that the CEO only cares about findings that affirm what he already believes, which is really annoying because at that point, why should I even put in any effort?
* I have to do a lot of stuff that isn't really relevant to my role because I'm the only one who can do it. For example, our finance team relies on me for a lot of important reporting (e.g. when we are talking to investors), and I end up being the person who has to put together long financial reports (which isn't so bad) and audit/reconcile different metrics when they don't look right or don't match between sources (which is really quite terribly boring). To be fair, my job description does include making dashboards and reports, but it's gotten to the point where my day-to-day is often answering questions like ""why doesn't this number \[pulled from our prod database\] not match this other number \[displayed on some dashboard I know nothing about that was made by some random engineer\]"" or ""do we track \[x metric\] somewhere and where can I find it"" (the answer is no, we don't, so I need to go meet with engineering to set it up).
* Finally, our leadership has constantly pivoted business models during the time I've been here. I get that we're in tough times and startups need to be flexible, but at this point, the product is pretty different from what it was when I came in, and I'm not that excited about it anymore. So there isn't even motivation from believing in the product anymore.

I've been thinking a lot about this and feel like I should probably quit my job and find a new one where I am a bit better supported and can have some more mentorship. This is only my second job out of college, and while I've learned a lot from being the only person in this role, I think I want to be in an environment where I can get some more direct guidance - often, I'm not sure if what I'm doing is anywhere near what's considered ""best practice"". But I'd feel bad about just completely ditching the company. My coworkers are so nice, and I'm the only person who knows both our database and our BI platform well enough to generate reports/dashboards efficiently, so I think it would be very bad if I just quit one day, even with a two-week notice.

Any advice on how to deal with this situation? Sorry for the long post.",384,108,throaway05282016,2023-02-07 10:31:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10vynlk/im_the_only_data_scientist_at_my_company_and_have/,0,datascience

j6uqn9,Excel is Gold,"So i am working for a small/medium sized company with around 80 employees as Data Scientist / Analyst / Data Engineer / you name it. There is no real differentiation. I have my own vm where i run ETL jobs and created a bunch of apis and set up a small UI which nobody uses except me lol. My tasks vary from data cleaning for external applications to performance monitoring of business KPIs, project management, creation of dashboards, A/B testing and modelling, tracking and even scraping our own website. I am mainly using Python for my ETL processes, PowerBI for Dashboards, SQL for... data?! and EXCEL. Lots of Excel and i want to emphasise on why Excel is so awesome (at least in my role, which is not well defined as i pointed out). My usual workflow is: i start with a python script where i merge the needed data (usually a mix of SQL and some csv's and xlsx), add some basic cleaning and calculate some basic KPIs (e.g. some multivariate Regression, some distribution indicators, some aggregates) and then.... EXCEL

So what do i like so much about Excel?

First: Everybody understands it!   
This is key when you dont have a team who all speak python and SQL. Excel is just a great communication Tool. You can show your rough spreadsheet in a Team meeting (especially good in virtual meetings) and show the others your idea and the potential outcome. You can make quick calculations and visuals based on questions and suggestions live. Everybody will be on the same page without going through abstract equations or code. I made the experience that its usually the specific cases that matter. Its that one row in your sheet which you go through from beginning to end and people will get it when they see the numbers. This way you can quickly interact with the skillset of your team and get useful information about possible flaws or enhancements of your first approach of the model.

Second: Scrolling is king!  
I often encounter the problem of developing very specific KPIs/ Indicators on a very very dirty dataset. I usually have a soffisticated idea on how the metric can be modelled but usually the results are messy and i dont know why. And no: its not just outliers :D There are so many business related factors that can play a role that are very difficult to have in mind all the time. Like what kind of distribution channel was used for the sales, was the item advertised, were vouchers used, where there problems with the ledger, the warehouse, .... the list goes on. So to get hold of the mess i really like scrolling data. And almost all the time i find simething that inspires me on how to improve my model, either by adding filters or just understanding the problem a little bit better. And Excel is in my opinion just the best tool for the task. Its just so easy to quickly format and filter your data in order to identify possible issues. I love pivoting in excel, its just awesome easy. And scrolling through the data gives me the feeling of beeing close to the things happening in the business. Its like beeing on the street and talking to the people :D

Third (and last): Mockups and mapping

In order to simulate edge cases of your model without writing unit-tests for which you dont have time, i find it very useful to create small mockup tables where you can test your idea. This is especially usieful for the development of features for your model. I often found that the feature that i was trying to extract did not behave in the way i intended. Sure you can quickly generate some random table in python but often random is not what you want. you want to test specific cases and see if the feature makes sense in that case.  
Then you have mapping of values or classes or whatever. Since excel is just so comfortable it is just the best for this task. I often encountered that mapping rules are very fuzzy defined in the business. Sometimes a bunch of stakeholders is involved and everybody just needs to check for themselves to see if their needs are represented. After the process is finished that map can go to SQL and eventually updates are done. But in that eary stage Excel is just the way to go.

Of course Excel is at the same time very limited and it is crucial to know its limits. There is a close limit of rows and columns that can be processed without hassle on an average computer. Its not supposed to be part of an ETL process. Things can easily go wrong.   
But it is very often the best starting point.

I hope you like Excel as much as me (and hate it at the same time) and if not: consider!

I also would be glad to hear if people have made similar experiences or prefer other tools.",385,150,magicpeanut,2020-10-07 17:05:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/j6uqn9/excel_is_gold/,0,datascience

16m7re1,You all need to think more like a company when working in a company.,"There's been a lot of complaining about stakeholders expectations on data scientists here lately.

This is not a good mindset and it's certainly not a good influence on those here new to the field.

&#x200B;

1. (almost) Every employer is in the business of making money. We are paid well because (presumably) what we do makes that goal happen more. It's that simple. But the work a data scientist does is not valuable if it does not end up either making more money enter the company, or making less money leave the company. If you are working on a project and you can not explain how it will result in one or both of those things happening (indirectly counts), you need to take a step back and figure that out.
2. If sales or leadership is asking you to give them simple explanations, it's not because they need you to explain your degree in three sentences. They are asking you to explain *which actual outcome becomes different when whatever you are building is added*, so that they can *help you sell your work to customers or downstream users,* and for you to indicate *what time and resources you need to make that happen*. Again, if you can not identify the action or decision which ends up different once your solution is in place, and describe how you optimize that outcome, you should be sceptical as to whether it is actually impactful.
3. When you are asked to outline deliverables, they are *letting you explain to them in what way you prefer to deliver your value added*. That is giving you the power. They are not asking you to do more work in a shorter time. They are asking you what will come out of your work, and what steps you (and they) will need to take to make that outcome happen. *Surely* the work you did two weeks ago (last sprint, if you will) is feeding into work you are doing now or at some point down the line. *The way it does so - is the deliverable of the work you did two weeks ago*. Even if that is a documented (positive or negative) outcome of an experiment. I refuse to believe that people with a master's degree or PhD in an engineering- or scientific field are not able to break their work down into steps if they put their mind to it.

nqnrs6,I researched the origin of Unlimited PTO (at Netflix) and wrote up a case study :),"Unlimited PTO (paid-time-off). Some love it, others think it’s a scam.

But it’s worth exploring why this policy was implemented in the first place. And for that, we go back to the early days at Netflix.

It’s 2003. Netflix is galloping along in pursuit of Blockbuster. There’s a buzz around the office. The chase is on and an employee asks:

*""'We are all working online some weekends, responding to emails at odd hours, taking off an afternoon for personal time. We don't track hours worked per day or week. Why are we tracking days of vacation per year?""*

Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, doesn’t really have a great answer. After all, he’s always judged performance without looking at hours. Get the job done in 1 hour or 10 hours? Doesn’t matter as long as you're doing good work.

Hastings also realizes that some of the best ideas at work come after someone’s just taken vacation. They’ve got the mental bandwidth to think about their work in a fresh, creative manner. Something that’s not possible if you’re clocking in and out without any rest.

So Hastings decides to pull the trigger. He introduces Netflix’s *No Vacation Policy* which puts the onus on their employees to decide when and how much vacation they need to take.

In his book, *No Rules Rules*, Hastings describes getting nightmares when he first introduced this policy. In one of these nightmares, he’d drive to the office, park his car, and walk into a completely empty building.

Those nightmares, minus a few blips which we’ll get to in a bit, never really materialized. The policy was a success and soon other companies in the Valley started copying Netflix. Everybody wanted the best talent and implementing a no rules vacation policy seemed like a great differentiator.

Except that the same policy which worked so well for Netflix...wasn’t working for anyone else.

Other companies found that after implementing an unlimited PTO type policy, employees paradoxically started to take *less* vacation. They would worry that their co-workers would think they were slacking off or that they would get left behind come promotion time.

Hastings was surprised. After a bit of digging, he realized the reason behind why these policies had failed.

The leaders at these companies were not modelling big vacation taking.

Indeed, if the execs were only taking 10 days off, then the unlimited plan would deter other employees from taking anywhere near that amount or more than that.

As Hastings put it:

*“In the absence of a policy, the amount of vacation people take largely reflects what they see their boss and colleagues taking.”*

**Modelling others around you**

This concept of modelling others around us applies not only to vacation taking, but to all sorts of behaviors. As we continue to move towards a new distributed, remote-first workforce, there’s going to be a lot of ambiguity in the decisions that we need to make.

The companies that are able to best adapt to this changing environment will be the ones in which leaders model the right set of behaviors.

A big one will be written communication. As the ability to just randomly walk up to someone at the office and ask them a question subsides, we’ll need to document our practices much better and be able to communicate much more efficiently.

The more we see others, especially our leaders, invest in written communication and take the time to get better at it, the more we will do it.

And never mind us seeing them do this. Reed Hastings wants them to shout loud and clear just how much vacation they’re taking or just how much they’re investing in themselves, so as to encourage everyone else to do it.

An example of good modelling in practice is Evernote. The company, which also doesn’t limit employee vacation days, actually gives a $1,000 stipend to anyone who takes an entire week off in order to encourage vacation taking ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2013/08/13/the-catch-of-having-an-unlimited-vacation-policy/)).

**Other Things**

Okay, so there was one more thing that Reed Hastings found out. It wasn’t enough for leaders to just model the right behavior. They also had to set context and guidelines.

Reed realized this when it was the end of quarter and his accounting team was supposed to be closing up their financial books. But a member of the team, in an attempt to avoid the annual crunch period, took off the first two weeks of January. No bueno.

So Reed decided to put in place clear parameters and guidelines on what was acceptable within the context of taking time off. For example, it was imperative to mention things like how many people taking time off at the same time is acceptable and how managers must be notified well in advance of any such long vacations.

This would help prevent blows like the one above in the accounting department.

**Conclusion**

In the end, it seems like Unlimited PTO can work, but it also needs to be supported with strong management. Individuals need to model big vacation taking and put into place the right guidelines.

But I think the lessons here go beyond just vacation.

The behaviors we see and notice from those around us eventually have a strong impact on the type of people that we become. This is especially true at the managerial level, where the impact is 1 to N and can result in considerable [cultural debt](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/cultural-debt).

So just like this question of unlimited vacation, the answer usually lies in its implementation. Context is king. But that does't always make for good headlines, now, does it.

150rn3c,Normalize writing good code,"The hardest part of ML is reading code written by other data scientists. Even code written by the highest level ML practitioners is atrocious. It is hard to learn new things from poorly written code. You either spend way too much time trying to follow their confusing logic, or you simply copy and paste and dont learn anything. It doesnt have to be this way!

Can we normalize coding good practices in data science?

Here are some suggestions:
1. Stop using long functions. Break complex logic into pieces.
2. Stop using massive one-liners to do complex data manipulation
3. Use type annotations and type hinting in function declarations
4. Use docstrings to describe what a function does, its inputs, and return values and types
5. Stop using global variables",372,108,jankybiz,2023-07-16 00:22:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/150rn3c/normalize_writing_good_code/,0,datascience

There’s the stuff I do every day, like computing basic summary statistics since I work mainly with categorical data, but also things like linear regression, various significance tests (t-test, chi squared), to more “complicated” techniques such as decision trees, and even things like forecasting.

However, every time I spend a few weeks away from one of these things (like decision trees), I completely forget how they work. I can remember things like there’s nodes and branches and it makes splits based on entropy, but beyond that it’s like I’ve forgotten everything I’ve read.

n9aj13,"Rant: If your company's interview process can be ""practiced"" for, it's probably not a very good one","The data science interview process is something that we have seen evolve over the last 5-10 years, taking on several shapes and hitting specific fads along the way. Back when DS got popular, the process was a lot like every other interview process - questions about your resume, some questions about technical topics to make sure that you knew what a person in that role should know, etc.

Then came the ""well, Google asks people these weird, seemingly nonsensical questions and it helps them *understand how you think!"".* So that became the big trend - how many ping pong balls can you fit into this room, how many pizzas are sold in Manhattan every day, etc.

Then came the behavioralists. Everything can be figured out by asking questions of the format ""tell me about a time when..."".

Then came leetcode (which is still alive).

Then came the FAANG ""product interview"", which has now bred literal online courses in how to pass the product interview.

I hit the breaking point of frustration a week ago when I engaged with a recruiter at one of these companies and I was sent a link to several medium articles to prepare for the interview, including one with a line so tone-deaf (not to be coming from the author of the article, but to be coming from the recruiter) that it left me speechless:

>As I describe my own experience, I can’t help thinking of a **common misconception** I often hear: it’s not possible to gain the knowledge on product/experimentation without real experience. I firmly disagree. I did not have any prior experience in product or A/B testing, but I believed that those skills could be gained by reading, listening, thinking, and summarizing. 

I'll stop here for a second, beacause I know I'm going to get flooded hate. I agree  - you can 100% acquire enough knowledge about a topic to pass ""know"" enough to pass a screening. However, there is always a gap between knowing something on paper and in practice - and in fact, that is *exactly* the gap that you're trying to quantify during an interview process.  

And this is the core of my issue with interview processes of this kind: if the interview process is one that a person can prepare for, then what you are evaluating people on isn't their ability to the job - you're just evaluating them on their ability to prepare for your interview process. And no matter how strong you think the interview process is as a proxy for that person's ability to do the actual job, the more efficiently someone can prepare for the interview, the weaker that proxy becomes.

To give an analogy - I could probably get an average 12 year old to pass a calculus test without them ever actually understanding calculus if someone told me in advance what were the 20 most likely questions to be asked. If I know the test is going to require taking the derivative of 10 functions, and I knew what were the 20 most common functions, I can probably get someone to get 6 out of 10 questions right and pass with a C-. 

It's actually one of the things that instructors in math courses always try (and it's not easy) to accomplish - giving questions that are not foreign enough to completely trip up a student, while simultaneously different enough to not be solvable through sheer memorization. 

As others have mentioned in the past, part of what is challenging about designing interview processes is controlling for the fact that most people are bad at interviewing. The more scripted, structured, rigid the interview process is, the easier it is to ensure that interviewers can execute the process correctly (and unbiasedly).

The problem - the trade-off - is that in doing so you are potentially developing a really bad process. That is, you may be sacrificing accuracy for precision. 

Is there a magical answer? Probably not. The answer is probably to invest more time and resources in ensuring that interviewers can be equal parts unpredictable in the nature of their questions and predictable in how they execute and evaluate said questions. 

But I think it is very much needed to start talking about how this process is likely broken - and that the quality of hires that these companies are making is much more driven by their brand, compensation, and ability to attract high quality hires than it is by filtering out the best ones out of their candidate pool.",374,96,dfphd,2021-05-10 17:16:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/n9aj13/rant_if_your_companys_interview_process_can_be/,0,datascience
1114q7e,Ghost papers provided by ChatGPT,"So, I started using ChatGPT to gather literature references for my scientific project. Love the information it gives me, clear, accurate and so far correct. It will also give me papers supporting these findings when asked. 

HOWEVER, none of these papers actually exist. I can't find them on google scholar, google, or anywhere else. They can't be found by title or author names. When I ask it for a DOI it happily provides one, but it either is not taken or leads to a different paper that has nothing to do with the topic. I thought translations from different languages could be the cause and it was actually a thing for some papers, but not even the english ones could be traced anywhere online.

Does ChatGPR just generate random papers that look damn much like real ones?

Now, don't get me wrong, I understand these are quite important and it makes sense why a client would really like these. But for data science tasks presented they seem more ""That's interesting, but meh. Anyways, about that serverless architecture"".

So I'm not sure if it's just the clients I work with, but I also see job postings and there are way more infrastructure/cloud/data engineer postings than data science or ML Engineer jobs.

mgczg1,Hostile members of an interview panel - how to handle it?,"I had this happen twice during my 2 months of a job search. I am not sure if I am the problem and how to deal with it.

This is usually into multi-stage interview process when I have to present a technical solution or a case study. It's a week long take home task that I spend easily 20-30 hours on of my free time because I don't like submitting low quality work (I could finish it in 10 hours if I really did the bare minimum).

So after all this, I have to present it to a panel. Usually on my first or second slide, basically that just describes my background, someone cuts in. First time it happened, a most senior guy cut in and said that he doesn't think some of my research interests are exactly relevant to this role. I tried nicely to give him few examples of situations that they would be relevant in and he said ""Yeah sure but they are not relevant in other situations"". I mean, it's on my CV, why even let me invest all the time in a presentation if it's a problem? So from that point on, the same person interrupts every slide and derails the whole talk with irrelevant points. Instead of presenting what I worked so hard on, I end up feeling like I was under attack the entire time and don't even get to 1/3 of the presentation. Other panel members are usually silent and some ask couple of normal questions.

Second time it happened (today), I was presenting Kaggle type model fitting exercise. On my third slide, a panel member interrupts and asks me ""so how many of item x does out store sell per day on average?"" I said I don't know off the top of my head. He presses further: but how many? guess? I said ""Umm 15?"", He does ""that's not even close, see someone with retail data science experience would know that"". Again, it's on my CV that I don't have retail experience so why bother? The whole tone is snippy and hostile and it also takes over the presentation without me even getting to present technical work I did.

I was in tears after the interviews ended (I held it together during an interview). I come from a related field that never had this type of interview process. I am now hesitant to actually even apply to any more data science jobs. I don't know if I can spend 20-30 hours on a take home task again. It's absolutely draining.

Why do interviewers do that? Also, how to best respond? In another situation I would say ""hold your questions until the end of the presentation"". Here I also said that my preference is to answer questions after but the panel ignored it. I am not sure what to do. I feel like disconnecting from Zoom when it starts going that way as I already know I am not getting the offer.",376,278,Friendly-Cat-79,2021-03-30 10:36:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mgczg1/hostile_members_of_an_interview_panel_how_to/,0,datascience
kkbycj,[Meta] What exactly is this subreddit supposed to be for?,"The description states, ""A place for data science practitioners and professionals to discuss and debate data science career questions"" while rule number one reads ""Stay On Topic: A place for DS practitioners, amateur and professional, to discuss and debate topics relating to data science."" So which is it? A place to discuss data science career questions or a place to discuss topics relating to data science?

Additionally, on the [a meta post from six months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/hdmbkd/meta_state_of_the_subreddit_2020/), the moderators write

""We aren't trying to be a place for academic/technical discussions, since subreddits like [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/), [r/AskStatistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/), and [r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/) already cover those areas more specifically""

and

""We aren't trying to be a place for learning about, transitioning into, or getting a job in data science, since there are countless other blogs and websites discussing how to do that""

So, we can write about data science topics as long as the topic isn't technical and we can write about career questions as long as the question isn't about getting a job?

I understand this is your page and you have every right to decide what kind of content you want on it but it's frustrating to spend a long time writing a post or a comment only to have it be deleted. Would it be possible to clarify the rules by adding examples of the type of content you would like to see in addition to what you do not want to see?

tgd8ce,Resume/Application Advice & Comments for entry-level applicants,"Context: I just completed the process of hiring for a Jr. DS role. We had \~100 applications in one week. I personally read every resume because it's the first time I am working with this recruiter and needed to establish some alignment around what we're looking for. This isn't for a FAANG-type company - we're a sizable company, we're somewhere in tech, but we're not a creme de la creme-type company. 

First of all, some general observations:

* \~70% of applications were from people with an MS in DS
* \~70% of applications required H1B sponsorship
* The most common applicant profile was someone with a BS in something technical from a foreign school, who had then gotten an MS in DS from a somewhat reputable program in the US and would require H1B sponsorship.
* \~20% of applicants had some real world experience in data science
* The final slate of candidates were: 
   * Someone with a research-based MS degree in STEM from a very good US school where they had done ML work.
   * Someone with an MS in DS that already had experience in DS post-graduation
   * Someone with a BS and MS in math/quantitative finance/economics from a very good US school with several strong internships

Some general comments:

1. I see a lot of people (and I did when I was an entry-level applicant) who take the mindset of ""hey, I'm plenty smart for this role. I know I can learn what I need to learn to contribute, so why is no one giving me a chance?"". The answer has less to do with you and more to do with the fact that you're competing with 150 other people. And some of them have a fundamentally stronger background than you. So you need to change your mindset - when you get rejected, it's not because you're not good enough for the job. It's because there is just someone better.
2. If you do not need H1B sponsorship, make that clearly obvious in your resume. Especially if you have a foreign name (like me), degrees from a foreign university, etc. Don't give anyone any reason to asssume that you may need H1B sponsorship. Also - OPT doesn't count. Don't tell a recruiter that you don't need sponsorship to then tell them you're on OPT so you won't need sposorship for the next 3 years. That's just wasting everyone's time. Companies are either ok hiring F1 students or not. 
3. As an entry-level candidate, your focus should **not** be on portraying yourself as someone who knows everything - both on your resume and in person. That is, if you are an entry-level candidates, you cannot - almost by definition - be strong in every area of DS. Because of that, instead of trying to hype up every angle to look like a perfect candidate, in my experience you are better off picking your true strengths and doubling down on those - and being transparent as to where your weaknesses lie. For example - the most common one for fresh grads is not having real world experience working in a business environment. Don't try to convince me that your 3 month internship made you an expert in dealing with stakeholders. You're just wasting time. Instead, tell me ""yeah, I have limited experience in a real-world setting, but I'm really excited to jump into that environment and learn what I need to contribute"". 
4. You don't need an objective in your resume, *unless* you are making a career pivot or took an unconventional path to DS. If you got a MS in e.g. Sociology, but you did a lot of ML work in that progam, then you *have* to include that in an up-front statement. You can't wait for someone to get through your entire resume to figure that out. Why? Because you get 6-10 seconds to convince me that I should keep reading your resume. So if in those 10 seconds I did not see something that tells me ""yes, this story makes sense for a data scientist"", I am going to move on. Same if you're moving from a tangentially related role - you're going to want to explain up-front why I should believe that you can make that transition.
5. Stick to one page. If you're an entry-level candidate, there is no reason to have 2 pages. Again, it just makes it more likely that the person reading it will miss something you wanted them to see.
6. Along those lines - make the information that you think makes the best case for your candidacy easy to spot in your resume. To me, that breaks down into two options:
   1. If your education is strongest, put your education first, followed by your work experience.
   2. If your work experience is strong, put work experience first and put your education at the end (where it's easy to find). 
7. Do not shy away from listing non-DS or non-STEM experience. If you have limited work experience in DS, but spent 3 years working as a Manager at Applebees while in college? I want to know that. That tells me several things about you - firstly, that you worked during college. Secondly, that you have experience managing clients. Thirdly, that you have experience working in a chaotic environment. Short of telling me you have an onlyfans business, almost all experience is worth listing.
8. When listing team projects, please list what *you* worked on. Don't give me the broad description - focus on what you did.
9. Generaly speaking, there are two things that will make a hiring manager interested in you: experience, or potential. So, if I have candidate A who has solid experience doing what I need someone in this role to do, the way a different candidate B can have a chance without having that experience is to convince me that (obviously with some onboarding/training) they could be an even better candidate than A if given time. That will normally rely on candidate B having done really impressive things - whether it's in the classroom, research, internships, etc.

u17ot0,Remote work is going to be bad for us within 5 years or so,"Ever since the great resignation and the great switch to remote work, I've been bombarded by messages from recruiters on LinkedIn. Which seemed like a great thing, at first, but now that I've actually responded to some of them and seen how the job search is changing, I'm getting a little nervous about the future.

Interviews are *much* longer and *much* more demanding than they used to be. You meet with, like, 15 people, and if any single thing goes wrong -- one of them doesn't click with you, or your salary expectations are a bit higher than they expected, or whatever it might be -- they no longer just say: ""Well, he's the best we've got."" They wait, because they know that, somewhere in the world, the perfect candidate is out there.

That's frustrating -- but it's not what scares me.

What scares me is that my company and some of the other companies we are working with are starting to realize that the perfect candidate doesn't *have* to be in the USA.

We've started contracting out Dev and Data Engineering work to people in India, Croatia, and Bangladesh that will work and honestly do a great job for a fraction of the salaries we expect here.

I don't think companies have realized it yet, but I think they're starting to. Non-managerial, non-customer-facing technical roles can easily be outsourced to second and third-world countries, and, if they do, the tech sector is going to go through everything factory workers in the USA have already experienced.",373,233,takenorinvalid,2022-04-11 13:24:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/u17ot0/remote_work_is_going_to_be_bad_for_us_within_5/,0,datascience

1b8ym5o,I need to show how grateful I am to this sub,"Thanks you guys fpr every single book recommendation, for every single career advice.

I took your recommendations seriously, studied the books you told me to study, and studied other videos on my own, learning everything I can learn on my own.

Then I took the advice someone here told is to talk to someone internally in the data science team, turns out, they were impressed by the scope of the projects I worked on for a sales analyst and how I improved everything data-related in the department and the lead told me once I am ready (I still have a probability course to finish and recap hands on ML) and I will be up for a transfer.

I will be a junior DS in 5 or 6 months time after being an analyst for 2 years (I started when I was 20) and it's all you guys, so, thanks. 

Edit: here's everything:

I started when I was 18 years old, in something that I never knew it would be my gate to this job: a sales agent. Been so for a whole year. This gave me a lot of business context, how a manager leads people under him, and how his manager looks at his performance and understood something about the hierarchical behavior of companies. 
Then, I left the job after a year, now it's the pandemic, I spent it leqrning Excel and basic statistics, all on YouTube.

Moving forward to when I was 20, I had no idea a data analyst is even a title, and got a job as an accountant at a small workshop, with college going on, and I was studying business administration and statistics.
The job was never an accountant or have anything to do with accounting, my manager at the time was a very smart guy, working with pen and paper as his ledger, then I introduced Excel, he was all in for it, I started creating tables for our sales and inventory and customers and places we work in.

He started asking questions, you said last month we made 40K, how come we make 45 this month? I started digging into our data unknowingly doing analysis.

His brother was a regular visitor, I learned that he is the head of data at a big startup in our country, saw what I did, kept giving me tasks and I answer with Excel.

Then, he gave me a course that I highly recommend about Excel: power tools in Excel, you can find sources on YouTube for it a lot (power query, power pivot and data modeling). I started applying DAX, and here comes my first book [Dax Guide](https://www.google.com.eg/books/edition/_/dtr8oQEACAAJ?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiQo4eZ8OKEAxUXgP0HHXfgDTIQ7_IDKAB6BAgPEAM).

Then I started my LinkedIn journey, showing Excel and powerBI dashboards and applying to jobs, in data analysis, really that's all you need, business context, some technical tools to help you dig into the data and answer questions.

Then, I started reading about data science, how statistics is important and how much I liked it in college, here goes the second book, [Naked Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Statistics-Stripping-Dread-Data-ebook/dp/B007Q6XLF2).
Here I learned to think with stats a bit.

Then, I found that I lack implementation to a lot of concepts to statistics, people recommended python for me, here there were two sources for me to learn from, YouTube courses got me up and running into how to write simple code in python and understand the syntax.

Later, DataCamp had tracks, I finished the Data Analyst with python and another one data analyst with SQL. This helped me BIG time in knowing where to go next. 

Note: I was doing all of that while working and being in college.

The DataCamp course had great courses about statistics and probability and simulation. While also practicing SQL, I got really good with it.

Now, got a job as a junior sales ops analyst (my role now). I got lucky, working on real problems and practicing what I learn.

Then started moving back to books, but I lacked problem solving mindset, read these books: [Stop Guessing](https://www.amazon.com/Stop-Guessing-Behaviors-Problem-Solvers/dp/162656986X) and[Lean Analytics](https://leananalyticsbook.com/).

This helped me big time understand how my work affects the company. 

Now it's time to show your work to stakeholders, I read this book: [Storytelling with data](https://leananalyticsbook.com/).

It's time to go back to the details of my job, It was all querying on metabase, an open source BI tool.

I was responsible for giving agents retailers to visit, so, Every morning, we are supposed to apply filters on our data (last order date, last visit date and some other features ) and tell the agent, visit 20 of those retailers and go home. I was doing all of that in an automated fashion with power query, creating automated pipelines was my passion in Excel. All I had to do was give it an updated file from our database, refresh the pipeline, take the new file, dump it into our system.

They do visit 20 retailers, but the problem reached the tech team, the data was too much to handle, requiring us to give a smaller set of retailers for the agents, specifically 40 retailers.

But how do we guarantee they are close to each other? Here come my first interaction with adata scientist.

I did all what I did in Excel but in python using pandas and then reached the point where I don't know how to give clusters.

He took my jupyter notebook, gave it to us back with the solution to our problem, with something I was not familiar with at the time, Kmeans constrained.
Which took only longitude, latitude gave each agent his route of 40 retailers.

I started taking notes from his improvements to my code and asked him, what did you do?

He told my my code was fine, but you used a lot of custom functions on operations that can be vectorized, I asked for a book recommendation about vectorized operations in pandas here, the guys recommended this [Data Wrangling in python book](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Wrangling-Python-Tools-Easier/dp/1491948817).

After that book, I was obsessed with data automation in python using pandas and numpy only.

I got also obsessed with vectorizing any operation in our code base, read something pandas specific now: [Effective Pandas](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Pandas-Patterns-Manipulation-Treading/dp/B09MYXXSFM).

Then, it was the part where he interacted with our system API.

Since all our company data scientists and swes have access to snowflake and live databases, we, analysts, had access to only metabase.

I saw this as an opportunity to get known!

I wrote two functions used by our entire company, ret_metabase and interact_with_google_sheets
The first one connects to the API endpoint and then takes your credintials and the makes a session ID and gets your card ID string response in json and I convert it to a dataframe. The second requires an Api key, thenenables tge user to do anything with a google sheet, remove data set with a dataframe get data asa dataframe append on data filter views really anything in one function.
How did I learn to do all of that? A course on youtube , just type API development in python amd a book about data structures, [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Pandas-Patterns-Manipulation-Treading/dp/B09MYXXSFM). This helped big time in optimizing my code performance and writing cleaner code.

I got known and these functions are in the companies library now and people use it all the time. And I even left funny comments in the documentation and Everything.

The kmeans thing got me really interested in machine learning and here's the first book you guys recommended: [ISLR](https://www.statlearning.com/).

It was really hard for me at first because I had not been introduced properly to those three topics:
1- linear algebra
2- calculus
3- probability and statistics
I took [Jon Krohn's live lessions](https://github.com/jonkrohn/ML-foundations) it's free on YouTube.

But those three were later taken (started linear algebra in November 23).

So I struggled back then and here, another book was suggested: Hands-on ML.

I finished it and was really fucking hyped to apply the stuff I learned directly into my job, even without my manager permissions.

But that was not enough, I did not know what I should do to impact our compqny, what is data science?

I read this book: [Data science with business, what you need to know about DS](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Business-Data-Analytic-Thinking/dp/1449361323)

First thing I dod after understanding what kmeans is, improved our routes clustering function by standerdizing the scales of the long, lat, giving it another column ( retailer rank) that rankstarts at the maximum value the longitude and decays linearly from 31 to 30 (longitude here is from 30 to 31), I used linspace and select in numpy here to give retailers ranks. This rank was business objective (give 31 toretailers with high conversion and then 30.9 to retailers with monotonically decreasing nmv to make them order back and so on...) Any other retailer takes a zero in his face. This helped in giving optimized distance to retailers we really need to visit.

This gave us a big boost in agents strike rate and overall performance.

Second, I applied xgboost, predicting who will place an order today if visited. Gave them the biggest rank.

Testing this was a must, so I learned about A/B testing, and some other great bootstrapping ideas here [Practical Statistics](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781491952955/) Book.

This pushed our strike rate from 40 to 73%.

Then, I really now see that I lack probability knowledge and maths knowledge to be a data scientist, so I read [Essential maths for DS](https://www.amazon.eg/-/en/Essential-Math-Data-Science-Fundamental/dp/1098102932).

Since my job was about sales operations, it was a necessary thing to automate discovering new sales areas and opportunity, previously, we used to draw polygons in areas we want to open, and then the agents are set there to wander and find retailers on their own.

I got an idea, how about I get all streets know in this area and make blocks in the intersections and then convert the coords to google maps link and give 50 daily sequential links to agents to discover areas in a more naturally sequential way? I used omnix API to get streets data and geopandas to make all other operations, I learned how to work with geopandas from their docs, really straightforward.

This project was big, applied everything I know about pandas and data structures and business knowledge to do it, and it's up and running now.

I got praised for it and the head of data was impressed with the result and decided to give me access to snowflake directly to limit requests on metabase as the data was big and then I scaled the project to all regions we operate in.

Then it was time to speak with the senior ds lead.

I showed him all I wrote here, he recommended I get a strong foundation in linear algebra and calculus and probability.

I got it, and now working on probability and statistics.

I then told him I am really into causal inference (rwcommended by someone in my previous post here) and regression analysis.

He said that's exactly what they need from the junior they want to hire, ""anyone can fit and predict nowdays"" he said, ""we need someone who can make an impact in all the stuff we don't have time for and teach him more cloud tools and maybe he gives us new ideas or show us new tools"" he elaborated.

Right now I am studying probability and statistics and then will study [Causal Inference](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/causal-inference-in/9781098140243/).


I guess that's all, the most important thing is that you keep studying and never giving up, please, focus more on business context as it's overlooked.

I hope this was useful to you guys.",371,68,Careful_Engineer_700,2024-03-07 16:16:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1b8ym5o/i_need_to_show_how_grateful_i_am_to_this_sub/,0,datascience

13cpckb,PSA: You don't need fancy stuff to do good work.,"I've been reading a lot of posts on r/datascience and several seem to orbit the subject of how to use the latest tool or tweak, I understand that it can be easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of tools, frameworks, and cutting-edge technologies. While these advancements can undoubtedly enhance our work, it's important to remember that data science isn't about using the most advanced or expensive tools; it's about extracting valuable insights from data to drive informed decision-making.

Data Collection and Categorization

Before diving into advanced machine learning algorithms or statistical models, we need to start with the basics: collecting and organizing data. Fortunately, both Python and R offer a wealth of libraries that make it easy to collect data from a variety of sources, including web scraping, APIs, and reading from files. Key libraries in Python include [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [BeautifulSoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), while R has [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html), [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/), and [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/).

These libraries not only make it easy to collect data but also to clean and structure it for analysis. With just a few lines of code, you can filter, sort, and transform data into a format that's ready for exploration and modeling.

Data Analysis and Visualization

Once your data is collected and organized, the next step is to analyze and visualize it. Both Python and R excel in this area, providing a wide range of libraries and packages for exploratory data analysis and visualization.

Python's pandas, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) libraries offer powerful functionality for data manipulation, while [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [plotly](https://plotly.com/) provide versatile tools for creating visualizations. Similarly, in R, you can use dplyr, [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html) for data manipulation, and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [lattice](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html), and [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for visualization. These packages enable you to create insightful visualizations and perform statistical analyses without relying on expensive or proprietary software.

Modeling and Prediction

Finally, when it comes to building models and making predictions, Python and R have a plethora of options available. Libraries like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)in Python, or [caret](https://topepo.github.io/caret/), [randomForest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf), and [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)in R, provide powerful machine learning algorithms and statistical models that can be applied to a wide range of problems. What's more, these libraries are open-source and have extensive documentation and community support, making it easy to learn and apply new techniques without needing specialized training or expensive software licenses.

Simplicity is key, embrace it and you'll learn a lot faster than trying to glean insights from some poorly trained AI model.

leh0ve,"Data Science Masters - The Good, the Bad, The Ugly","TL;DR Edit, because I'm seeing a few comments taking this in a bit of a binary way...the program is valuable and interesting and I don't regret doing it per se, AND there are parts which are needlessly frustrating and unacceptable for a degree that's existed for this long from as ostensibly prestigious a university; don't completely scratch all your higher-ed plans, but please be an informed and prepared buyer of your own education. 

Hi all. I'm a FAANG data engineer, former analyst (yes: I escaped the Analyst Trap, if not in the direction I thought/hoped I was going to, yet) and current student in the UC Berkeley Masters of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program. I thought I'd do a little write up since I frequently see people asking about the pros and cons of these kind of programs. This is my personal experience (though definitely found other students share more than just a few of these experiences) so take with the customary salt grain.

The Good: The instructors are generally pretty good at explaining concepts, office hours are helpful, and projects are frequently relevant to what you \*might\* be doing on the job - or in a lab. The available courseload runs the gamut from serious statistics & causal inference (which you might...want to know if you ever plan on running an A/B test, much less a clinical trial) to machine learning *as implemented via distributed computing*/*in the cloud*, which is probably more realistic and practical in some cases than building yourself a whole model on your, I don't know, lenovo work laptop. There's an NLP course that gets good (if shell-shocked) reviews. Lots of decent people. Career services is actually quite helpful when they can be. Your student success advisor is almost certainly a damn saint; while they can't wave a magic wand to solve your problems, they will try to get you resources and advice you may need. Be nice to them.

The Bad: Berkeley...doesn't know how to run a smooth online data science class, evidently. The logistics are often messy. I've seen issues with git repos that arbitrarily prevented downloading necessary materials, major assumptions made on assignments about students prior experience (not like ""you've taken some math before"" - like ""you know how to do bash scripting,"" which is something that, more reasonably, a large % of people might genuinely have never really touched). Recordings of office hours that...don't show the screenshare, leaving you to *guess* at what's going on & follow along just by listening. Errors/typos in homework assignments as given. At one point we were running an experiment and promised up to $500 reimbursement - I paid OOP and then, as it turns out, reimbursement takes *into the next semester.* The instructor didn't even *know* when it would happen, or how, when I asked - so weeks, and weeks, of waiting to be reimbursed for a good half a k, with no good communication or clarity. Instructors are sometimes handed a class with built out materials & not prepared or provided any real familiarization with the materials as extant. In the course I am in now, there is someone dedicated to helping out w infrastructure...who has exactly 1 OH a week, which happens to be (mostly) *during an actual section,* with the aforementioned recording problem so heaven help you if you miss one and it's a time-sensitive issue that, for instance, is blocking your homework. I've seen at least 1 case where we were supposed to have 2wks to work on an assignment. Instructors forgot to upload the data needed for the HW until half a week after my section and didn't change the due date, meaning the weekend section(s) had the full two weeks, de facto, while we had less. I had to *ask* for the due date to be moved back, and even then *they didn't actually give our section the full time.* And dragged their feet making any decision about it at all. So...directly advantaging one or sections over others? Fun!

In general, the subject matter is fascinating and well-explained - when you get a chance to ask - and *most* of the classes I've taken have been fun, interesting, rewarding, and relevant - not always to my job right *now*, but certainly to \* some permutation\* of the broader data science role. It's definitely an intro - you're not gonna graduate from a 2yr degree as an objective expert in such a complex field - but it goes a hell of a lot deeper and touches on more relevant stuff than your average non-degree program would, I think. With that said, It can feel as if you're (expected to be) learning IT 202 on top of data science - which is a fine and important subject, but my attitude is it is 100% not what I paid for and not my job to be the unpaid Quality Assurance staff on the ""Online Masters"" Project, and this represents a profound failure of the school administration and, sadly, some of the instructors to treat their students fairly. It remains to be seen whether the whole masters is ""worth it"" - but I can honestly say that this semester and one of the others really are/were not, in my opinion, worth what I paid for them. At 8000+ dollars a class, *the school and/or the instructor better get it right.* And fix it if it's going wrong. So far, they...don't. My advisor is great, and highly sympathetic. But I haven't really seen any effort by the school administration or instructors to better the experience. As with most higher education, let the buyer beware: your experience will be more rewarding the more you expect and assume to be walking into a mess - but sadly, if you don't have enough time to start every assignment abominably early so you can ask every possible question / resolve any possible issue, make all the office hours you could possibly need to, and find the perfect group of study buddies, you're going to have some rough semesters.

&#x200B;

Not exactly dropping out of the degree, and I do feel it's ultimately valuable, but it's certainly dragging on a bit, and becoming more a game of ""how do I best compensate for the lack of communication, poor communication, and unacceptably disorganized infrastructure that I am almost certainly going to have to deal with"" than ""how do I learn this challenging and complex concept.""",367,212,TheBankTank,2021-02-07 06:21:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/leh0ve/data_science_masters_the_good_the_bad_the_ugly/,0,datascience

gh3v0q,Every Kaggle Competition Submission is a carbon copy of each other -- is Kaggle even relevant for non-beginners?,"When I was first learning Data Science a while back, I was mesmerized by Kaggle (the competition) as a polished platform for self-education. I was able to learn how to do complex visualizations, statistical correlations, and model tuning on a slew of different kinds of data.

But after working as a Data Scientist in industry for few years, I now find the platform to be shockingly basic, and every submission a carbon copy of one another. They all follow the same, unimaginative, and repetitive structure; first import the modules (and write a section on how you imported the modules), then do basic EDA (pd.scatter\_matrix...), next do even more basic statistical correlation (df.corr()...) and finally write few lines for training and tuning multiple algorithms. Copy and paste this format for every competition you enter, no matter the data or task at hand. It's basically what you do for every take homes.

The reason why this happens is because so much of the actual data science workflow is controlled and simplified. For instance, every target variable for a supervised learning competition is given to you. In real life scenarios, that's never the case. In fact, I find target variable creation to be extremely complex, since it's technically and conceptually difficult to define things like churn, upsell, conversion, new user, etc.

But is this just me? For experienced ML/DS practitioners in industry, do you find Kaggle remotely helpful? I wanted to get some inspiration for some ML project I wanted to do on customer retention for my company, and I was led completely dismayed by the lack of complexity and richness of thought in Kaggle submissions. The only thing I found helpful was doing some fancy visualization tricks through plotly. Is Kaggle just meant for beginners or am I using the platform wrong?",365,120,None,2020-05-10 15:50:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gh3v0q/every_kaggle_competition_submission_is_a_carbon/,0,datascience
po9qpo,Does anyone else feel Python is immensely more difficult than R?,"So I've been doing this for about 7 years now + a couple years of screwing around in grad school. At the same time, somehow I've just been able to stay primarily in R all these years. It's suboptimal, but I've never made an effort to transition to Python. I'm also bad in terms of best practices and staying on top of new developments. So that should be kept in mind.

Caveats out of the way... am I the only one who finds Python massively more difficult to use? I'm the only member of the DS team at my company at the moment and we just had someone leave who was primarily in Python. Some of his code broke and now I'm having to troubleshoot it. I can't make heads or tails. With my R code things are basically sequential and you can tell what's happening by searching object names and following changes to those objects. Whenever I look at my colleagues' python code it rarely resembles that. And it's cumbersome to run pieces of code and see where it's breaking. In R I can easily run this piece, then the next piece, then look inside constituent functions.

I've also never seen anything in my colleagues' code that resembles tidyverse. I'm ridiculously more efficient in data munging than I was in base R. Most of my data comes from the wild and cleaning data seems like a nightmare in Python. It could just be a skillset thing, but my when my Python colleagues would be responsible for cleaning data I would regularly find some troubling errors. I can't help but think it may have to do with the tool they're using.

My other gripe is environments. My old boss had some great projects, but the shit rarely runs for me. I spend a huge amount of time trying to set up the appropriate environments.

A more constructive question is how can I get my hands around this? Any time I sit down to learn Python I spend a lot of time on minor concepts that I would likely pick up anyway. After a few weeks I'm so bored that when other things come up I just drop it. The way I learned R involved adapting other people's code and understanding how it works. I'd pick apart something advanced and figure out simpler concepts as a part of that process. I have a ton of Python code available to me that's relevant to my job but I can't get it to run at all, much less truly understand it and build my own version.

xlvr0l,Who is applying to all these data scientist jobs?,"I see all these job postings on LinkedIn with 100+ applicants. I’m really skeptical that there are that many data science graduates out there. Is there really an avalanche of graduates out there, or are there a lot of under-qualified applicants? At a minimum, being a data scientist requires the following:

* Strong Python skills – but let’s face it, coding is hard, even with an idiot-proof language like Python. There’s also a difference between writing `import tree from sklearn` and actually knowing how to write maintainable, OOP code with unit tests, good use of design patterns etc.
* Statistics – tricky as hell.
* SQL – also not as easy as it looks.
* Very likely, other IT competencies, like version control, CI/CD, big data, security…

Is it realistic to expect that someone with a 3 month bootcamp can actually be a professional data scientist?

hbxj93,Forever a fraud ? Keep having horrific interviews and feel like I can never become a Data Scientist,"I have had some experience working as a machine learning engineer but if I am honest with myself, I barely did much. I am 24 with 2 years of experience. Got laid off, rightfully so.

I have been struggling with myself and I keep on preparing, studying... But the result is a loop of painful rejections. You know, the kind of rejections where the company was interested in you, set the bar reasonably not high and expected me to pass through it

&#x200B;

And yet I didn't. My profile looks good on paper but I feel like a fraud. Like someone who can try all he wants to but let's be honest, who is he kidding ? He doesn't know shit. He can't take up REAL responsibilities without having someone look over his shoulder. And even then he is lazy, mediocre.

Tried doing projects, watching videos, kaggle (that's a lie, I tried like 2 or 3 competitions that too I followed what others did)

I guess the gist of it is that I think I am a fraud. A phony. **I can have the bookish knowledge but I will forget it when I need it or would be unable to apply it.**

I'll never have what it takes to be an actual data scientist. It is just an unsophisticated fantasy.  And at the same I don't see myself doing anything else so I guess I am useless to the society\~ No one will hire me cause I can do nothing.

Just wanted to let it out after yet another disastrous interview which I knew everything about(as in, the answers to the questions), yet I messed it up. They threw a low ball and I missed my swing. Looked like a fool. & Now I am binging on the Office (TV show) to numb it up

j97s27,Thoughts on The Social Dilemma?,"There's a recently released Netflix documentary called ""The Social Dilemma"" that's been going somewhat viral and has made it's way into Netflix's list of trending videos.

The documentary is more or less an attack on social media platforms (mostly Facebook) and how they've steadily been contributing to tearing apart society for the better part of the last decade. There's interviews with a number of former top executives from Facebook, Twitter, Google, Pinterest (to name a few) and they explain how sites have used algorithms and AI to increase users' engagement, screen time, and addiction (and therefore profits), while leading to unintended negative consequences (the rise of confirmation bias, fake news, cyber bullying, etc). There's a lot of great information presented, none of which is that surprising for data scientists or those who have done even a little bit of research on social media.

In a way, it painted the practice of data science in a negative light, or at least how social media is unregulated (which I do agree it should be). But I know there's probably at least a few of you who have worked with social media data at one point or another, so I'd love to hear thoughts from those of you who have seen it.",356,139,umasstpt12,2020-10-11 15:52:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/j97s27/thoughts_on_the_social_dilemma/,0,datascience

tb2gi0,"Don't sweat the interview, come back stronger","I recently had my first interview with a serious Data Science position. I am a data analyst with lots of side work in machine learning, but not much in actual industry experience. Here are some of the interview questions/asks:

* Tell us about your work history.
* Give an example of the insights provided for (said) project.
* Name an example of a challenge you had and how did you solve it.
* Name an example of an accomplishment and how you achieved it.
* Any questions for us?

In answering these questions, I was not specific enough. I had results and I had experience that would make me good at this job. I am the lead researcher in my job, but I failed to communicate this to them. I was extremely bummed as this would be the first real 'data science' job I've had with a pay to back it up. But on the bright side, this has made me think about the interview process.

I agree with their decision, as hard as it is to admit. Why do I deserve a 6-figure salary if I can't give them clear, concise explanations as to how I benefit my current company?

 My takeaway is this:

1. Write out all your most influential experience, job projects, and personal projects
2. Follow a What, why, how approach. What did you do, why did you do it, and how did you do it.
3. Speak less, let them ask questions, and also, know that the ""soft"" questions are actually questions meant to derive a technical response.

I am surprised because, for almost any method below, a bachelor's degree in economics or statistics is sufficient. Maybe, we should include Gradient Boosting and Random Forest to the list, but they are not very challenging as well.

Hence, I become curious about what people's most proud contributions to their team or company.

Note: I am aware that using more complex techniques does not necessarily imply producing more fruitful results. However, the techniques mentioned above are still far away from people's expectations regarding being a data scientist. Thus, I am still curious about the most significant contributions, and how much people satisfied with them.

Edit: Mine was proposing a new solution to a highly complex classification problem. Proved that the proposed method has higher accuracy using bootstrap and t-test. Designed a production-level architecture to implement the new solution. Introduced the bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Accuracy rose from 70ish percent to 95+.

v4529a,Quick tip on asking the right questions during an interview,"I used to view asking questions during an interview as just a formality. 

I was completely wrong. 

Spending the time to ask great questions will:

1. Make you stand out because everyone else asks generic questions (if at all – some don’t ask any)
2. Tell you what you REALLY want to know about the company and role
3. Reveal what they’re looking for in their ideal candidate (which is info you can use in later rounds..)

So how do you ask the right questions? Just remember one thing:

Vague questions lead to vague answers. So make your questions s*pecific*. 

A simple way to do this is to ask questions about the past:

“How do you handle disagreements?” => “How did you handle a disagreement recently?”

“How do you balance using data vs intuition?” => “When did you last use intuition to make a decision?”

I made a table to help you frame your questions in a more effective manner:

|What I Want To Know|What I ask|
|:-|:-|
|What problems does the organization have?|What are the top 2 things you hope to improve in your org over the next 6 months?|
|What is working well in their opinion?|What are you really proud of?|
|What do they really expect from the advertised role? (i.e expectations)|What are the top two most impactful things I can achieve in the next 6-12 months?|
|Why do you want me (as a person) to join?|What from my resume or experience do you think is immediately valuable to the company?|
|Why did the last person leave?|What are the top two areas of improvement for the last person? What were their top strengths?|
|What's the work life balance like?|How often do you or another data scientist have to stay in late?|

What are your favorite questions to ask to your interviewer?

14a2u7h,Burned out after 3 days,"So I graduated University last month, and have had 3 different data scientist internships, and have just started a full time Data Scientist position at a scale-up company, where I am the second data scientist (the other data scientist is my manager) - and am 3 days into my job. 

I got hired with the company knowing I have zero experience with AWS, and I have no experience or domain knowledge industry of this industry (telecom industry). 

I’ve been tasked for my first project by the founder and the CTO of the company which is to understand how a ‘big and important’ client is losing so much money in Asia. And have been told numerous times how important the success of this project is for my company’s financial future and if the project isn’t successful we would lose this major client - and there is a strict deadline for 1 months time to complete this major project, which includes answering over 20 giant questions about the data, with many deliverables (it doesn’t help the quality of data is absolutely garbage). 

It’s only been 3 days and I feel so out of my depth. The founders and CTO are referring to this project as a ‘trial by fire’ and I am terrified. 

Sure the project is do-able, but I’m a fresh grad, junior data scientist and don’t feel like a project of this scale and importance should be given to a junior. Or maybe it should and I’m going crazy. 

My manager is great but has little time to support me. 

Not sure what to do or feel, but terrified and burnt out already by the thought of failing this project, losing the company tons of money and maybe getting fired as I’m on probation for the first 6 months of my job.

vmx1k2,"I turned down a job offer, the hiring manager wants to meet up. Why? Should I?","So I applied to this Junior Data Scientist position at a startup (not necessarily looking to change jobs, but always be applying, right?).

In light of this, I turned down the offer and everything seemed ok (I even saw they put up again the job posting). All of this happened through the recruiter, btw.

ngls7t,How to explain to Management that Data Cleaning is a really important part of my job,"Hi all,

I recently started my first job working as an entry level Data Scientist. I’ve been working at this company for roughly 3.5 months now and was put on a project where I am to extract phrases and classification codes from PDF documents in different languages (there is more to it than that - I’m just keeping it brief without disclosing too much).

I had relatively finished most of the algorithm that is able to extract and compile these phrases/codes - however, the dataset that I am using has all been entered manually by multiple different people who work at the company (~100+ people). This requires a lot of data cleaning to process duplicate phrases that are mapped to different codes, categories of codes, etc. Additionally, it appears that many people have formatted their inputs drastically differently. I am currently only doing this for the English language and then will have to do it for French, Spanish, and German in the coming weeks. Each dataset is initially 250,000 records where I can automate roughly 90% of the cleaning - the rest are all either really obscure cases or the classification of the duplicate phrases are too close to call causing me to have to closely examine and google them online to determine which one shouldn’t be there. 

I know all of this is all super vague - I am trying my best to explain what I can share (some things I can’t)

Back to my question - I have weekly meetings with management where some of them seem surprised when I tell them that I am still working on data cleaning (been working on it for 2 weeks now and will likely need more time than this as I haven’t even finished the English dataset). I would estimate that up to this point 70%-75% of the code I’ve written is for the sole purpose of data cleaning, preprocessing, and determining what belongs where (using fuzzy logic and embeddings). My question is how do I explain to them that the data cleaning process is most of the work a data scientist needs to do? Am I looking into this too much? Had I been given a perfectly clean dataset, I would be able to complete this in no time. Also, this is my first job out of college (bachelors degree in Data Science) and I definitely acknowledge the skill gap between me and the other members on my team who are Sr. Data Scientists. They are much more efficient than I am when it comes to things such as Deep Learning, the cloud, etc. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated



TL;DR My first job out of college. Been working at the company for 3.5 months as a data scientist. Management seems to be surprised that data cleaning is taking me so long (2 weeks and counting) to complete which makes me feel like I am not working efficiently enough. Does management have it backwards where they think building the ML models is more intense than the Data Cleaning portion?


Edit: Thank you all for the input and advice! I have a meeting with management later this week and I will definitely be using the suggestions and advice provided here

Edit 2: Wow!! I really can thank everyone enough for all the advice and feedback I received. You all have gave me some great guidance as to how I can navigate this issue. Thank you!

However, during my job search, I realized the research I do doesn't translate well to industry and there are no open positions in the roles that might align well. I took some supplementary courses (Coursera & Datacamp), set up a portfolio website, and widened my network. The tips and anecdotes shared in this subreddit were a crucial source of motivation and support.

bezjso,"Why arguing about who is a ""Real Data Scientist"" is a misguided exercise","One of the most common arguments these days revolves around what constitutes a ""real"" Data Scientist, and by proxy, who is deserving of the Data Scientist title. A popular opinion is that Data Scientists need to do machine learning or they're not real data scientists.

I think this completely misses the point of job titles: job titles are not meant to define a role. Job titles are meant to be corporate abbreviations for job descriptions. It is job descriptions that are matched against outside salary references, and it is job descriptions that are graded for pay purposes. Job descriptions are used for hiring purposes and ultimately job descriptions describe the job that you do.

There are some professions where titles have very real meanings (Lawyers who pass the bar exam, Professional Engineers who pass the P.E. exam, Accountants who are certified CPAs, etc.), but the majority of titles don't mean anything, and Data Scientist is certainly in that camp.

Other examples:

- At a lot of large corporation, you see Sr. Managers that don't manage anyone (i.e., have no direct reports).

- Every person in national/executive sales is a VP, even though they are not responsible for a P&L and often don't even have direct reports. Oh, and they make less money than a Director in every other branch of the company.

- Every bank title is incredibly inflated (again, TONS of VPs)

- Every quant/trading title is incredibly deflated - they'll seemingly call someone an analyst their whole lives even if they're making 400k and have 15 years experience.

The only constraints on job titles are often internal, and a consequence of how they fit relative to existing internal job descriptions. Specifically, if a specific job title term (e.g., Engineer, Analyst, Consultant) has traditionally been associated with a certain set of skills and responsibilities, a new role that has completely new requirements should in general avoid using the same title.

So why are so many companies giving Data Science titles to people who don't do Machine Learning given that the original data scientists had to? Here is what the life-cycle of creating a role looks like *at a company that doesn't have existing data science capabilities*:

1) Hiring manager decides she needs a new person with a profile that doesn't exist in the form of an existing job description. She needs this person to do mostly analysis, but she also needs them to be able to write code in Python to automate some processes, build the occasional model (likely not a production model), and access back-end databases directly and often. She may also, in time, need this person to dedicate more time to building more advanced statistical models, maybe even ML models, but as of right now that is highly uncertain because the company has never used ML in the past.

2) After writing this job description, the key hitting points look something like this: 

* Must have 2+ years experience with R/Python
* Must have 2+ years experience with SQL
* Must have experience building statistical models.
* A whole bunch of business and soft skills stuff

3) HR receives this job description and they now need to grade it. Since they have Analyst/Sr Analyst roles already, they compare the job description against those roles. They quickly find that none of those job descriptions require R/Python, SQL or building models. But they do match a lot of the other requirements, so it becomes clear that they will need a different type of role that is both different (includes Python/SQL/Modeling) and higher (more requirements) than the existing Analyst/Sr. Analyst roles. They may have even higher levels of Analyst (Lead, Principal), but none of them will require the use of Python/SQL/Modeling, so the fact of the matter is that they are going to need to get away from the Analyst title or otherwise create confusion and internal inconsistencies.

4) In order to do their benchmarking, HR pulls salaries and comp from an external data source that helps them match job description requirements to those posted by other companies. They work their way through putting the job description requirements into the system, and the system tells HR what jobs with similar JDs pay, including a range. It also tells this person the titles of the people who have similar JDs - which will likely include jobs that are legitimate Data Science jobs as they require R, Python, SQL, and statistical modeling experience. But it also will include some Analyst roles that do require programming skills (maybe some quant roles), and other random role titles that no one would think of looking into. All in all, the job grade that comes back is higher than an Analyst role (because of the added skills), but not quite as high as that of the first-gen Data Scientists, i.e., Ph.D. + 5 years experience in Silicon Valley. 

5) Now they need a job title. They know they can't name the role ""Analyst"" or ""Sr. Analyst"" because the skill set (and job grading) is different. Therefore they want to avoid having one ""Analyst"" making considerably more money than the rest of the Analysts, and also would like to make it clear that current Analysts may not have the skillset needed for this new role. They may, but it cannot be assumed by default that they do. They currently don't have any data scientists, so there's no toes to step on there, so it becomes a natural solution to name this new role ""Data Scientist"". Why that and not a completely new title to avoid clashing with the existing Data Scientist roles that are more senior in the marketplace?

* **You want a title that can be easily found by people with the right skillset**: because the candidate you are looking for has some characteristics of an old school data scientist and some of an analyst, you want to hit with a title that will catch the high-end of the pool you're looking for. ""Analyst"" may leave some of those people out. 

* **You want the role to be easy to find**: you can title the job ""Programming Friendly Analyst"", but it would just make it harder to get it to show up on searches. Meanwhile, because people are searching for the Data Scientist role often, it gives you better visibility. 

And there you have it, you now have a Data Scientist opening that you can post. Odds are you will get a wide range of candidates applying, including some who will be greatly overqualified (but will inquire because of the Data Science title being so variable), but you will end up hiring someone who is, ideally, at the top end of your requirements.

More importantly, as more and more companies do this, the general convergence is not based on original data science roles, but rather the new data science roles that are going to be more common because they will fill a need in a much larger market (i.e., more companies need people to tame their data and run basic modeling, fewer companies are ready for cutting edge ML).

You will certainly have organizations where step 5 is different, i.e., where the ""Analyst"" roles already have programming requirements (quants, consulting are all great examples), and in that case it makes sense that Data Scientist will be defined as ""can do ML"", because the only reason to create a new role will be to differentiate people who can do analysis, modeling, and programming from those who can do all of those things AND build machine learning models.

And then you have the even more extreme examples, FANGs, where you are seeing the creation of roles that are even more technical than Data Scientist (like Applied Scientist and Research Scientist and ML Engineer), which - again - were likely required to create internal differentiation between people who can execute machine learning models vs. people who can develop brand new machine learning concepts/scale machine learning to solve massively complex applications/etc.

On to my last point: to those who are on the cutting edge of machine learning and AI knowledge who feel ""icky"" getting lumped in with us simpletons who are just running fancy regression models to make our companies more money - just know that the reason your salaries are continuing to increase is because the number of companies hiring Data people like myself to solve simpleton problems is blowing up the market, and creating a scarcity everywhere in the field that is driving salaries up. So, while I understand that you like the prestige of having a title that reflects just how much more about machine learning you know that the rest of us, please appreciate that the popularity of the general field of Decision Science has greatly benefited you directly.

**TL;DR: No one company/group of people get to dictate what is/isn't a ""Data Scientist"". It is a natural response of the market to allow those companies looking for employees to find the right job seekers while satisfying internal corporate constraints. To continue to argue about who is/isn't a data scientist is pointless, because the title itself actually doesn't mean anything. Most importantly, a rising tide lifts all boats, and we have all benefited from the demand for all types of data scientists.**",342,75,dfphd,2019-04-19 14:11:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bezjso/why_arguing_about_who_is_a_real_data_scientist_is/,1,datascience

3m78k1,I hire data scientists - this is the stuff this forum doesn't discuss enough...:,"Hi,

I put a post up a week or so ago about how I hire some junior data scientists - I was actually struggling because I usually hire more senior positions. 
&nbsp;

I got some *great* feedback - and thank you to everyone who commented. At the time though, I put up a comment saying that I felt that this subreddit, and others like the ML one, while great at covering SOME of the area's in data science, left gaps in other area's that really matter in real world scenarios.  I said I would write something about it.
&nbsp;


I wrote an obscenely long post about it, and then it didn't post properly (operator error). So, rather than re-type that essay, I thought I would do something at a higher level and then answer questions.
&nbsp;


Lets set some context first.
I work in private industry - a big(ish) UK financial services company. I do a mix of internal R&D type work - stuff our own teams ask for - and stuff that clients ask for. So - everything that follows is in that context - it is a bit different if your working for a start up company. It is very different if your working in acedemia. It's very different if your working for government agencies. Keep that in mind.
&nbsp;


I think this forum is awesome - I lurk every day. However, there is stuff that makes up the majority of my life and my guys life that doesn't get discussed here which - as there are so many people posting about moving into this world, and looking for jobs in this world - I think is an issue.
&nbsp;


Here are some things which I think need to be discussed here more. Also - if you can show me this stuff on a CV or in an interview, it will jump you straight to the top of the pile. 
&nbsp;



**1) You are ridiculously expensive - show me how you will add value.**
There is a team in every private company that all other departments fear and dread. They are called ""Finance"" and they are the bane of every managers life. They apply basic mathematics in bizarre ways, and they will constantly demand that managers either spend more or less money than they are. The managers will NEVER win.
&nbsp;



When it comes to head count it boils down to profit margin. Lets say I am recruiting for a senior data scientist and will pay then $100,000 ( really - thats a bit on the low side, but it makes a simple calculation). Lets say my company runs at a 20% profit margin. In the world of Finance, this means that that person needs to add $500,000 of value- not $100,000 -  before they break even. You may think this is crazy - but that is because you are a mere mortal and do not know Finance Maths. You don't have to agree with it - you just have to live with it.
&nbsp;



What does that mean for you the data guy? You need to **Get Stuff Done**. You probably aren't going to be getting your own sales leads and doing your own deals - but you need to add value. And that really means ***BEING PRAGMATIC***
&nbsp;



Some work needs to be *absolutely* perfect. These are the places where you spend the extra week tweaking your model for that last .1% of accuracy. It's where you are expected to go read papers to find a new clustering algorithm that will reduce the over-fit by .5% and you get a month to try it and deal with it.
&nbsp;



But - a lot of stuff doesn't need perfection. If you need to join two sets of data as a one off task, then it doesn't matter if you use SAS, a lump of PERL, bookmarks in TextPad, Excel, Python. No one cares - you just need to get it done. If you need to know whether two elements of data correlate, then often a basic regression is ""good enough"", and will save you a couple of hours.
&nbsp;



*What does this mean?*
You'll know which hat you need to wear - but when you're wearing your ""just get it done"" hat - which will be more often than your ""Get it perfect"" hat - you need to a toolbag full of quick work arounds and practical methods. If something takes 100 lines of SAS, 10 lines of Python or 2 lines of Perl... don't go the SAS route. If you need to eyeball and juggle 10,000 records then you could drop it out as a set of tables with R, or you could do it in Excel. I know it's not cool - but finance don't care - so your manager doesn't - so you don't. Get good at this stuff. Be pragmatic. Know when to have a ""Good enough"" mentality. And show it.....
&nbsp;



**2) Learn to deal with junk**
Real world data is, usually, rubbish. You need to be *REALLY* good at dealing with rubbish.
Examples - I have about 2 petabytes of data coming from about 8,000 sources. The absolute best raw data set has a 2% error rate. The worst has a 75% error rate. Those figures are better than a lot of other groups are dealing with. You don't get to complain or get someone else to clean it up - you need to be good at adapting to it. REALLY REALLY REALLY good.
&nbsp;


That data comes in to me in perhaps 1500 schemas and formats. No provider - ever - sticks to a schema. EVER. *EVER!* So, I need to be able to join data that arrived in EBSDIC to stuff that turns up in weirdly compressed AVRO. (tip here - learn to love CSV - it's a perfect intermediate - as is an SQLite table). Looking across my data sets, I can see a minimum of 21 different data structures for Date:Time. What ever your going to do, your going to use dates and times. So - thats something you need to be slick with. Remember Point 1) - this is ""Get It Done"" stuff. 
&nbsp;


Also - a lot of data science is speculative - your going to have 10 idea's for every 1 actual piece of solid work you do. For those idea's, you're usually going to need to crash a data sample together, give it an eyeballing, patch it up a bit, do some basic work and see if it's practical. That means 9 out of 10 of those tasks you do will be disposable - so just Get It Done.
&nbsp;


All of this is probably best described as ""Data Monkeying"" - your not doing science - your monkeying with data. Realistically over the course of a year, you will probably spend 50% of your time doing Data Monkey work rather than real Data Science. 
&nbsp;


*What does that mean?*
When i recruit a data scientist, they absolutely, completely and totally MUST be damn good data monkeys. I'm counting on you being able to do the data monkeying in 50% of your day, not 90% of your day, so that the other 50% of your day you can do the ""Data Science"" bit and actually add value - cos the Finance Team are watching...
&nbsp;


It's not cool, you don't get a conference speech out of it, and it doesn't get you a bonus, but unless you are dealing with a single source of data, a good deal of your life is going to be spent dealing with this mess. You need to 1) get good at it and 2) not take too long dealing with it.
&nbsp;


If I had god like powers over this Sub I would make it so that 50% or more of the posts are people trading tips, cookbooks, idea's and lots of practice data sets so they are getting good at data monkeying, rather than Data Science. Definitely less cool - but will make the biggest impact to your working lives.
&nbsp;


Some examples of data monkeying: Flicking between data structures and schemas. Recasting data. parsing data. Changing time series - compressing and interpolation of time events -Spliting data. Joining data. Dealing with common types of tricky data - like names, address structures, dates, time series. blah blah blah.
&nbsp;


Fastest way to get your CV to the top of the pile - make sure that I can see your data monkeying as well as your data science skills.
&nbsp;


**3) Learn to tell a story and not be scary.**
Your going to work with all sorts of people - Sales, IT, Operations and lots of managers. And you will intimidate EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. Whether you are or not actually scary, when you walk into a room, they will automatically assume that you are the brightest person in that room and that your going to baffle them. 
&nbsp;


Some people - a minority - will try and get close to you and learn from you. The vast majority will react to their intimidation by either not listening to you at all ( many managers ) or feeling annoyed by you ( most sales people). It's not anyone's fault - it's just human nature. If you break out the big words, the jargon, the acronyms and present them with a 19 page excel spreadsheet you do nothing but reinforce those pre-conceptions. Downside for you is that it's harder to rapidly climb the career ladder. Downside for your boss is that it's harder for you to show 5x or 20x your salary as value - which means more discussions with Finance ( shudder)
&nbsp;



*Two easy fixes and one sneaky fix:*
**Fix 1** - Learn to tell a story. Seriously - when you tell people about your work give it a beginning, a middle and an end. ""I was asked X, I did A, B, C and D, it looks like the answer is Y"". You might not need to do this for people for people who read this sub, but this is humanising you. Another thing - put it in context ... I.e. ""A client has X as a problem... I did A, B, C and D. It looks like the answer is Y because it helps the client due to....blah blah blah..""
&nbsp;




**fix 2** - present in the right way for the audience.
Some people can deal with lots of data. Some people insist on it. Some people are intimiated by it. Some people genuinely see it as you trying to hide behind a snow of nonsense.  For example - if your doing something for a finance group, or a bunch of actuaries - you NEED the 19 page spreadsheet. And you'd better be damn sure every single cell is correct. If you were presenting to a senior sales manager, then you want a few pages of Powerpoint with big diagrams and a few bullets per page maximum. Thats not because the sales guy is less clever - it's just what they need to consume information. 
&nbsp;



You don't need to be a graphic designer - but you do need an acceptable grasp of displaying data. Reading FlowingData. Read blogs. Practice. Learn to make an acceptable spreadsheet. Learn to make an acceptable PowerPoint. Play with MathPlotLib/SAS-Graph/Plotly..... Again - you don't need to be amazing - you don't need to be a master data visualisation expert - ""good enough"" - but that still needs practice.
&nbsp;



**Sneaky fix:** Remember how you intimidate people because they think your a genius? Ask them a question about something they know - ""What do you think the client will do with this"" or ""How will HR use this data to plan the company party?"". Give them a set of options for something even if you make them up  Doesn't matter what it is - just ask one so they can contribute. Practice doing it subtly.
&nbsp;

y2f682,How to make the business love you (tips from an ex-corporate slave),"Hi all,

Since a lot of people would like to learn the softer side of data science (based on my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/xqmj9q/i_started_out_as_an_inhouse_data_scientist_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), I am back with another 10 tips.

&#x200B;

In most professional settings, it is not enough to be right.

You have to be **helpful**.

This means that you have to give more than just an answer.

You have to help your client understand where the answer is coming from.

*Note: A client can be a manager, colleague, or an actual paying client.*

## Here are 10 things that I learned:

### 1. The client wants someone that will take away their worries and absorb problems. 
Be that person.

### 2. Help the client understand why a recommendation makes sense. 
Give them reasons.

### 3. When presenting a recommendation, change statements into questions. 
“I would suggest X because of Y. Does this make sense to you?”

### 4. When talking to a client, rephrase his problem to make sure you both understand each-other. 
“So you think your customers are leaving because of bad customer service? Is that correct?”

### 5. Before you can help someone, you have to understand what’s on their mind. 
Ask a lot of questions, shut up and listen.

### 6. Don’t assume someone is a mind reader. 
Say what you think, but try to word it in a constructive way. Just saying that something is dumb is not helpful. Explain why the idea will not work, and come up with a new idea that you together can build upon.

### 7. Take notes during meetings and review them before the next meeting.
This will help in avoiding surprises.

### 8. If you like working with someone, say it. 
It builds the relationship which helps in collaboration. Do this only if you mean it though.

### 9. Almost everyone on every level in a serious profession feels imposter syndrome. 
Trust yourself; you know more than you think you do.

### 10. The key to solving problems is curiosity. 
Focus on what you don’t know, instead of what you know. Keep asking questions.

mspnso,Moving to a company where you are the only DS: growth opportunity or suicidal move?,"In my current DS job I am free to experiment with models and my boss lets me do some R&D. However, the production side is deficient: they use old tools, and very outdated pipelines and technologies. Most of the time we do ad hoc analyses for clients that require no production at all. I feel the need to grow my skills on production, and that's something I can't do where I am now.

That's why I'm looking for another job, even though I like my current company, boss and colleagues.

I was contacted for a new opportunity by a cool non-profit organization: they want to start a DS project that sounds very interesting to me (and useful for society IMHO), but there's one caveat: I'd be the first DS ever there. I would basically need to build everything from scratch, all by myself.

One one side, I could build a good career, I'd be plenty of room to do things my way. On the other side I'd be all alone, without anyone to learn with and from.

In career terms, would that be a suicidal move? Is there a risk to ""cut myself out"" the DS job market?

Have you every been the first DS in a company? Did you ever move from ""multi DS"" to ""single DS"" companies? And what have your learned from that?

m16lqf,Cultural debt is more dangerous than technical debt,"You can revert code, but you can’t revert culture.

Technical debt comes in when you choose a limited, easy solution and then have to rework it down the line. It’s the result of prioritizing speedy delivery over perfect code.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) systems, in particular, have a special ability to increase technical debt - because of hidden feedback loops, for example. 

There are consequences to this, but most teams accept the fact that *some* technical debt will always occur. And they’re okay with it because they know they’ll end up fixing whatever comprises they may have made.

Of course, you actually have to fix those issues. If you don’t, your debt will incur interest and you’ll pay for it 10x eventually.

Cultural debt is much more dangerous than technical debt. Once you hire the wrong people, it’s very hard to “fix”.

For example, you can’t just reverse a lack of diversity by hiring more people from underrepresented groups if 95% of your org is already just white males. New candidates won’t want to join and they’ll have no reason to - you’re going to have to start from scratch and think about what inclusion really means to you.

The same goes with setting your values. It’s a really vague word, right? Your “values” is normally just a bullshit term that companies put on their career pages - very few are actually intentional about defining the type of workplace they want to build.

By the time you’ve scaled, though, and you have hundreds of employees across different global offices, you’re going to have a hard time enabling the sort of principles that you want to see. You can’t just implement a culture of “open feedback” if for the past 2 years you’ve been doing no employee surveys or sharing employees’ anonymous feedback with everyone.

Cultural debt is especially dangerous when your managers don’t have an understanding of what type of organization you are trying to build. Managers have a multiplier effect on the organization - it’s a 1 to N dynamic.

And when you don’t invest in your management, that’s when you really see the consequences of weak culture. Your managers are going to be recruiting, managing, and leading. They will be the fundamental reason behind cultural debt spreading (or not spreading if you’ve properly invested in your people).

Most times, cultural debt occurs because people think that it’s at odds with actually getting shit done. They dismiss it as unimportant and what happens is that your people don’t get the time to grow and learn. After all, they’re too busy in their day to day.

If only solving these underlying issues were as simple as a git command. But it’s not because people are [complex](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/how-kevin-scott-motivates-engineers) and messy.

And the best thing you can do to minimize cultural debt is to be very intentional about the organization you want to build right from the start.

ls9c1r,"There is no perfect interview process, only trade-offs","Something that gets discussed here often are interviews - and specifically which is the ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to interview.

**There is no universally ""right"" way to interview, and I think that is super important for both hiring managers and candidates to understand.**

The reason? You are always making trade-offs:

* Shorter, more concise interview process introduce a higher risk of hiring the wrong candidate. Longer, more in-depth interview processes introduce a higher risk of false negatives (i.e., rejecting a candidate who would actually be great for the job), and a higher risk of just repelling qualified candidates.
* A focus on quizzes/tests/quick reaction questions introduces a high risk of giving good scores to people who either ""studied how to interview"" or just got lucky and knew the answers to those specific questions. Focusing instead only on their work experience introduces a high risk of hiring someone who can't think on their feet.

Having said that, in my experience there are a couple of universal ""truths"" in a statistical sense that really help with interviewing:

**People with a history of being productive are likely going to continue to be productive in the future. People with a history that lacks productivity are unlikely to become productive just for you.**

In my life, I've seen many candidates that looked great on paper. Had the right classes, knew the right things, talked the big game, etc. - but for some reason, when they actually got hired, would struggle to get things done. Everything would take too long, they would overthink things, didn't know when to ask for help, etc.

And that's when the red flag showed up retroactively: they knew all the right things, but had never produced. Whether in grad school (publications, projects, etc.) or work, the ratio of how much they knew and how much they did was off.

In my experience, this is mostly an inherent trait. Some people just find way to get things done, and some people just find ways to not get things done. And as far as I know, there is very little you can do as a manager to change that in a person.

What it has taught me is that someone that aces every part of the interview *but has nothing to show for in his previous places of employment* becomes a huge concern unless they have a great explanation as to why. And 99/100, there is no great reason why.

Message for hiring managers: focus on evidence of production in candidates.

Message for candidates: make your resume scream ""I get stuff done"". Achievements matter *way* more than things you know.

EDIT: Because a lot of people are asking ""how do I write down any achievements if I'm a student/have an NDA/etc.

Two things here:

1. You're going to be compared against a benchmark: someone fresh out of a MS is going to get graded on a completely different scale than someone with 2 years experience. So keep that in mind, and realize that you need to look productive relative to your peers.
2. You don't need to provide a ton of detail to show you were productive. Ideally you can say something like ""delivered $2M in revenue by implementing a blah model in blah"", but if you're not allowed to disclose those details you can just remove the quantities and keep it more vague. What *does* become critical is that you provide a cumulative list of projects/impact that looks good. If you're worked there for 2 years, you need to either have 1-2 *really* impressive accomplishments, or 4-6 more moderate/minor ones, but you need a combination of volume and impact that stands out.

Something that I think people often miss here: don't ""combine"" or ""aggregate"" projects. Don't say things like ""delivered $5M in value across several projects"". Nope, list every single project. Don't say things like ""collaborated on several cross-department initiatives"". Nope, list every single one and what you did in them - even if minor.

For example, compare these two lists:

* Delivered $2M in revenue as part of a multi-year, strategic plan to overhaul sales analytics process.

vs.

* Generated $200K in costs savings by optimizing ad spend across channels using a linear programming approach.
* Identified $300K in additional revenue opportunities through targeted price increases.
* Mitigated COGS increases of 2% by consolidating volume across multiple brands
* Helped leadership identify $50K in redundancies by providing ad-hoc analysis to identify redunancies.

What would you prefer to see? Hiring managers are almost surely going to prefer list #2, because it tells me you've generated value in a lot of different ways, a lot of different times. That means more samples that say ""I do things"".

If you're a fresh grad, what's critical is to make sure you cover every paper, report, document, project, etc., you've done. So avoid things like:

* Conducted cross-functional research in the area of blah

And instead break that down to what it actually meant:

* Performed literature review (over 30 manuscripts) in blah design, blah algorithms and blah optimization.
* Conducted weekly research meetings with researchers in the schools of Basket Weaving and Synchronized Swimming
* Prototyped novel model using combination of Python and smoke signals.
* Delivered monthly status updates to advisor

**Finding someone who knows how to do the things you need them to do right now is less important than finding someone who can learn the things you will need them to do now and in the future quickly**

The only constant in workplaces is change. A lot of hiring managers, when looking to hire someone, ask themselves ""what would this person do today?"", and then focus on finding people who are doing *exactly* those things today.

Now, if that pool is of candidates is big (e.g., you need them to code in Python), then that's a perfectly reasonble approach. But if that pool of candidates is small (e.g., you need people with experience in one specific algorithm), then you're going to get yourself in trouble because the odds of finding someone who is both an excellent applicant and has that exact experience is very, very small. Going to the previous point, you should be putting a lot more emphasis on finding productive people than finding people with the exact experience you want.

Why? Because experience can be acquired. People can learn. Not only that, what you may be having them do today may not be what they're doing in 6 months. Hell, maybe that person comes in and they themselves are able to suggest a new approach that works better than what you were doing before, rendering that skillset obsolete.

**A candidates' current skillset is largely dictates by their current job, and should not be taken as a fixed, static skillset**

I like sports analogies, so here goes one: Joe Thomas was an 11 year starter on the offensive line for the Cleveland Browns. A 10x pro bowler and 6x all pro, the guy is almost surely a first ballot hall of famer.

During his playing career, his weight was 325lbs. Here is a side-by-side of Joe Thomas during his playing days and now - after retirement.

https://preview.redd.it/go8lfyo47nj61.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=16914ad5a9fc3fbda99cc0a885337827e4ac4be4

Joe Thomas is currently 250 lbs. It took him less than 6 months to lose that weight. Why? Well, to play at 325, his diet looked something like this:

>Breakfast was usually a big bowl of oatmeal, a big thing of Greek yogurt with berries, granola, flax seed, honey, and then maybe 8-10 scrambled eggs and 4-5 pieces of bacon. Between breakfast and lunch, I’d have some type of snack, whether that was beef jerky, a protein shake, or a high-calorie smoothie. Lunch was a hamburger with all the fixings, plus french fries.  
>  
>Thomas went on to describe other aspects of his daily diet, including:  
>  
>A post-practice smoothie  
>  
>A tray of lasagna for dinner with a glass of whole milk  
>  
>A frozen pizza  
>  
>A sleeve of Girl Scout cookies and a bowl of ice cream right before bed

That is, to stay at 325, Joe Thomas had to *work.* And by work, I mean eat. A lot. All the time.

Ok, great story - what's the point of it?

When you look at candidates that have been in one environment for several years, hiring managers often look at their resume and assume that what they're doing now is just who they are. ""Oh, this person has been doing a bunch of ad-hoc analysis and BI reporting - not what I'm looking for, I need someone building models"".

And that is the wrong take, because for all we know, that candidates doing ad hoc analysis and BI reports is just Joe Thomas eating an entire frozen pizza before dinner. That is, it's a person that is doing what they need to do in order to do their current job well. Joe Thomas' job was to be huge and stop other huge people from hitting his QB. The guy doing ad hoc reports' job is to do ad hoc reports.

So what do you do with a candidate that has done mostly BI work but wants a position doing modeling? Two things:

1. You measure productivity. Their job was to do ad hoc reporting and building BI reports. How good were they at that? Did they differentiate themselves in that field? How many times did they go above and beyond what other people would have done in that role?
2. What experience do they have with modeling - not in this previous role, but ever? How well can they speak to that experience? And how excited are they to pick it back up?
3. What experience do they have learning something new? In doing ad hoc reporting and BI work, did they have to learn new technologies or languages?

Again, you can take the super risk averse stance and just not even entertain the thought of hiring someone without the exact experience you're looking for - but you are overwhelmingly likely to miss out on some great candidates.",333,81,dfphd,2021-02-25 15:40:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ls9c1r/there_is_no_perfect_interview_process_only/,0,datascience

cqw180,I learned more from studying for technical interviews than I did taking classes in college.,"My story might not be everyone’s or even the story of most people. 

But school gave me an overview of several topics. 

Data structures and algorithms class taught me the sorting algorithms, recursion, evolved recursion(dynamic programming), and the space-time trade off for various data structures...but I only had a few assignments to internalize the several concepts I was taught. 

Preparing for interviews and learning how to code these concepts taught me so much more. For one, I had to implement all of these from scratch and I practiced them much more than once or twice(unlike in school). I was also exposed to many more algorithms thanks to geeksforgeeks and the interview questions I had. 

My initial data science class taught me how to query from api’s, create visualizations, some linear/logistic regression and use Hadoop for a bigram word counts. 

But studying for interviews taught me these same concepts in much more depth and gave me much more muscle memory. 

Same with sql- my school never had a proper class on sql- we had one group project for a client where we dabbled in sql a little

It was only after practicing sqlzoo and hackerrank that I actually even truly understood sql. 

I look back and ask why. It’s simple- I learn better when answering quiz like questions on several topics over and over again and writing code for the same algorithms several times. School doesn’t give you that opportunity to fail your way to understanding the material.

12bseqo,Data Science in HR - People Analytics,"# Preface

Some time ago a redditor posted on this sub asking for advice regarding a people analytics data science role. I’ve been in the field for 5 years now as a data scientist so I commented that I’d be happy to have a chat. A lot of people actually DMd me asking for more info so I figured I’d make a post about it.

# What is People Analytics (PA)

HR departments usually have dedicated groups focusing on Compensation, Benefits, Talent Acquisition, Diversity and Inclusion and so on.

All those departments usually have a lot of data but do very little with it analytically. A lot of the work done is more of a reporting nature, and if any analytics is done it’s usually very basic or uses a third party consulting firm for benchmarking and what not.

The idea of people analytics is simply doing actual analytics on this data. It does no necessarily mean data science and machine learning though. In most cases, the org simply does not have enough headcount to do that. Thanks fully I’ve worked mostly with large orgs and have had the opportunity to do a lot of machine learning work there given that they have sufficient data.

But regardless of whether ML is involved or not, it is about doing valuable analytics to generate insights about your workforce. I’ve listed some example projects further down in this post.

# Pros & Cons

## Pros:

This field allows you to generate actual business value and work with very interesting data. Everything regarding the workforce can be linked back to a monetary value of some sort. For example, Turnover can be linked to the cost of recruitment and hiring, so by providing ways to reduce turnover, you provide ways to reduce cost to the organization. So you can become very valuable to your organization.

Additionally, it is also growing very fast. HR is archaic and really lacks behind in terms of analytics. Companies are realizing this and trying to act on it. I get a lot of recruiters reach out to me on LinkedIn for a DS position on a new PA team.

## Cons:

The data science ceiling is low, mostly because of the data. I have worked with large organizations with 50,000+ employees. So in those cases I can run a variety of models because my sample size is good. But most companies are not that big. You will struggle to build meaningful models when your company only has 1000-5000 employees mainly because most analyses will be focus on a subset of that full population, further reducing your sample size.

So this is not a field where you'll have a ton of opportunity to work a lot with deep learning, or anything more advanced than GLMs or boosted models. Your audience is also highly likely not technical, so the methodology you use has to be easily explainable.

Another big issue is the fact that a lot of people-data-based ML models will have poor performance. This is mostly because you try to model something behavioral, without the necessary data. For example, predicting turnover - whether someone leaves an org or not is very rarely captured by just their pay and job characteristics. There are a lot of behavioral and qualitative factors that are just not available in your data.

So your model is sub optimal, but the business still expects answers. So you have to be able to understand how to work with such models, and how to best manage expectations and derive feasible outcomes.

# ML Project Examples

## Pay Equity

The first very common project is pay equity - are employees being discriminated against on the basis of gender, age or race? This is usually just a multiple regression problem where you attempt to build a model that replicates the organizations pay philosophy and attempt to predict pay for every employee. You can then add in variables like gender and race and determine if there is a discrepancy and if it is statically significant. These types of projects are heavily legally regulated so you have very little to no flexibility in your approach.

These types of projects also shed light on whether the organizations pay philosophy is observed in practice and can pinpoint employees who are underpaid or overpaid relative to expectations. Overall it generates a lot of very good insights for the organization that isn’t just pay equity. and of course, part of the analysis is providing a strategic budget adjustment to remediate any pay inequity across the company.

Pay equity projects are very common now given recent legislature changes in the U.S. and is the cash cow of many consulting firms.

## Turnover Modeling

Using HR data such as job and personal characteristics, compensation, survey data and so on to predict the likelihood of an employee leaving the organization.

This can also shed some light onto what factors can drive turnover and help identify turnover hotspots in the organization. These analyses are rarely accurate at an individual level, but aggregated at a higher level can be pretty powerful.

The biggest impact from these analyses come from using those drivers and creating some scenario modeling to identify cost saving opportunities.

## Job Architecture

A job architecture is the structure that identifies the various levels and distinction between each job. This is typically a combination of “grade” or “level” at your organization and job family.

Usually this is done in a very qualitative and extremely tedious way. But we have recently come up with an NLP driven approach in which we identify a similarity score based on each job title and business characteristics associated with each title. We then apply a clustering methodology to create groups of similar jobs. Further analyses can be applied to these groups.

## Other Root Cause Analyses

I’ve worked on a slew of other projects that were very similar in nature. They would revolve around predicting one thing for employees (I.e., performance, engagement, overtime hours) and using the drivers to generate insights regarding that metric as well as cost saving opportunities.

## Salesman Evaluation

This can be applied to a variety of roles but I’ve seen it used predominantly on sales roles given their direct business impact.

Essentially we attempt to predict in a given quarter/timeframe someone’s sales performance. What differs from the root causes projects I’ve mentioned above is that we usually work with some research team to design a very specific survey.

The questions to those surveys are designed to help us gain a much more comprehensive understanding of what behavioral factor matters the most for sales roles and we’ve applied these insights to the hiring and developmental processes of these sales roles.

# Concluding Thoughts

So I hope this is helpful for anyone interested in doing analytics in HR. Personally I think its a great field to start in, but not necessarily to make a career out of. I'm personally looking to transition away from it now.

It provided me with a lot of opportunities to do meaningful and impactful data science, but ultimately the DS ceiling is limited.",331,37,scun1995,2023-04-04 18:46:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/12bseqo/data_science_in_hr_people_analytics/,0,datascience

14khdp2,Data Science is a fad (Cynical Post #2334),"I wanted to contribute yet another post which is more on the cynical side regarding data science as an industry. I know that many people lurking here are trying to draw up pros and cons lists for going into the industry. This is a contribution to the cons column.

My current gripe with DS is that I have lost faith that the industry will ever be able to absorb data-driven decision making as a culture. For a long time, I thought that it's more about improving my communication skills, creating explainers on how the models work, or just waiting for the world to 'catch-up' to data science. These techniques were new and complex, after all - it would take some time for the industry to adjust, as a Gartner article might tell you. But those businesses which did adjust would do better over time, and the market would force others to compete.

This line of thinking completely falls apart once you go into the history of 'quantitative methods' in business decision making. DS is really just the latest in a long line of attempts at doing this stuff including:

* Quantitative Methods
* Operations Research
* Management Science (Rebranded Operations Research)
* Business Intelligence
* Data Mining
* Business Analytics

All these fields are still around, of course. But they tend to occupy a particular niche, and their claims to radically transform the business world are gone. They aren't the 'sexiest job of the 21 century"". People have been trying to do this whole ""Business, but with Models!"" thing for *years*. But it never really caught on. Why?

DS is just hype, and the hype cycle for DS will implode and not recover. Or it will recover to the same level that these other techniques did.

Data Science isn't better than any of those other disciplines. Here is my response to some objections:

* **Maybe they weren't adding real business value?** Crack open the average Operations Research / Management Science textbook and I guarantee you you'll find problems which are more business-focused than anything you'll find on Towards Data Science or a DS textbook. They developed remarkable models to deal with inventory problems, demand estimation, resource planning, scheduling problems, forecasting and insights gathering - and most of their models were even prescriptive and automated using Optimization solvers.
* **But they weren't putting their models in production right?** Yes, but the concept of doing a regression on a huge business data base, or even using a decision tree, is decades old now. It used to be called ""Knowledge Discovery in Databases"" and later ""Data Mining"". The ISLR of data mining, Witten's *Data Mining*, was first published in 2003. That's 20 years ago. They were using Java to do everything we do today, and at a reasonable scale (especially considering that with many of these problems, an extra GB of data doesn't get you much).
* **But they weren't doing predictive modelling.** TBH predictive modelling is one of the least impressive sub-branches of modelling, I have no idea why it's so hyped. Much more interesting and relevant models - optimization modelling, risk analysis, forecasting, clustering - have all fallen out of popularity. Why do you think predictive modelling is the secret bullet? Besides, they did have some predictive modelling - 'data mining' used to include it as a part of the study, together with other 'modern' techniques like anomaly detection, association rules/market basket analysis.
* **But what about \[insert specific application here\]**. Most of the things that people pitch as being 'things we can now do with data science' are decades old. For example, customer segmentation models using 'data science' to help you better understand customers... You can find marketing analytics textbooks from the late 90s that show you exactly how to do that. And they'll include a hell of a lot more domain knowledge than most data science articles today, which seem to think that the domain knowledge just needs an introductory paragraph to grok and then we get to the Python.
* **Maybe it just takes time?** Wayne Winston's *Operations Research* was published in 1987 and included material that could help you basically automate a significant amount of your business decision making with a PC. That was 36 years ago.
* **But what about big data?** The law of large numbers and the central limit theorem still apply. At a certain point, the extra gigabyte of data isn't really helping, and neither is the extra column in the database.
* **Data Science is much more complex and advanced, true data science requires a PhD**. An actual graduate level course in Operations Research requires you to integrate advanced linear algebra, computational algorithms and PhD level statistics to develop automated solutions that scale. People with these skills have been building enormous models for the airline industry for a few decades now, but were barely recognized for it. DS isn't that much more complex, so what justifies the large salaries and hype when com. sci + math + stats at scale has been around for a while now?

The marginal improvement in the performance of a subset of statistical techniques (predictive modelling, forecasting) doesn't justify the sudden exuberance about DS and 'data'.

As best I can tell, here is what is truly new in 'data science':

* ML means we can turn unstructured data like videos and images and text into structured data: e.g. easily estimating the amount of damage by a flood for an insurer using satellite images.
* People in Silicon Valley can have human-out-the-loop decision making, which they need for their apps and recommenders. This use case is truly new and didn't exist in the 90s.

I think that this kind of 'operational data science' makes sense: using truly new types of data from video to images, and having computers which we can trust to label the data and apply further logic to it. That's new.

But the kind of data science where you think that you submitting a report or visualisation to your boss and then he'll take it into consideration when he makes decisions - that's been around for ages. It's never become the kind of revolutionary, widespread force in business that DS keeps promising it will be. In ten years, ""data scientist"" will be like Operations Researcher - a very niche and special thing off in the corner somewhere which most people don't know about outside of a particular industry.

The only people who managed to really turn maths into money were the Actuarial Scientists and the Quants (Financial Engineers).

My take now is basically this:

* If you work in the actual niche where data science has something new to offer - processing unstructured data for use in live apps like Tinder - then yes, continue. That's great. That's the equivalent of doing Operations Research and going into logistics.
* If you are trying to apply those same techniques to general business decision making, then you are going to end up like a ""Management Scientist"" or, for that matter, a ""BI Analyst"" in a few years - they were once the cutting edge just like DS is now. They amounted to very little. There's really no difference. Predictive modelling is not so much more amazing than optimization or association rules, which nobody talks about much anymore.
* If you just want to make a lot of money doing maths - go for Actuarial Science or Financial Engineering/Quants. Those guys figured it out and then created a walled garden of credentials to protect their salaries. Just join them. (Although I hear Act Sci is more about regulations in practise than maths, but still).

tl;dr - DS is just the latest in a long string of equally 'revolutionary' and impressive attempts at introducing scientific decision making into business. It will become as marginalised as all of them in the future, outside of the Silicon Valley niche. Your boss, your company and your industry will never adopt a true data-driven culture - they've had almost 40 years to do it by now and they're still suspicious of regression beyond the 'line of best fit'. It's not happening fam.",327,192,Top_Lime1820,2023-06-27 15:52:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14khdp2/data_science_is_a_fad_cynical_post_2334/,0,datascience
kxgqbp,Are my interview questions unreasonable? Or are my candidates just bad?,"I do technical interviews for data scientists at a mid-sized firm in the finance/insurance sector. I have seen plenty of resumes, all of them look stellar and hits all of the key buzzwords. But during interviews, I often get the sense that there's a lack of genuine understanding of the concepts beyond the surface level talking points. For example, many candidates get tripped up by one of more of these:

1. If I have a categorical feature, we can encoding it with a single column of numbers (label-encoding) or with multiple 1/0 columns (one-hot-encoding)? Why might we *not* want to label-encode? ([Reference](https://towardsdatascience.com/categorical-encoding-using-label-encoding-and-one-hot-encoder-911ef77fb5bd))
2. If they've used XGBoost on the job before - Why might the default feature-importance plot in XGBoost - counting the number of times a variable was used to make a split - be misleading? What are some other options you have? ([Reference](https://towardsdatascience.com/be-careful-when-interpreting-your-features-importance-in-xgboost-6e16132588e7))
3. If we're talking about classification models - Why do we use logloss as the objective function for binary classification models? What does it penalize? Why is it ""different"" than just maximizing accuracy? ([Reference](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/180116/when-is-log-loss-metric-appropriate-for-evaluating-performance-of-a-classifier))
4. Assume we're presenting our model results to management. How can we show/visualize the improvement of one model over another, beyond just comparing their RMSE or accuracy? ([One possible answer](https://www.listendata.com/2014/08/excel-template-gain-and-lift-charts.html))

Keep in mind that these are just some illustrative examples - the actual questions would depend on the context of the interview and their background. Also, this is for an *experienced* position, not an entry level one. I ask these questions because I think if you've truly built ML models before and understood them, then you should be able to answer these no problem. Candidates who can't answer these have a higher chance of falling for common pitfalls or mistakes, either for model building or for interpreting results.

I have had candidates be able to answer all of them easily and concisely. But most of the time, I get either a wrong answer or some long-winded non-answer. In fact I just interviewed a candidate whose resume was stacked but couldn't answer any (and even other easier ones). So this got me wondering, are questions like these unreasonable? Or is it just normal to have to filter out 8 out of 10 candidates it seems? If anyone here does interviews, do you have a similar experience?

Edit: Getting a lot of mixed responses. I want to address some of the concerns people shared:

1. **Too much domain-specific terminology:** This was my bad. I used what I thought was the ""most common"" terms in my OP, since of course I can't list all possible names for a concept in a reddit post. In practice though, we've never had a problem with terminology since we wouldn't be asking for those - all such questions would come in the context of the discussion at the time.
2. **Not everyone has used XGBoost or whatever before:** None of these questions would be brought up in a vacuum. In practice, we're asking these questions based on past background, projects, or mini-case studies that we give during the interview. So if a candidate has only worked on NNs before, we wouldn't be asking about XGB.
3. **Give them behavioral questions instead:** We do, but i'm specifically in charge of the technical interview.
4. **Give them a computer with live data and ask them to code:** Sure, but I think this could be pretty nerve wracking for the candidate, especially since no one I know codes without stack overflow open somewhere.",329,240,Admiral_Wen,2021-01-14 22:41:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/kxgqbp/are_my_interview_questions_unreasonable_or_are_my/,0,datascience

cjbr09,Preview video of bamboolib - a UI for pandas. Stop googling pandas commands,"Hi,

a couple of friends and I are currently thinking if we should create bamboolib.

Please check out the **short product vision video** and let us know what you think:

[**https://youtu.be/yM-j5bY6cHw**](https://youtu.be/yM-j5bY6cHw)

&#x200B;

The main benefits of bamboolib will be:

* you can **manipulate your pandas df via a user interface** within your Jupyter Notebook
* you get **immediate feedback** on all your data transformations
* you can **stop googling for pandas commands**
* you can **export the Python pandas code** of your manipulations

&#x200B;

What is your opinion about the library? Should we create this?

la5jw3,"Fellow unemployed Data Scientists in the job market, what's been your story?","2 YOE Data Scientist from the Bay Area here. I've been in the job market for 3 harrowing months, going on multiple final interviews with no success. It's been crippling, and I'd love to hear what your journey and experience has been like. Partly, it'd be good to share our mutual pain but also to understand who we are competing against.

Starting with myself, I found the interview process to not be all that difficult, but the competition to be (supposedly) extreme. It seems like you have to more than perfect on your SQL/pandas questions, and if there is an SOB who can solve the problem faster and with less temp tables than you, you won't get the job just because of that single hair difference. And even if you did the best, maybe someone has a Ph.D while you only have a masters and you don't have a Fang on your resume, only a medium sized start up.

I was told during one of my final interviews in a growing company that i was one of 7 other candidates (how is that a final interview then??). And according to a career specialist I knew from my bootcamp a while back it seems like job market in feb will be more intense than dec of last year, for a variety of reasons.

I'd love to hear what your experience has been like, what you think is keeping you from getting the offer, and any strategies we can share to get ahead of the 7 other candidates in the final interview who basically look like us in very similar way.

**EDIT:** Thanks everyone for the supportive reply. Great suggestions from the thread:

1. Look at unexplored spaces like government jobs, non-Bay area jobs (although these companies are the only ones reaching back to me. My experience has shown that location is an important variable for companies even though on linkedin they celebrate wfh policies on the surface).
2. People with 3.5+ YOE are also struggling to even get final interviews.
3. The Data Science bubble might have finally burst, and companies are realizing that we aren't as valuable as Data/ML Engineers or don't know how to use us properly (story of my life in my last company).

n04ga6,Physics PhD transitioning to data science: any advices?,"Hello,

I will soon get my PhD in Physics. Being a little underwhelmed by academia and physics I am thinking about making the transition to data-related fields (which seem really awesome and is also the only hiring market for scientists where I live).

My main issue is that my CV is hard to sell to the data world. I've got a paper on ML, been doing data analysis for almost all my PhD, and got decent analytics in Python etc. But I can't say my skills are at production level. The market also seems to have evolved rapidly: jobs qualifications are extremely tight, requiring advanced database management, data piping etc.

During my entire education I've been sold the idea that everybody hires physicists because they can learn anything pretty fast. Companies were supposed to hire and train us apparently. From what I understand now, this might not be the case as companies now have plethora of proper computer scientists at their disposal.

I still have \~1 year of funding left after my graduation, which I intend to ""use"" to search for a job and acquire the skills needed to enter the field. I was wondering if anyone had done this transition in the recent years ? What are the main things I should consider learning first ? From what I understand, git version control, SQL/noSQL are a must, is there anything else that comes to your mind ? How about ""soft"" skills ? How did you fit in with actual data engineers and analysts ?

6q1y7b,Some advice for young and aspiring Data Scientists,"I've decided to make this small post to help people navigate this big world of data science, feel free to ask any follow up questions, and please do not PM me, any questions you have, ask them here, for everyone to see.

My background: I did a Phd and Masters in Data Science/ML, ML summer school, ML researcher at UCLA and Data Scientist at NASA. Currently do Data Science as a consulting gig, with a company.

**Architectures**

- Learn how to use Hadoop/Spark. But for the love of God, don't spend 3 months configuring your own Hadoop cluster. Is fun (I've done it), but is just not worth it. Familiarize yourself with plug and play systems like ElasticMapReduce (Amazon), HDInsight (Microsoft Azure), Cloudera or Hortonworks. They have all the tools you might need afterwards (NIFI, Storm, etc). 

- Learn how to setup and administer at least one SQL database and a non-SQL type. In a good company you will have a data engineer that will do that for you, but is always nice to know what the hell is happening.

- Don't try to understand and be fluent in every single tool available, learn the tools when you need to use them. I can't tell you how much time I've lost learning tools that I never used.

**Languages**

- DS is not art, you do not need beautiful languages like Haskell or be fluent in Design Patterns. DS is ugly hacking most of the time.

- As a followup learn Python or R, both are languages where hacking is rather easy and straightforward and have plenty of ways to interact with popular Big Data paradigms.

**Background**

- Learn math, really, you won't become a Data Scientist just because you know SQL and a bit of Python. Many times, the problem needs a not so obvious tool, and just using a demo algorithm from sklearn won't solve the problem.

- Before using an algorithm, be sure which function it is optimizing. You wouldn't use linear regression for classification, right? Why? Because both have different objective functions, and are optimizing different stuff.

- Really, really, don't just plug and play algorithms. We are not there yet.

- Start with simple models, and if they don't work move to more complex things. Data Science is not research, we are not competing to have the best accuracy, many times, the client doesn't give a shit about accuracy, just that their problem is solved. Honestly, unless you are Google or Facebook, your problems can be probably solved without using DeepLearning.

- On that note, don't jump steps. Don't start trying to do DeepLearning if you don't know other algorithms like SVMs or Logistic Regression. You would be amazed how many clients tell me they want to use Deep Learning and have like 500Kb of data.",328,75,leonoel,2017-07-28 06:09:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6q1y7b/some_advice_for_young_and_aspiring_data_scientists/,0,datascience

191zdny,Pre screening assessments are getting insane,"I am a data scientist in industry. I applied for a job of data scientist. 

I heard back regarding an assessment which is a word document from an executive assistant. The task is to automate anaysis for bullet masking cartilages. They ask to build an algorithm and share the package to them.

No data was provided, just 1 image as an example with little  explanation . They expect a full on model/solution to be developed in 2 weeks. 

Since when is this bullshit real, how is a data scientist expected to get the bullet cartilages of a 9mm handgun with processing and build an algorithm and deploy it in a package in the span of two weeks for a Job PRE-SCREENING.

Never in my life saw any pre screening this tough. This is a flat out project to do on the job.


Edit: i saw a lot of the comments from the people in the community. Thank you so much for sharing your stories. I am glad that I am not the only one that feels this way. 

Update: the company expects candidates to find google images for them mind it, do the forensic analysis and then train a model for them. Everything is to be handed to them as a package. Its even more grunt work where people basically collect data for them and build models. 

Update2: the hiring manager responds with saying this is a very basic straightforward task. Thats what the job does on a daily basis and is one of the easiest things a data scientist can do. Despite the overwhelming complexity and how tedious it is to manually do the thing.

rztoqy,Advice on Anxiety Issues as a Coder and a Data Analyst,"I am a data analyst with less than a year of experience. Ever since I started working, I realized that my anxiety is very easily triggered and it is causing me issues professionally and in my own learning journey. 

For example, even while solving minor issues, I tend to get tunnel vision, preventing me from analyzing all available info, which leads to me asking for help from teammates unnecessarily. This happens much more when working on new environments or tools.

When I self-study, I find myself filled with nervous energy with my brain jumping around causing me a whole lot of panic and not a lot of learning. 

It also pops up when I am trying to quickly process information or when I am put under the spotlight. Once panic gets triggered, I lose focus and make ditzy errors. 

I have had these problems since forever but never really thought much about them, I just thought I was dumb or something. But I feel I am not dumb, these traits are limiting me. Especially now when I am trying to give my 100% throughout the day.

Following things have helped a bit, but I still have a long way to go,

1. Taking a mental break. When I start to panic and tunnel vision, thinking about some random thread for a while and coming back helps a lot. Even if only momentary.
2. Writing. I find describing the error, and the coding I have up to that point, in writing, usually helps center myself a bit.  
3. Mindfulness. Taking a moment to myself when I start to feel like I am losing it.

qqynka,Am I the only one that absolutely hates SQL?,"Every job interview I've ever participated in has asked (increasingly complex) SQL questions for doing some statistical analysis on a dataset, yet once on the job I hardly ever use it for anything other than basic data extraction and loading.

I feel like the original design intent of SQL was for it to be very human readable and standardized. But as soon as you move away from even the most basic ETL tasks it becomes a nightmare to try and read and follow, let alone debug. The syntax become incredibly tortured, e.g. when having to nest subqueries and so on (which becomes necessary almost immediately). Further, the slightly different dialects of SQL can lead to some tasks being absolutely trivial in one but painful in another.

I understand it's historical usage, and the need to be familiar with it. But with modern compute tools and resources, I don't see the utility in doing your hardcore analysis completely in SQL. Further, I understand that some people have to work with truly huge datasets and are severely constrained in what tools they can use. But I think that the vast majority of data scientists are working with datasets that, for any given particular question, can be handled by something like python.

Am I alone here? I have almost always been able to compose a query that simply extracts the raw data I need and loads it into python where statistical analysis, processing, visualization, etc. are trivial in comparison. I feel like if you're doing anything other than basic selects, joins, and groupbys, you should be using a different tool.

This is partly a rant because I'm currently sitting in a training session where we are being shown how to train ML models in BigQuery and it seems absolutely ridiculous to me. It seems fine for perfectly manicured datasets, but this seems like such a far cry from what SQL was designed to be that I feel like we're strapping rocket engines on a horse.",321,193,ZhuangZhe,2021-11-10 16:50:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/qqynka/am_i_the_only_one_that_absolutely_hates_sql/,0,datascience

ej5yux,I Self Published a Book on “Data Science in Production”,"Hi Reddit,

Over the past 6 months I've been working on a technical book focused on helping aspiring data scientists to get hands-on experience with cloud computing environments using the Python ecosystem. The book is targeted at readers already familiar with libraries such as Pandas and scikit-learn that are looking to build out a portfolio of applied projects.

To author the book, I used the Leanpub platform to provide drafts of the text as I completed each chapter. To typeset the book, I used the R bookdown package by Yihui Xie to translate my markdown into a PDF format. I also used Google docs to edit drafts and check for typos. One of the reasons that I wanted to self publish the book was to explore the different marketing platforms available for promoting texts and to get hands on with some of the user acquisition tools that are commonly used in the mobile gaming industry.

a5v1ba,Data science questions I never knew to ask until I started working (and still dont know the answers to),"Here are some questions I have that I never knew to ask until I started working as a DS. I don't have the answers to these questions, because I haven't had to deal with them yet, but I can see that they are on the horizon for me:

-How to work with cloud computing/ aws instances:
For example, if I needed to work with lots of data that I can't handle on my local machine, how do I set up a cloud instance to get this going, and is the experience the same as working on a local machine?

-How to get machine learning models built in Python into a production ready product:
For instance, the most common way I see folks doing this is by using the flask library with docker. I've actually never had to do this yet, but it's something on the horizon and there are very few step by step guides out there.

-How to set up a BI environment:
Bored analysts are often relegated to managing the data in some sort of BI platform. What are the best practices here, and what tools are you using? What's the easiest BI platform to use with Python so that I can limit the amount of scripting and transformations done in the BI tool.

-Best practices for documenting data lineage:
For example, when working with a BI platform such as Qlik, Tableu, etc, what are the best practices for documenting data transformations conducted in these tools for any kind of root error tracking in analysis? 

-Best practices for building a proof-of-concept:
For example, if I want to build some sort of deep learning algorithm that can do some crazy shit, what's the best way to build a proof of concept to get buy in from the rest of the team?

I think it would be cool if we could start generating a list of questions, or topics, there aren't given the attention they deserve on common learning platforms such as data camp, dataquest, udemy, Coursera, etc, which all seem to focus primarily on building models and underlying math concepts, but don't really answer some of the challenges you face in a business setting.",323,103,neuroguy6,2018-12-13 16:30:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/a5v1ba/data_science_questions_i_never_knew_to_ask_until/,0,datascience
s548as,Any Other Hiring Managers/Leaders Out There Petrified About The Future Of DS?,"I've been interviewing/hiring DS for about 6-7 years, and I'm honestly very concerned about what I've been seeing over the past ~18 months. Wanted to get others pulse on the situation. 

The past 2 weeks have been my push to secure our summer interns. We're planning on bringing in 3 for the team, a mix of BS and MS candidates. So far I've interviewed over 30 candidates, and it honestly has me concerned. For interns we focus mostly on behavioral based interview questions - truthfully I don't think its fair to really drill someone on technical questions when they're still learning and looking for a developmental role. 

That being said, I do as a handful (2-4) of rather simple 'technical' questions. One of which, being:

*Explain the difference between linear and logistic regression.*

I'm not expecting much, maybe a mention of continuous/binary response would suffice... Of the 30+ people I have interviewed over the past weeks, 3 have been able to formulate a remotely passable response (2 MS, 1 BS candidate). 

Now these aren't bad candidates, they're coming from well known state schools, reputable private institutions, and even a couple of Ivy's scattered in there. They are bright, do well at the behavioral questions, good previous work experience, etc.. and the majority of these resumes also mention things like machine/deep learning, tensorflow, specific algorithms, and related projects they've done. 

**The most concerning however is the number of people applying for DS/Sr. DS that struggle with the exact same question.** We use one of the big name tech recruiters to funnel us full-time candidates, many of them have held roles as a DS for some extended period of time. The Linear/Logistic regression question is something I use in a meet and greet 1st round interview (we go much deeper in later rounds). I would say we're batting 50% of candidates being able to field it. 

So I want to know:

1) Is this a trend that others responsible for hiring are noticing, if so, has it got noticeably worse over the past ~12m? 

2) If so, where does the blame lie? Is it with the academic institutions? The general perception of DS? Somewhere else?

3) Do I have unrealistic expectations? 

4) Do you think the influx underqualified individuals is giving/will give data science a bad rep?",324,337,ticktocktoe,2022-01-16 05:10:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/s548as/any_other_hiring_managersleaders_out_there/,0,datascience

l76fr9,Ghosted after 3 interviews and a long assessment,"Yep, you heard right, I applied as a Data Analyst Intern at a Startup and I was given a long and pretty hard Assessment to test my knowledge, nonetheless, I nailed it (Even the technical chief congratulated me on it), well.. after that I had an interview with the recruiter, 15 min, short and easy, the second one was 45 minutes long, again, I was asked technical questions which I nailed.

And then the COO interview, it was the weirdest of them all, a guy asking about my hobbies and uninteresting stuff about my life for about 45 minutes, I gave my best effort regardless.

The last interview was on 12/14, after that, nothing. not even a ""Sorry you didn't get selected"" or something like that, I even sent 3 emails, split between 3 weeks and didn't have any answer for my recruiter, so yeah I'm pretty sure I've been ghosted.

I know, ""if they treat you like this when you're not even working there, you dodged a bullet"", but It's hard af to find a job position and this was almost like heaven sent.

Does this happen often? I can't find a job anywhere in data science, should I just look for something else? I even got offered a position as a java developer after being rejected as a data science full time.

Is it a good idea to just work something else to gain experience? because regardless of what you know, if you don't have experience recruiters just don't look at you.",321,158,killanight,2021-01-28 19:40:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/l76fr9/ghosted_after_3_interviews_and_a_long_assessment/,0,datascience

mazvd0,realize I don't want to be hardcore stats guy,"I like statistics and the theory behind a lot of the models implemented in data science but I don't think I can be learning this stuff for the rest of my career. I feel like the more I learn the more I realize how much more there is.

Right now it's the linear algebra foundation of PCA,  I can obviously do the matrix multiplication but I don't understand how it reaches the result and feels like magic to me. But I have so many subjects to go through, not looking forward to data structures and how computers work. I feel like I can keep doing this for 4 more years or so but I'm worried it's never going to end due to the field evolving.

So many posts on this topic and all seem to have an underlying premise that data cleaning sucks and that the modeling is what's interesting/fun. But the cleaning takes up so much time precisely because it's very challenging, ambiguous. It's the part of the process I think will be last to be automated (if it ever is). I get that modeling can provide deep insights and/or value and so are certainly rewarding, but I *really* think many of our conversations on this topic miss the point.

eleuz9,About IBMs Data Science Certification,"Yesterday, there was a top post on this sub on 30day trial IBM gives for its [data science courses, specializations and certs](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). I looked at it, saw 4.6 and 4.7 star averages and courses with interesting titles and syllabus so I decided to take it and try to power finish it, since I already have some experience.

So I finished first two courses and boy oh boy - what a disaster. It is well expected for this kind of cert to force you use ecosystem of the provider being that google, amazon, IBM or whoever. However, you would expect it to be a WORKING environment. Everything is so outdated in the course notes, software looks nothing like in instructions, some of it even got completely revamped. There are issues with account creation, 503 server response everywhere, loading times in scale of minutes and so on.

At first I thought it was me, my system or location issues, but then you open forums and see hundreds or thousands of complaints that reach back to beginning of 2019 or end of 2018 even. There are band-aid fixes that are sometimes provided, but something that worked 8 months ago doesn't work now since something changed again. All in all a terrible experience.

All of this is just technical problems that made me tell others about this. What I will leave here without much in-depth analysis is the actual quizes and assignments, which I would call at least questionable in the sense how much someone can learn from. Sometimes it feels like it is testing your ability to use IBMs way of doing things, not the actual underlying technology.

Although I saw all this in their second course, I investigated other courses in specialization since i thought this was kind of a non essential topic (using notebooks and other resources). They all follow similar pattern with lot of people feeling disappointed and wanting their money back. From that I decided to bail from it, and felt the need to share this. All of this is easily verifiable by going to said courses, and selecting reviews - then most helpful. Who knows how these courses got such high grade average. Maybe they were good enough at the time they were made.

qxugtt,My IT department at work wants to ban Anaconda and replace it with ???,"I use Anaconda as a package manager because it installs easily and comes with a lot of packages that I use frequently, like numpy/pandas/matplotlib. Lately getting more into ML packages.

IT apparently just realized that Anaconda lets users install packages without admin rights. I don't think they really understand how Anaconda works, to be honest-- they said they plan to replace Anaconda with Spyder, which, um, is not a package manager. 

There are probably ~20 users around the company who I've helped set up with Anaconda so we can all use the same code.

I think their plan is to locally host packages we want after they've vetted them as safe. Is this a thing at all? What sort of tools would you recommend to do this?

From my perspective it seems better to just opt for the paid tier of Anaconda, which has a verification service for packages in their repo.

lngmug,Is it still worth self-learning Data Science and is it okay to abandon it?,"I've been self-learning Data Science, but browsing this subreddit, it would appear the field is a bit overhyped and very oversaturated - with millions of juniors graduating in data science trying to break into the industry.

I currently work full-time in an unrelated role, but I'm at the age now where I just want to land myself a programming job where I can earn decent enough money. I'm worried I'll spend the next couple of years self-learning Data Science, only to spend another 2 years or more trying to get a job.

I should note I have various interests. I do enjoy stats, programming, data, and so on. So I find enjoyment in anything that relates to these - although I'm probably a better programmer than a statistician. I'm okay at Maths, but I do have to relearn everything starting from Algebra, and I'm always doubtful as to whether or not I could ever apply a machine learning algorithm to a business problem. I'm also aware, even with the time I've already spent learning Data Science, it would probably take me a lot less time to start earning money in web development.

I'm just wondering if the right thing for me right now would be to switch to something like web development. I enjoyed learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Or perhaps find a Python developer position. I don't really know. Ideally I would just learn everything and see what happens but obviously that's not an option.

Whatever I choose, the idea of giving up on something I've dedicated 100s of hours to only to start from scratch in another field is causing me all kinds of mental anguish, especially at the age of 29.

zcizwb,Does anyone else find Python clunky for simple data science?,"So after years of using Stata I have decided, in recent months to switch to Python, for obvious reasons. Although I am an economist, I feel comfortable coding, since I have been using Javascript as a hobbyist for >10 years, and I instantly fell in love with Python's simplicity.

And yet, when attempting to use Python to do my job, i.e. mainly run a bunch of regressions with different model specifications, I find myself missing Stata terribly. It just feels so much easier to make tweaks to models and run them over and over again with Stata, as is so often needed on a day-to-day basis.

Just to be clear, I have tried really hard to switch and I enjoy exploring ML models in Python. Yet when it comes to simple everyday tasks, I still can't resist Stata's seductive call.

Has anyone else had a similar experience with Python or is it just a matter of moving along the learning curve?

q4stma,To all those asking: “can I get a job with X skill with Y degree”,"1. It depends on the job position: If it explicitly states “skill X”, then it’s probably best to know it. 

2. Companies make mistakes too, and might not know why they’re hiring you. 

3. If you’re focused purely on your skills instead of marketing yourself, you’re shooting yourself in the foot: communicate getting shit done clearly and concisely, you will get more hits. 

4. If you have a master, especially MSc, you’re golden. Bachelor works too (I’m speaking for Germany here, master is the norm.)

I think a place I could improve is how my projects are structured, where my input and output data is stored, readability, things like that. I thought maybe to get the book Reafactoring by Fowler, does anyone have any opinions on that?

Is there any other good resources people can recommend? I'm also generally interested in other thing I can do to improve my code. What are things you think people could generally improve upon?

ryzzbr,Does anyone else get imposter syndrome about their role vs the 1% of data science?,"Been thinking about this after a couple of chats in this subreddit this week. I’m a senior/lead DS and I would say 70% of my job is pretty much analytics with a spin. Wrangling data that pure SQL analysts can’t get, maybe performing hypothesis testing if it’s sampled. Once a quarter there’s a “big” ML project, but even that is usually used for insight/internal monitoring &amp; reporting. 

I think i got into DS to build ML led software that changes experiences for millions of people. After doing several interviews recently, I’ve kinda realised barely anyone is doing that. Hence, why calling it the 1%. Obviously, selection bias here with who I’m interviewing with, but I tried to select across the spectrum of startup to big tech to Fortune 500 corporate. 

On paper, I’m probably in the 1%: truly “big data”, big tech, cloud infra, read academic papers on NNs to keep up to date, do get to play with ML. However I don’t feel like I’m in whatever people decided was the “sexiest job of the 21st century”. Where the imposter syndrome kicks in is like… have I just interpreted the job wrong. Am I doing the job wrong now and at my previous places? Is everyone else out there building Le Cun style things from scratch and deploying to millions &amp; it’s just me?

I love it, don’t get me wrong, but I feel like most people are doing analytics with flavour. What do you all reckon? Am I interviewing in the wrong places? Am I talking rubbish?

**My background** \-

I am based out of India and I started my career as an SAP Consultant. 5 years into it, I pivoted to Data science, joined a consulting start-up and now finally moved to data scientist role after trying for a year and half. I know it's quite hard to get into the field right now, so I am willing to help out anyone who wanna talk.

I am reachable on Discord (*jaegarbong*) and DMs.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**:

Thanks for the love guys. I am trying to reply as fast as I can to the DMs. But since I found a few FAQs,  I will list them out here.

1. I got my job in India and not in USA/Europe.
2. I have not done any masters.
3. There are lots of moving parts to getting a job. Since I do not know what you are doing wrong or right, I can't provide any new tips/tricks that you probably haven't seen reels/videos/articles of.
4. Scoring an interview has a different skillset from cracking the interview. The former is mostly non-technical, the latter being extremely technical.
5. If you have anything specific area I can assist with, I am more than happy to help if I can.
6. Again, I must request you to not ask me for guidance without being specific - I do not know what you are doing wrong or right, so me repeating the same advice won't work. For e.g. a specific question might be  - ""*Is DSA necessary to learn*?"" Then no, I have neither studied DSA nor have been asked in any of my 30+ interviews I have given. However, it's not a thumb rule that you might not be asked.

Please understand that I am not being rude here, but rather trying to not repeat the same vanilla tips/tricks/guidance that you probably have not come across already.",305,91,jaegarbong,2024-02-08 16:24:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1alzjgv/i_made_it/,0,datascience
17avmi5,Where are all the entry level jobs? Which MS program should I go for? Some tips from a hiring manager at an F50,"The bulk of this subreddit is filled with people trying to break into data science, completing certifications and getting MS degrees from diploma mills but with no real guidance. Oftentimes the advice I see here is from people without DS jobs trying to help other people without DS jobs on projects etc. It's more or less blind leading the blind.

Here's an insider perspective from me. I'm a hiring manager at an F50 financial services company you've probably heard of, I've been working for \~4 years and I'll share how entry-level roles actually get hired into.

There's a few different pathways. I've listed them in order of where the bulk of our candidate pool and current hires comes from

1. We pick MS students from very specific programs that we trust. These programs have been around for a while, we have a relationship with the school and have a good idea of the curriculum. Georgia Tech, Columbia, UVa, UC Berkeley, UW Seattle, NCSU are some universities we hire from. We don't come back every year to hire, just the years that we need positions filled. Sometimes you'll look around at teams here and 40% of them went to the same program. They're stellar hires. The programs that we hire from are incredibly competitive to get into, are not diploma mills, and most importantly, their programs have been around longer than the DS hype. How does the hiring process work? We just reach out to the career counselor at the school, they put out an interest list for students who want to work for us, we flip through the resumes and pick the students we like to interview. It's very streamlined both for us as an employer and for the student. Although I didn't come from this path (I was a referred by a friend during the hiring boom and just have a PhD), I'm actively involved in the hiring efforts.
2. We host hackathons every year for students to participate in. The winners of these hackathons typically get brought back to interview for internship positions, and if they perform well we pick them up as full time hires.
3. Generic career fairs at universities. If you go a to a university, you've probably seen career fairs with companies that come to recruit.
4. Referrals from our current employees. Typically they refer a candidate to us, we interview them, and if we like them, we'll punt them over to the recruiter to get the process started for hiring them. Typically the hiring manager has seen the resume before the recruiter has because the resume came straight to their inbox from one of their colleagues
5. Internal mobility of someone who shows promise but just needs an opportunity. We've already worked with them in some capacity, know them to be bright, and are willing to give them a shot even if they don't have the skills.
6. Far and away the worst and hardest way to get a job, our recruiter sends us their resume after screening candidates who applied online through the job portal. Our recruiters know more or less what to look for (I'm thankful ours are not trash)

This is true not just for our company but a lot of large companies broadly. I know Home Depot, Microsoft and few other large retail companies some of my network works at hire candidates this way.

Is it fair to the general population? No. But as employees at a company we have limited resources to put into finding quality candidates and we typically use pathways that we know work, and work well in generating high quality hires.

EDIT: Some actionable advice for those who are feeling disheartened. I'll add just a couple of points here:

1. If you already have your MS in this field or a related one and are looking for a job, reach out to your network. Go to the career fairs at your university and see if you can get some data-adjacent job in finance, marketing, operations or sales where you might be working with data scientists. Then you can try to transition internally into the roles that might be interesting to you.
2. There are also non-profit data organizations like Data Kind and others. They have working data scientists already volunteering time there, you can get involved, get some real world experience with non-profit data sets and leverage that to set yourself apart. It's a fantastic way to get some experience AND build your professional network.
3. Work on an open-source library and making it better. You'll learn some best practices. If you make it through the online hiring screen, this will really set you apart from other candidates
4. If you are pre MS and just figuring out where you want to go, research the program's career outcomes before picking a school. No school can guarantee you a job, but many have strong alumni and industry networks that make finding a job way easier. Do not go just because it looks like it's easy to get into. If it's easy to get into, it means that they're a new program who came in with the hype train

EDIT 2: I think some people are getting the wrong idea about ""prestige"" where the companies I'm aware of only hire from Ivies or public universities that are as strong as Ivies. That's not always the case - some schools have deliberately cultivated relationships with employers to generate a talent pipeline for their students. They're not always a top 10 school, but programs with very strong industry connections.

For example, Penn State is an example of a school with very strong industry ties to companies in NJ, PA and NY for engineering students. These students can go to job fairs or sign up for company interest lists for their degree program at their schools, talk directly to working alumni and recruiters and get their resume in front of a hiring manager that way. It's about the relationship that the university has cultivated to the local industries that hire and their ability to generate candidates that can feed that talent pipeline.",306,149,Consistent-Design-57,2023-10-18 17:00:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17avmi5/where_are_all_the_entry_level_jobs_which_ms/,0,datascience

I'm curious what everyone's DS stack looks like. What are the tools you use to:

* Process: Python for prototyping, then I usually end up doing a bunch of this with Airflow executing each step
* Query: R Studio, PopSQL, Python+pandas - basically I'm trying to get into a dataframe as fast as possible
* Visualize: ggplot2
* Share: I don't have a great answer here; exports + dropbox or s3
* Love: Jupyter/iPython notebooks (but they're super hard to move into production)

wajjgn,My Guide To Building A Strong Data Science Portfolio,"Having a strong portfolio is like bringing a bazooka to a knife fight.

When you *show* hiring managers what you can do instead of telling them, your lack of experience doesn’t really matter anymore.

The fact that you couldn’t solve their algorithm question in record time isn’t critical. And the fact that you didn’t go to Harvard isn’t a problem.

You have something better. You have proof that you can do the work.

I spent over 40 hours researching what makes a phenomenal portfolio.

First, though, let’s address some misconceptions about portfolios.

## Misconceptions

**Misconception #1: Recruiters don’t have time to look at your portfolio**

One of the biggest arguments against having a portfolio is that no one will look at it because recruiters have to forge through hundreds of applicants.

The portfolio is not for the recruiter. It’s for the hiring manager. And by the time you get to the hiring manager, he 100% has the time to look at your portfolio because it’s no longer 100 resumes (it’s like 10-15).

**Misconception #2: Personal Website == Portfolio**

Whilst it’s true that most portfolios are hosted on your personal website, they can be anywhere. A Github repo, a notion site, a mega article on Medium – as long the work you’ve done is on the internet and you are able to link to it, you have a portfolio.

You don’t need to spend hours on designing the “perfect” personal website. You technically don’t even need one.

**Misconception #3: Portfolio is a “nice to have” and not something that can land me a job.**

There’s plenty of people that have landed great jobs without a strong portfolio. But I think that the benefits of a strong portfolio extend way beyond just landing the “job”.

By working on projects you find interesting and sharing them with the world, you:

* Attract potential employers to you (instead of always just going through a regular interview process)
* Attract potential cofounders for future ventures
* Get more data on the type of work you find interesting

The above benefits extend into the long term and can be career defining.

**Misconception #4: Only technical folks have a portfolio**

In tech, the concept of a portfolio is generally tied to the following roles:

* Software Engineering
* Data Science
* UX / Design

But I think that you can build a strong portfolio for *any* type of role. This includes non-technical roles like product and marketing.

This is because the best portfolio projects share a few themes.

And those themes can impress *any* hiring manager, no matter the field.

## Anatomy of a strong portfolio project

The perfect portfolio project is:

1. Fun
2. Technically (or domain) relevant
3. Explainable

A strong portfolio project only really needs to fulfill two of the above criteria.

Let’s walk through each one.

**Fun**

Most of your competition will just build clones of popular apps like Facebook or Reddit.

They’ll find the most popular Kaggle dataset and download the CSV file. Or they’ll write a case study on Web3 just because it’s in vogue.

We’re going to take a different approach. We’re going to work on a project that you find fun.

When you build something that you find fun, it means that you’re leveraging some domain knowledge you have or a competitive advantage of some sorts. And that makes you stand out.

For example, because I’ve spent the past two years writing this newsletter on tech careers, I find the data surrounding recruiting, the hiring market, and career progression really interesting.

And so it would be a competitive advantage for me to make a portfolio project in this space, as opposed to in a space like crypto which I don’t really care about.

The second aspect to building something fun is what’s in it for the hiring manager.

Let's say you want a job at Twitch. Don't just make a page that lists the top ten streamers.

Instead, make a page where people enter the name of two streamers and after your code has compared the stats of both streamers, a winner gets displayed in the style of a Mortal Kombat KO.

People like to do business with people they like. And if your portfolio project can convey a ton of your personality and energy, you’re going to have a much better chance of making an amazing impression.

**Technically (or domain) Relevant**

Use technologies that they have in their stack.

There are websites that help you find out what technologies companies are using to build their product. For client side code it's not very hard to find out by yourself: look at the source, look at the libraries that get loaded, beautify their code and have a look at what gets imported.

When building your project use as much of those technologies to show them that you are familiar with the technologies they use.

If your role is non-technical, just replace the word technical with domain. You want to build something that makes them think “Oh, X can already do the job because he knows so much about the field!”

**Explainable**

Hiring managers want you to be able to explain the decisions you made when building your project. Why did you use a monolith architecture stack instead of something else? Why did you decide to make the edges of the user’s profile box round instead of square?

Ideally, you start with some form of research question. This is your why. What do you hope to learn?

If you’re a data scientist, discuss your mode choice. It's fine to just use XGBoost for tabular data but at least discuss other choices that could be appropriate.

If you’re a product manager, set the scene: why did you solve this problem in the first place?

If you’re a marketer, identify the metric you’re trying to move: are you trying to increase traffic or improve conversion rate?

## Examples

I’m going to give you some examples and tactical advice for data science portfolio projects.

I recommend:

1. Choosing a project that leverages some prior domain knowledge you have within the field. This will allow you to differentiate your idea and separate you from the other off the shelf clone projects.
2. Come up with a solid research requestion
3. Hunting down data and wrangling it – don’t just download data\_science\_project.csv

Now that you have the data, you want to make sure that you fulfill the explainability criteria really well. Some things you can focus on:

* Discussion on model choice. It's fine to just create a benchmark model just using Random Forests or XGBoost for tabular data but discuss other choices that could be appropriate.
* Discussion on the data validation process. Are you using any custom notebooks or scripts? Tools like Pydantic? How do you check for class imbalances?
* Discussion on model output/metrics. How effectively has your original research question been answered? What are some different approaches you could have taken?

There’s a lot of value in working backwards from the types of roles you want to target and working backwards to build certain types of portfolio projects.

We can split portfolio projects into two buckets: **data cleaning and data storytelling.**

The first type of projects, data cleaning, really focus on data collection.

Examples of good ones:

* [Mining Twitter Data With Python](https://marcobonzanini.com/2015/03/09/mining-twitter-data-with-python-part-2/)
* [Cleaning Airbnb Data](https://brettromero.com/data-science-kaggle-walkthrough-cleaning-data)

Whilst data storytelling projects also incorporate technical complexity, especially when it comes to data gathering, they make sure to include a compelling narrative.

Examples of good ones:

* [Clinton Trump Hip Hop Lyrics](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/clinton-trump-hip-hop-lyrics/)
* [Analyzing 1.1 Billion NYC Taxi and Uber Trips](https://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/)

Both of these projects index high on the fun criteria as they tackle topics that are interesting.

## Sharing your portfolio

You have a great portfolio. And now it’s time to share it with the world.

Sharing can mean many things. You can send it to hiring managers, post it on Linkedin, post it on Hacker News – but the keys to doing any of these things successfully is in answering two questions:

*What did I build?*

*Why did I build it?*

Some good examples of answering the first question are the Show HN posts on Hacker News:

https://preview.redd.it/tzzelrkx5de91.png?width=2624&format=png&auto=webp&s=003744f3ef64595afde64832c7e4bfd14ef6d22e

For the second question, you want to tie it back to your interests and motivations. Sure, maybe you worked on that technology because your favorite company uses it and it will make you look good, but dig a bit deeper.

What excites you intellectually about the problem at hand? Why did you choose to explore the topic the way you did?

Your genuine interests here will shine and make you stand out.

\*\*\*

Once you start to put work out there that you *really* care about, getting that dream job is literally only one of MANY amazing outcomes that could happen.

14fgpm7,I feel like a fraud,"Hello,

I'm a so-called data scientist with 4 YoE and an academic background in maths (pretty much nothing in software engineering).

My first job out of college was in a small ""data team"" (I was the only DS, there were 2 others guys, mostly seniors and sort of a mix of Data Engineer/Devops/Software Engineer). Our team mission was to bring value to the company using data.

Job was pretty chill, tbh I haven't been doing much over the 4 years. Mostly failed POC on jupyter and a lot of non-DS-related stuff (like dashboarding type of stuff).

However, there was one initiative I took that resulted in something that was deemed valuable enough to be pushed into production. It was a mix of NLP/timeseries project which actually gave some very interesting results, although if I'm being honest, it is definitely not worth the 4 years of salary they paid me.

As I was asked to industrialize the solution, I had some help from my other 2 senior colleagues who introduced me to linux, git, docker/kubernetes, flask, airflow, and some good coding practices such as linting, testing, hinting, logging, classes and decorators on Python.

The thing is, they never reviewed my work nor made sure I was following all the recommended guidelines, and as I was overwhelmed by all those new concepts, I ended up just not following them, or not correctly at least.

Like sure, I'll use git to track my code. Guess what, I never work with branching and just commited everything on the same master branch.

Classes and decorators ? No that's too complex and abstract, let's just do it plain and simple.

Testing and hinting ? Maybe later.

Couple of times I have tried to motivate myself to learn all of this properly on my own, but although I have learned some stuff this and there, I have never reached that stage where I feel comfortable using all this, and always felt unmotivated afterwards by how vast those subjects are and how little I knew.

&#x200B;

3 months ago, my manager who used to be a technical guy but has been doing managing for quite some time now, and who for some reason always thought I was someone brilliant and creative out of the bunch (he led 3 other teams with a total of \~20 people) was hired by a mid-size company to become their head of data. He offered me a position here as a senior data scientist which I took. He then hired a couple of other data scientists (they introduced themselves as MLE rather than DS) with about 2 YoE.

Those guys are so good they are making me feel like a fraud. They are using git as if they invented the tool. The way they structured their code, using mostly classes and decorators everywhere just baffles me. They seem to have no trouble with devops concept (like CI/CD), API management, networks etc ... while I'm here struggling with the proxy of my VM just to reach the internet.

I've recently discovered the joy of reviewing PR on github and boy it is exhausting to follow what they do. I basically have to google everything as they are using stuff I didn't even knew existed. It probably took me 10 hours to review a bunch of code they wrote in probably one hour.

I am sure by now they see me as a fraud, and they seem to be both the kind of judging type (3 weeks in and they already had some heated arguments on software engineering). I think so far I was protected by my ""senior"" title and the fact that I have known our manager for quite some time now, but I'm expecting that this masquerade will not hold for long.

&#x200B;

I'm lost, IDK what to do. Is there a way for me to catch up everything in a short amount of time ? I understand that a regular data scientist with ""expertise"" in ML is no longer bankable and people now are turning towards ""full-stack"" MLE with a software engineering background, who are able to manage the entire pipeline and  produce professional code that is robust, readable and maintanable.",303,82,Simple-Airport8868,2023-06-21 19:22:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14fgpm7/i_feel_like_a_fraud/,0,datascience
125xdzd,We are opening a Reading Club for ML papers. Who wants to join? 🎓,"Hey!

&#x200B;

My friend, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Oxford and an MSc graduate from Cambridge, and I (a Backend Engineer), started a reading club where we go through 20 research papers that cover 80% of what matters today

Our goal is to read one paper a week, then meet to discuss it and share knowledge, and insights and keep each other accountable, etc.

I shared it with a few friends and was surprised by the high interest to join.

So I decided to invite you guys to join us as well.

We are looking for ML enthusiasts that want to join our reading clubs (there are already 3 groups).

The concept is simple - we have a discord that hosts all of the “readers” and I split all readers (by their background) into small groups of 6, some of them are more active (doing additional exercises, etc it depends on you.), and some are less demanding and mostly focus on reading the papers.

As for prerequisites, I think its recommended to have at least BSC in CS or equivalent knowledge and the ability to read scientific papers in English

&#x200B;

If any of you are interested to join please comment below

And if you have any suggestions feel free to let me know

idapmz,I suck as a data analyst. Should I leave the field?,"I always find myself making mistakes. I’ve been working at my first real job since May of last year, and I just can’t seem to improve this. I always end up making mistakes like forgetting to correct some formulas and producing incorrect values because of it, or not looking at the data in a more appropriate way. Now I feel I feel I’ve lost credibility and people are not going to take me seriously. No matter how much I try to check and double check what I have, I always seem to miss something and make some errors. 

I am more better at building something than checking numbers. For example, I can build dashboards, queries, troubleshoot, even ETL loads, then analyzing data and looking at the numbers from an analytical perspective. Not sure if I explained myself well here. 

Don’t know what to do except conclude that maybe this field isn’t for me.

moaujx,"All the wrong things with predicting purchase, churn and similar targets in digital marketing","Recently, I have been reading a lot about common prediction tasks in digital marketing like churn prediction and predicting the probability of purchase on a user level.   
From the articles and books I have read so far and my own understanding as well, there are several things that make such tasks more complicated in different ways.   


* It's pretty hard to commit the so-called Type III error when the model you build in the end doesn't answer the real business question. This can be illustrated by the now classical case of churn prediction. Even though it's not too difficult to build a binary classifier, it's not clear at all what the end users can do with those predictions. In general, it's more useful to do uplift modeling, but this creates another level of complexity because you need to conduct an experiment first to even collect the necessary data for uplift modeling.   

* Trying to interpret the results to stakeholders is another challenging part of the process. One of the issues is the falsely obvious belief that correlation implies causation, and the graphs you get from \`plot\_importance\`  and SHAP values do not really answer the questions like which feature defines users' behavior.  In addition, the traditional metrics used in classification are not really useful. It's often stated that there is this well-known trade-off between precision and recall in most real situations especially when the distribution of classes is heavily skewed. What I personally encounter now is that even the business guys do not have a very clear definition of success. They just want to get ""some insights"" and ""have a model"". I usually try to put it this way: we have a value of AUC score that equals X, which is overall a measure of the classifier's ranking ability. On top of that, here is the cumulative gain/lift curve which you can use to understand how useful the model can be as opposed to a random classifier. Honestly speaking, I realize that as a data scientist I have to answer all the questions myself and suggest something meaningful, but sometimes it feels like the end-users of the models have no idea about what they really want to have in the end, which makes everything super complicated.   

* To be more specific about the target misconception, I just recently found this post by Frank Harrell that emphasizes the idea that in most real-world cases what you really need to output is probabilities. This is more informative in general than just binary 0/1 answers that only appear when you make the threshold-related decision. The same applies to using improper scoring rules that are functions of the selected thresholds. It's not often taught in machine learning courses, but using accuracy as an evaluation metric might make sense for the Iris dataset, but much less frequently in real tasks.   

* Currently, I am working on a task where I am expected to predict the probability of a subscription purchase. The problem can be easily boiled down to the standard binary classification problem with all the issues mentioned above. There is some level of uncertainty when it comes to how the model will be used by the marketing team. My simplistic and naive idea is that the pragmatic way around this problem is to get a decently calibrated classifier that outputs probabilities (technically speaking, not yet probabilities but after some calibration, this is hopefully something similar). The scores are sorted and top X% users (based on the ""best"" value according to the cumulative gains plot) are selected for some form of communication. I realize that taking any percentage of users implicitly means that we are selecting a threshold, but the focus is different and we do not even need to report the shamefully low values of precision. Algorithm-wise, this is just plain old gradient boosting in XGBoost/LightGBM/Catboost.   


I have a feeling that a lot of us have encountered similar tasks in this field and I would highly appreciate any advice and discussion. If you have any great resources that discuss such tasks and approaches in detail, please mention them as well.

And at other companies, a data scientist is someone who reads academic papers and writes software to translate those papers into software production code that is used by other teams. This should be a machine learning engineer but companies define it as data scientist.

aj6ohk,Data Scientist is the new Business Analyst,"A relative of mine is in a top tier MBA program and, interestingly enough, shopping around internships in SV and Fortune 500 companies and to my surprise the internships are in ""Data Science"". After looking at some recent job postings and interviewing a shitload of MBA candidates/graduates this year it seems most programs are offering 2-4 courses that are basically intros to regression in R, some mid-level SQL, and graduating with ""Data Science and Analytics"" certificates.

What came to a surprise was that when I sat down and looked at alumni profiles at these companies 90% of the ""Data Scientists"" had absolutely no background beyond this and their role at large companies essentially revolved around fairly basic forecasting, regression and building dashboards.

15flo97,RANT - There's a cheating problem in Data Science Interviews,"I work at a large company, and we receive quite a lot of applicants. Most of our applicants have 6-9 years of experience in roles titled as Data Analytics/Data Science/Data Engineering across notable companies and brands like Walmart, Ford, Accenture, Amazon, Ulta, Macy's, Nike, etc.

The nature of our interviews is fairly simple - we have a brief phone call on theory and foundation of data analytics, and then have a couple of technical interviews focusing on programming and basic data analysis. The interview doesn't cover anything out of the ordinary for most analysts (not even data scientists), and focuses on basic data analysis practices (filter down a column given a set of requirements, get a count of uniques, do basic EDA and explain how to manage outliers). 

All interviewees are told they can use Google as we don't expect people to memorize the syntax, but we do expect them to have at least working knowledge of the tools we expect them to use. The interviews are all remote and don't require in-person meeting. The interviews are basically screen share of Google Colab where we run basic analysis.

In our recent hiring spree, out of the 7 potential candidates we interviewed, we caught 4 of them cheating.

Given their profile, I'm a bit amazed that they resorted to cheating. Whether it was by having someone else on the call helping them answer the question, or having someone entirely different answer their questions, and other notable methods that I don't want to share that we caught while they were sharing their screens. I've learned from my colleagues that there are actual *agencies* in India and China who offer interview 'assistance' services.

At this stage, our leadership is planning to require all potential candidates to be local - this eliminates remote option. On the same token, those cheaters passing the recruiter screening are quite frankly just making it worse for people who are actually capable. Questions become more theoretical and quite specific to industry, scope of hiring will be limited to people within specific domains, and improptu coding tests will be given out without heads up to hinder people from cheating and setting up whatever they do to cheat.

2. We've collected a ton of new jobs and companies, so we now have \~2,700 companies in our database and almost 100k open jobs!
3. We've overhauled the UX to make it less noisy and easier for you to find jobs you care about.
4. We also added [a feedback page](https://zensearch.jobs/feedback) to let you submit feedback about the app to us!

&#x200B;

I started building Zen when I was on the job hunt and realized it was harder than it should've been to just get notifications when a company I was interested in posted a job that was relevant to me. And we hope that this goal -- to cut out all the noise and make it easier for you to find great matches -- is valuable for everyone here :)

15vbkkn,How do you convince the management that they don't need ML when a simple IF-ELSE logic would work?,"So my org has hired a couple of data scientists recently. We've been inviting them regularly to our project meetings. It has been only a couple of weeks into the meetings and they have already started proposing ideas to the management about how the team should be using ML, DL and even LLMs. 

The management, clearly influenced by these fanc & fad terms, is now looking down upon my team for not having thought about these ideas before, and wants us to redesign a simple IF-ELSE business logic using ML.

It seems futile to workout an RoI calculation for this new initiative and present it to the management when they are hell-bent on having that sweet  AI tag in their list of accomplishments. Doing so would also show my team in bad light for resisting change and not being collaborative enough with the new guys.

But it is interesting how some new-age data scientists prematurely propose solutions, without even understanding the business problem and the tradeoffs. It is not the first time I am seeing this perennial itch to disrupt among newer professionals, even outside of data science. I've seen some very naive explanations given by these new data scientists, such as, ""Oh, its a standard algorithm. It just needs more data. It will get better over time."" Well, it does not get better. And it is my team that needs to do the clean up after all this POC mess. Why can't they spend time understanding what the business requirements are and if you really need to bring the big guns to a stick fight?

I'm not saying there aren't any ML problems that need solving in my org, but this one is not a problem that needs ML. It is just not worth the effort and resources. My current data science team is quite mature in business understanding and dissecting the problem to its bone before coming up with an analytical solution, either ML or otherwise; but now it is under pressure to spit out predictive models whose outputs are as good as flukes in production, only because management wants to ride the AI ML bandwagon.

Edit: They do not directly report to me, the VP level has interviewed them and hired them under their tutelage to make them data-smart. And since they give proposals to the VPs and SVPs directly, it is often they jumping down our throats to experiment and execute.",296,160,OverratedDataScience,2023-08-19 09:30:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15vbkkn/how_do_you_convince_the_management_that_they_dont/,0,datascience
111h9pp,Job Hunting Tip: Practice Interviewing with ChatGPT,"One very useful benefit I found with ChatGPT for job seekers is asking it to serve as a Hiring Manager that asks you questions for the specific role you're interested in.

To help it guide you, you need to provide it with some context based on the job description. For example, you list out the job description to ChatGPT and say that you want to be asked questions on causality and experimentation.

Here's the response from ChatGPT based on the following prompt I provided it after sharing the job description:

===**PROMPT BY ME===**

>I would like you to be a hiring manager. I'll be soon interviewing with you for a Data Science role, and you are going to ask me questions related to causality and experimentation. What are the questions you would ask to test my knowledge?

**==RESPONSE BY CHATGPT===**

Sure! As a hiring manager for a data science role, I would like to assess your understanding of causality and experimentation. Here are a few questions I might ask:

1. Can you explain the difference between correlation and causation, and give an example of each?
2. How do you design an experiment to test a causal hypothesis?
3. How do you ensure that the results of an experiment are valid and reliable?
4. Can you explain the concept of confounding variables, and how do you control for them in an experiment?
5. Can you explain the difference between a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and an observational study?
6. How do you measure the impact of a treatment or intervention in an experiment?
7. Have you worked with any causal inference methods such as propensity score matching or instrumental variables? Can you give an example of when you used them?
8. How do you determine which variables to include in an experiment, and how do you avoid overfitting in the modeling process?
9. Can you discuss any challenges or limitations you have encountered in designing and conducting experiments, and how you overcame them?
10. Can you give an example of a real-world scenario in which you applied causal inference or experimentation methods to solve a business problem?

====

You can ask ChatGPT to provide a summary answer for each. However, I would highly recommend you validate the answers by researching as well as ChatGPT can give confident, wrong answers.

Hope this helps others!",295,20,forbiscuit,2023-02-13 19:13:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/111h9pp/job_hunting_tip_practice_interviewing_with_chatgpt/,0,datascience
v7ti75,Does anyone else avoid calling themselves Data Scientist?,"Hey folks! Whenever someone asks me what's my job, I just say I'm a Data Analyst. I feel like people understand this title better than Data Scientist. Growing up, I always thought of Scientists who invented stuff. I don't call myself a Scientist because I think my work doesn't justify it and I think I'm not smart enough to be called a ""Scientist"".

rjat6u,Job Market from a Hiring Manager's point of view,"TL;DR: this is the most candidate friendly market I've seen for people with literally any level of actual experience - but the most brutal I've seen for people with no experience. If you have to, make it a priority to get *any* experience - even if non-DS related.

I've been a hiring manager for several roles over the last 4 years. In every case, I was looking for people with some experience - small teams, so I wasn't really in a position to take on a candidate to raise myself - I needed someone who could function pretty independently.

It has been hell. Everyone who has even 1 year of experience as a data scientist is going to be inundated with offers, and now that remote work has fully opened up, even in average COL cities you're fighting companies offering East/West coast salaries. 

On the other hand, every job ad I've put out has been inundated with applications from people with 0 experience.

What does that mean?

* When choosing an academic path, focus on something that will make you stand out - not on the path of least resistance. Example: I see a lot of people go routes like ""I got a BS in humanities, so I don't want to try to get into a MS in Stats because I'd need to cover too many prereqs, so I'm gonna do a bootcamp"". That is the wrong mentality. That will land you in the really long list of candidates that look like that. By contrast, someone with a legit humanities background and a legit MS in Stats will look *a lot* more interesting. 

* Evaluate programs based on how well they place students into jobs. This is especially true for MS in DS programs who normally put a lot more effort into it. Go on LinkedIn and see where their grads go work and in what roles. For example: a lot of programs will send their grads to entry level DS roles at companies where DS = Data Analyst. Which isn't bad - but it's a different baseline than starting out as a legit DS. As an example: I tried to recruit Texas A&M's stats department for MS and PhD students and most of them had offers lined up from FAANGs or NYC ad tech/fin Tech jobs. 

* As soon as you hit the 1 year mark at your job, start applying for your next job. I don't know how long this era will last, but right now companies are desperate to hire and they know they need to pay up to do so. Take advantage of that. This is not the era to sit around and hope your company will give you a raise higher than inflation. Go apply for jobs. 

* If you're not getting call backs and you have either a) a strong academic background (e.g., grad school from top 30 school with research publications), or b) any legit DS experience in a full time job, immediately assume that your resume needs work. Seek help, and not from academics, but from people in industry or professional resume writers. This sub can be helpful too.

EDIT: Two caveats here:

1. This doesn't apply to those on F1 visas. Getting a job on an F1 visa is going to be 10 times harder than if you already have a green card or you're a citizen. No way around that. 

2. If you suspect your resume may be an issue, listen to this podcast episode and look at the sample resume attached. If you want me to help you out, do that step first so we can speak the same language. https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/10/your-resume-stinks

* if you're having trouble landing the DS job you want, find a DS adjacent job and then move into DS in a year. Having even 1 year of real world exoerience will make hiring managers a lot more likely to hire you.",297,168,dfphd,2021-12-18 16:21:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/rjat6u/job_market_from_a_hiring_managers_point_of_view/,0,datascience

fpcltw,Data Scientists are just glorified analysts (and why Research Scientist is the new Data Scientist),"Data Scientist here in a mid-sized company in Bay Area tech. After working in this industry for few years, the fact that Data Scientist in no longer a true Data Scientist position is the only natural conclusion I can come up with. There are obviously those in companies, reputable or not, who get to do and productionize complex modeling solutions (especially if you have a PhD), but the overall trend is that most ""Data Scientists"" without PhDs in big companies have become SQL monkeys who don't even get to do something as simple as A/B testing. This is like if front-end web developers were rebranded as software engineers.

I mean it's even public knowledge too:  Lyft publicly stated how they rebranded the titles from analyst to scientist and data scientist to research scientist. This was  just to compete with other tech companies for talent that want the ""scientist"" in their title. [https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c](https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c). I was told by a buddy in FANG that Facebook is the one that started this trend.

How did this happen and what's the consequence? I don't know the precise origin, but I know that today what's driving this movement is the huge rush new grads with ""data science"" degrees, or perhaps waves of career changers from bootcamps who also want to find their gold.

What's the consequence? I think the consequence is that we all suffer from the rebranding, especially in terms of career development. First of all, it cheapens the name for everyone who holds this title. Second, those who have been doing true Data Science work (not just SQL all day for metrics tracking) will have to shift expectations and titles in order to preserve what they already have. Third, being stuck on menial tasks that don't impact business bottom line will make the job more expendable, meaningly highly susceptible to layoffs far more than those that are in the front lines of business/product impact. Fourth, this means lack of promotion and career development, since those who do get those have proven impact on business.

Yes, I have become jaded and pessimistic about the Data Science world in the Bay, especially not having a PhD myself that limits me from pursuing Research Scientists positions...

**EDIT:** It's quite funny that half of agree with me and half of you disagree vehemently. I actually want to be proven wrong in this case. But I'm nonetheless surprised that people couldn't care less about the HR who are cheapening the name of a scientist to make their job search easier and directing all their criticism toward a fellow Data Scientist just for pointing this situation out.

Also, yes, titles might not matter for you individually, but not having a clear breakdown of the work expectations in an organizational and institutional level is not a sign of progress. You wouldn't make this claim on the murky division is labor on government or hospital jobs for instance, or any positions of authority in public/private space.

Finally, Science as a title infers hypothesis, testing, validation through formulaic rules (mathematic or otherwise), etc. Yea sure at the end of the day, titles are just semantics, but the other extreme end of that is saying that ""well what's the problem of giving a someone who munges chemistry data the title of a ""Chemical Scientist""? Hell let's call anyone who deals with legal data a Lawyer. What this shows it that titles do matter to some degree, because it infers authority over a particular subject and the technical know-how. To throw this concept to the garbage can so that HR can have better leads on candidates feels a bit insulting.",295,165,None,2020-03-26 14:40:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fpcltw/data_scientists_are_just_glorified_analysts_and/,0,datascience

I have not seen more than 2-3 people leave in last 5-6 years I have been here. I am not planning a move anytime soon since I love the work and overall culture. However, I need a productive way to deal with situation.

Some other clarification - we are not being asked to train ""data analyst"" I would rather prefer that. We are being asked to train people who don't code and use an automated software to pick and dump data.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Old manager (data scientist) left and now a manager from data management is managing our team. He doesn't understand the project process or requirements. He trying to change a lot of things and one thing he is consistently focusing on is our salaries. He has repeatedly made comments that ""this"" (data science and analytics) team is paid more than other teams and he doesn't see why that's the case. In one one-on-one meeting he mentioned that there are many people on a certain level and company would not be able to support promoting everyone at these salaries hence we need to think about how to replace them once these people quit due to no promotions. We haven't had much luck while trying to hire external people (lack of good candidates). He insisted that we need to hire and train juniors from his team on data science process so that they can catch up and deliver when the time comes. His older team (data management) team works on selecting and filtering data, they have no experience or business understanding of the process. I resisted and mentioned that it's hard enough to find someone with basic knowledge and up-skill them to level they can deliver projects. It would be a very long and frustrating process to train people who have no background in statistics. Also, it would easily take 1-2 years before they can independently take charge to execute things and we should hire at a position if the person doesn't at-least has some basic knowledge or some hands on projects. I also proposed bootcamps/professional trainings. But he was insisting on personal training from current employees.

How to deal with this? He is expecting us to train people one on one so they can potentially replace us? He is one of the person who oversees the appraisals however there is a person above him managing the department as well, we don't have direct connects with this person so no idea what he know what he doesn't.

I'm a junior so can't find new job atm in this market. Also its a small startup of 40 people so I try to learn new things from my coworkers that will help me in the future

mnsqrl,Dank or not? Analyzing and predicting the popularity of memes on Reddit,"A new study in one of my favorite academic journals. 

[https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-021-00358-7](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-021-00358-7)

""Internet memes have become an increasingly pervasive form of  contemporary social communication that attracted a lot of research  interest recently. In this paper, we analyze the data of 129,326 memes  collected from Reddit in the middle of March, 2020, when the most  serious coronavirus restrictions were being introduced around the world.  This article not only provides a looking glass into the thoughts of  Internet users during the COVID-19 pandemic but we also perform a  content-based predictive analysis of what makes a meme go viral. Using  machine learning methods, we also study what incremental predictive  power image related attributes have over textual attributes on meme  popularity. We find that the success of a meme can be predicted based on  its content alone moderately well, our best performing machine learning  model predicts viral memes with AUC=0.68. We also find that both image  related and textual attributes have significant incremental predictive  power over each other.""",286,29,antichain,2021-04-09 22:56:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mnsqrl/dank_or_not_analyzing_and_predicting_the/,0,datascience

gthgfw,Interview at Amazon for Data Scientist Role -- how to prepare?,"I am currently a Lead Data Scientist at a large defense contractor, primarily applying data science solutions to business-facing homerooms. Think supply chain, business management, etc. 

A few highlights about me...

* Very strong SQL skills, and I have done a large amount of data ETL
* Moderately strong Python skills
* Top 1% on Stack Overflow (I answer a lot of SQL and Python questions, also ask some)
* Nearly 10 internal Trade Secrets awarded to products I have built
* B.S. in Information Technology, I am graduating in August with my M.S. in Computer Science w/ an AI concentration from Hopkins
* About 3.5 years of work experience out of undergrad, two internships at Defense contractors before that
* Also have security related certifications (Security+)
* I mentor both the cybersecurity and AI clubs for my high school (along with a few other alumni)

I was contacted on LinkedIn by a recruiter. I have never really had an intention of working at FAANG organizations. From what I have read both on Reddit and elsewhere, the ""work 7 days a week"" and high pressure culture doesn't fit what I am really looking for. However, the recruiter mentioned almost 60% more than I make now, so that was enticing.

I feel technically sound -- but I definitely don't know how succinctly I could give an answer to some technical questions. I've looked at:

Are these good resources? Should I be prepared to write an algorithm from scratch? Would it be easier things, like kmeans, or am I expected to code backprop from scratch? I've done these things from scratch before, but I used reference material... I am nervous about not being able to demonstrate my skills because of being too focused on providing these overly technical answers.

Any advice is appreciated!

ptlrx4,Are data analysts under appreciated?,"Having worked as an analyst, data scientist, product manager, the role I enjoyed the most is being an analyst. 

To clarify, I define an analyst someone who uses data to produce insights (call it Business Intelligence , Data mining, etc.).In my definition (everyone has a different one), a data scientist does Machine Learning on a production level scale while a data analyst does reporting, data mining, maybe  prototypes or smaller scale ML projects. 

Back to my point, I feel like data analysts get pressured + forced to level up and progress to be data scientists. 1) They get pressured by their data scientist peers because think they are higher on the social rank than analysts. 2) Forced meaning you can only earn so much as a data analyst before either becoming a data scientist or going into management. 

With that being said, data analysts are very under appreciated as not many people know as well as them. Show me a data analyst who has been in that role for several years, and I’ll show you someone who knows the business inside and out. Unfortunately, due to the above mentioned reasons, you rarely see experienced data analysts. 

This is a major reason why companies struggle to find value in AI/ML projects (85% of AI projects fail). Everyone wants to go and do ‘cool’ Machine Learning and Advanced AI, but without the dirty work done by the analyst, the project will struggle to bring value.  

Data analysts should get compensated just as much as data scientists because they bring just as much if not more value. 

Lastly, I’m not saying data scientists are over rated or anything, but as a data scientist you have to build models (building great models is a lot of work). You do not have the time to know the ins and outs of the business. Businesses today are very complex and there is almost always a gray area and exceptions. If you don’t see any gray areas, you are probably not looking hard enough. That is when you need to rely on your data analyst.",290,66,toceto_mk,2021-09-23 02:38:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ptlrx4/are_data_analysts_under_appreciated/,0,datascience
il4rer,"How to deal with impostor syndrome as a computer science graduate wanting to work as a data scientist or as a machine learning engineer, later wanting to transition into freelance consulting?","I am a recent computer science graduate (I earned a master's degree). I have an undergrad in information systems. I went through college math classes like calculus, multi-variable calculus, statistics, discrete mathematics and linear algebra.

As soon as I entered the master's program in computer science, I always felt that I was missing some math in comparison to people who have had a computer science undergrad. That thought haunted me. Because of that thought, I was reviewing math during my master's and took hard math courses other computer science students didn't want to enroll in because they heard they were hard. I passed those classes, even though sometimes it was brutally hard to balance that class alongside my difference exams (which I had since I came from information systems undergrad). In short, my past 2 years of computer science master's were brutally hard, but I had the chip on my shoulder from coming from an information systems undergrad and worked extra hard to pass classes (and sometimes more than just pass).

**In the past few weeks, I had this idea that I should review math from the ground-up (start off with all the Khan Academy videos, then move towards textbooks) because I most likely have gaps in my math knowledge.** Even though I know that most computer science master's degree holders have some gaps in their math knowledge (as does anyone), this thought won't leave me. I still have that chip on my shoulder coming from an information systems undergrad and this, I think, is my impostor syndrome.

**I want to be a data scientist or a machine learning engineer - but the positions I'm after are not some research positions where I'd be developing a new algorithm.** The positions I'm after are simpler - applying BERT to new languages, for example. After I get the hang of the job, I thought of doing freelance consulting work. If during my job I encounter some material I need to brush up on (whether it's math or something else) I can review it on the fly. Even if I have to read some paper on my job, usually the formulas there are already derived and if I don't understand them, I can ask someone on my job or I can ask people on this subreddit or something similar. And let's also not forget that while I may not remember how to find derivatives of complicated functions by hand, I did have all that math through my academic education.

**What do you think, data scientists of reddit? Does it make sense for someone in my position to review math from the ground-up, or is it the impostor syndrome speaking?** I am the kind of person that is always erring on the side of discipline and hard work, so this may now be backfiring, but maybe I should execute my plan of reviewing the math or maybe I should just relax.",290,38,A_Time_Space_Person,2020-09-02 11:08:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/il4rer/how_to_deal_with_impostor_syndrome_as_a_computer/,0,datascience

hpc6vz,"Does anyone else struggle with remembering, internalizing the basics?","I've taken schooling for this my entire life to be honest. It's always been mathematical and statistical, and in my second bout of education, focused more on computing to apply this math.

But for data scientists we have to know so much spanning different fields. **From math, statistics, to optimization, to data structures, and algorithms, to your specific programming language gotchas, more advanced statistical + computing algorithms including ML/DL/ etc...**

How can someone possibly remember all of this and retain all the different sources of knowledge in memory? It's not like I have not been taught this and didn't know the specifics before. But it's never efficiently stored in memory. For some very common basics, I have to look up and remember how they work again.

1. So take linear regression for example something I've studied multiple times before. It's the most basic. I can right now tell you the general formula of the equation, and what it's trying to do. But if someone were to ask me right now to explain the internals of gradient descent (DESPITE taking multiple courses that taught/used this concept), I wouldn't be able to tell you. I can tell you the gist, and I have some visualization of my mind of the process, in that it's essentially trying to look for the direction of highest negative change.  For logistic regression, I can tell you its for classification and that it uses MLE to solve, but would have to look up again the implementation. For example, I don't remember how MLE works but know its related to probability.
2. If someone were to then ask me to explain something that involves more computing and computer science. So say something about bytes, binary representation, how it's used. I can give you the general gist that it's used to represent/store data in an efficient manner. But that's it. I can't give you more specifics to that, and would probably have to learn it all again with more details.
3. With data structures/algorithms, despite learning it before, I can give you a general gist of what they involve, but that's it. For example, a dictionary is cool because it allows easy key lookup because it uses hash representation. A list is ordered and is iterable, etc... I understand the general concept of time complexity but probably will struggle if asked to figure out whether something represents exponential time. Just the other day, had to refresh on the differences between hashable and mutable, etc...

My point is, there's just so many different fields we have to have working knowledge on. And don't even get me started with more http, web servers, etc...  It's something I haven't been taught and haven't had the chance to learn yet as I'm still trying to remember, learn, maintain everything else. How do people REMEMBER all of this? I had to look up the basics of hypothesis testing the other day, as I remembered its gist, but not how to implement it.

1bln0ix,Scikit-learn Visualization Guide: Making Models Speak,"Use the Display API to replace complex Matplotlib code 

[ Scikit-learn Visualization Guide: Making Models Speak. ](https://preview.redd.it/pimy1i38a1qc1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31492e48a5d39171c60d8e96ee8698c670327e7)

# Introduction

 In the journey of machine learning, explaining models with visualization is as important as training them. 

 A good chart can show us what a model is doing in an easy-to-understand way. Here's an example: 

[ Decision boundaries of two different generalization performances. ](https://preview.redd.it/3rrwu8rfa1qc1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=9425bbe57deb98a854a40fdc0979149637078047)

 This graph makes it clear that for the same dataset, the model on the right is better at generalizing. 

 Most machine learning books prefer to use raw Matplotlib code for visualization, which leads to issues: 

1. You have to learn a lot about drawing with Matplotlib.
2. Plotting code fills up your notebook, making it hard to read.
3. Sometimes you need third-party libraries, which isn't ideal in business settings.

 Good news! Scikit-learn now offers Display classes that let us use methods like from\_estimator and from\_predictions to make drawing graphs for different situations much easier. 

 Curious? Let me show you these cool APIs. 

 

# Scikit-learn Display API Introduction

### Use utils.discovery.all_displays to find available APIs

 Scikit-learn (sklearn) always adds Display APIs in new releases, so it's key to know what's available in your version. 

 Sklearn's [utils.discovery.all\_displays](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.utils.discovery.all_displays.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.utils.discovery.all_displays) lets you see which classes you can use. 

    from sklearn.utils.discovery import all_displays
    
    displays = all_displays()
    displays

 For example, in my Scikit-learn 1.4.0, these classes are available: 

    [('CalibrationDisplay', sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay),
     ('ConfusionMatrixDisplay',
      sklearn.metrics._plot.confusion_matrix.ConfusionMatrixDisplay),
     ('DecisionBoundaryDisplay',
      sklearn.inspection._plot.decision_boundary.DecisionBoundaryDisplay),
     ('DetCurveDisplay', sklearn.metrics._plot.det_curve.DetCurveDisplay),
     ('LearningCurveDisplay', sklearn.model_selection._plot.LearningCurveDisplay),
     ('PartialDependenceDisplay',
      sklearn.inspection._plot.partial_dependence.PartialDependenceDisplay),
     ('PrecisionRecallDisplay',
      sklearn.metrics._plot.precision_recall_curve.PrecisionRecallDisplay),
     ('PredictionErrorDisplay',
      sklearn.metrics._plot.regression.PredictionErrorDisplay),
     ('RocCurveDisplay', sklearn.metrics._plot.roc_curve.RocCurveDisplay),
     ('ValidationCurveDisplay',
      sklearn.model_selection._plot.ValidationCurveDisplay)]

### Using inspection.DecisionBoundaryDisplay for decision boundaries

 Since we mentioned it, let's start with decision boundaries. 

 If you use Matplotlib to draw them, it's a hassle: 

* Use np.linspace to set coordinate ranges;
* Use plt.meshgrid to calculate the grid;
* Use plt.contourf to draw the decision boundary fill;
* Then use plt.scatter to plot data points.

 Now, with  [inspection.DecisionBoundaryDispla](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.inspection.DecisionBoundaryDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-inspection-decisionboundarydisplay), you can simplify this process: 

    from sklearn.inspection import DecisionBoundaryDisplay
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    iris = load_iris(as_frame=True)
    X = iris.data[['petal length (cm)', 'petal width (cm)']]
    y = iris.target
    
    
    svc_clf = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), 
                            SVC(kernel='linear', C=1))
    svc_clf.fit(X, y)
    
    display = DecisionBoundaryDisplay.from_estimator(svc_clf, X, 
                                                     grid_resolution=1000,
                                                     xlabel=""Petal length (cm)"",
                                                     ylabel=""Petal width (cm)"")
    plt.scatter(X.iloc[:, 0], X.iloc[:, 1], c=y, edgecolors='w')
    plt.title(""Decision Boundary"")
    plt.show()

 See the final effect in the figure: 

[ Use DecisionBoundaryDisplay to draw a triple classification model. ](https://preview.redd.it/501h2r27b1qc1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3614719f48e74c6aabd0d0754c6b08b80f87d02)

 Remember, Display can only draw 2D, so make sure your data has only two features or reduced dimensions. 

### Using calibration.CalibrationDisplay for probability calibration

 To compare classification models, probability calibration curves show how confident models are in their predictions. 

 Note that  [CalibrationDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay) uses the model's  predict\_proba. If you use a support vector machine, set probability to True: 

    from sklearn.calibration import CalibrationDisplay
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingClassifier
    
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000,
                               n_classes=2, n_features=5,
                               random_state=42)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 
                                                        test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
    proba_clf = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), 
                              SVC(kernel=""rbf"", gamma=""auto"", 
                                  C=10, probability=True))
    proba_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    CalibrationDisplay.from_estimator(proba_clf, 
                                                X_test, y_test)
    
    hist_clf = HistGradientBoostingClassifier()
    hist_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    ax = plt.gca()
    CalibrationDisplay.from_estimator(hist_clf,
                                      X_test, y_test,
                                      ax=ax)
    plt.show()

[ Charts drawn by CalibrationDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/ovcp8hcgb1qc1.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=93515b81145abbb70424dcc69bf0cf8569ac4e3a)

### Using metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay for confusion matrices

 When assessing classification models and dealing with imbalanced data, we look at precision and recall. 

 These break down into TP, FP, TN, and FN – a confusion matrix. 

 To draw one, use  [metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-confusionmatrixdisplay). It's well-known, so I'll skip the details. 

    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay
    
    digits = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1)
    X, y = digits.data, digits.target
    rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=5, random_state=42)
    rf_clf.fit(X, y)
    
    ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(rf_clf, X, y)
    plt.show()

[ Charts drawn with ConfusionMatrixDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/tfbcdin8f1qc1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1eaaf8e085e1cff8bb9c4bd971dade508010390)

### metrics.RocCurveDisplay and metrics.DetCurveDisplay

 These two are together because they're often used to evaluate side by side. 

 [RocCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.RocCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.metrics.RocCurveDisplay) compares TPR and FPR for the model. 

 For binary classification, you want low FPR and high TPR, so the upper left corner is best. The Roc curve bends towards this corner. 

 Because the Roc curve stays near the upper left, leaving the lower right empty, it's hard to see model differences. 

 So, we also use [DetCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.DetCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.metrics.DetCurveDisplay) to draw a Det curve with FNR and FPR. It uses more space, making it clearer than the Roc curve. 

 The perfect point for a Det curve is the lower left corner. 

    from sklearn.metrics import RocCurveDisplay
    from sklearn.metrics import DetCurveDisplay
    
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10_000, n_features=5,
                               n_classes=2, n_informative=2)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 
                                                        test_size=0.3, random_state=42,
                                                        stratify=y)

### Using metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay to adjust thresholds

 With imbalanced data, you might want to shift recall and precision. 

* For email fraud, you want high precision.
* For disease screening, you want high recall to catch more cases.

 You can adjust the threshold, but what's the right amount? 

 Here, [metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-precisionrecalldisplay) can help. 

    from xgboost import XGBClassifier
    from sklearn.datasets import load_wine
    from sklearn.metrics import PrecisionRecallDisplay
    
    wine = load_wine()
    X, y = wine.data[wine.target<=1], wine.target[wine.target<=1]
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3,
                                                        stratify=y, random_state=42)
    
    xgb_clf = XGBClassifier()
    xgb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    PrecisionRecallDisplay.from_estimator(xgb_clf, X_test, y_test)
    plt.show()

[ Charting xgboost model evaluation using PrecisionRecallDisplay.  ](https://preview.redd.it/8giy5tr8i1qc1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=06b96373c182f515a655d6f4029f44982c87b05d)

 This shows that models following Scikit-learn's design can be drawn, like xgboost here. Handy, right? 

### Using metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay for regression models

 We've talked about classification, now let's talk about regression. 

 Scikit-learn's [metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-predictionerrordisplay) helps assess regression models. 

    from sklearn.svm import SVR
    from sklearn.metrics import PredictionErrorDisplay
    
    rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
    X = rng.random(size=(200, 2)) * 10
    y = X[:, 0]**2 + 5 * X[:, 1] + 10 + rng.normal(loc=0.0, scale=0.1, size=(200,))
    
    reg = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVR(kernel='linear', C=10))
    reg.fit(X, y)
    
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 4))
    PredictionErrorDisplay.from_estimator(reg, X, y, ax=axes[0], kind=""actual_vs_predicted"")
    PredictionErrorDisplay.from_estimator(reg, X, y, ax=axes[1], kind=""residual_vs_predicted"")
    plt.show()

[Two charts were drawn by PredictionErrorDisplay.](https://preview.redd.it/9uxuobuti1qc1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=7db276b2a7d637cf53887e4cebe87b9a23593b9b)

 As shown, it can draw two kinds of graphs. The left shows predicted vs. actual values – good for linear regression. 

 However, not all data is perfectly linear. For that, use the right graph. 

 It compares real vs. predicted differences, a residuals plot. 

 This plot's banana shape suggests our data might not fit linear regression. 

 Switching from a linear to an rbf kernel can help. 

    reg = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVR(kernel='rbf', C=10))

[ A visual demonstration of the improved model performance.  ](https://preview.redd.it/fsu1yqg0j1qc1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=860447d0c8a1c0c38539f5fac16998ed928c8714)

 See, with rbf, the residual plot looks better. 

### Using model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay for learning curves

 After assessing performance, let's look at optimization with [LearningCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay).

  First up, learning curves – how well the model generalizes with different training and testing data, and if it suffers from variance or bias. 

 As shown below, we compare a DecisionTreeClassifier and a GradientBoostingClassifier to see how they do as training data changes. 

    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
    from sklearn.model_selection import LearningCurveDisplay
    
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, n_features=10,
                               n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, n_repeated=0)
    
    tree_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=42)
    gb_clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=50, max_depth=3, tol=1e-3)
    
    train_sizes = np.linspace(0.4, 1.0, 10)
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 4))
    LearningCurveDisplay.from_estimator(tree_clf, X, y,
                                        train_sizes=train_sizes,
                                        ax=axes[0],
                                        scoring='accuracy')
    axes[0].set_title('DecisionTreeClassifier')
    LearningCurveDisplay.from_estimator(gb_clf, X, y,
                                        train_sizes=train_sizes,
                                        ax=axes[1],
                                        scoring='accuracy')
    axes[1].set_title('GradientBoostingClassifier')
    plt.show()

[ Comparison of the learning curve of two different models. ](https://preview.redd.it/2ljyfl9aj1qc1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d7af8bd8a4295c54f6f5c3ce41caf2fd2ddb0c1)

 The graph shows that although the tree-based GradientBoostingClassifier maintains good accuracy on the training data, its generalization capability on test data does not have a significant advantage over the DecisionTreeClassifier. 

### Using model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay for visualizing parameter tuning

 So, for models that don't generalize well, you might try adjusting the model's regularization parameters to tweak its performance. 

 The traditional approach is to use tools like GridSearchCV or Optuna to tune the model, but these methods only give you the overall best-performing model and the tuning process is not very intuitive. 

 For scenarios where you want to adjust a specific parameter to test its effect on the model, I recommend using [model\_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay) to visualize how the model performs as the parameter changes. 

    from sklearn.model_selection import ValidationCurveDisplay
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    
    param_name, param_range = ""C"", np.logspace(-8, 3, 10)
    lr_clf = LogisticRegression()
    
    ValidationCurveDisplay.from_estimator(lr_clf, X, y,
                                          param_name=param_name,
                                          param_range=param_range,
                                          scoring='f1_weighted',
                                          cv=5, n_jobs=-1)
    plt.show()

[ Fine-tuning of model parameters plotted with ValidationCurveDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/5dcgo35jj1qc1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed3d587e59d31902951ba0c9869ccd2bc39476d4)

# Some regrets

 After trying out all these Displays, I must admit some regrets: 

 

* The biggest one is that most of these APIs lack detailed tutorials, which is probably why they're not well-known compared to Scikit-learn's thorough documentation.
* These APIs are scattered across various packages, making it hard to reference them from a single place.
* The code is still pretty basic. You often need to pair it with Matplotlib's APIs to get the job done. A typical example is DecisionBoundaryDisplay  
, where after plotting the decision boundary, you still need Matplotlib to plot the data distribution.
* They're hard to extend. Besides a few methods validating parameters, it's tough to simplify my model visualization process with tools or methods; I end up rewriting a lot.

 I hope these APIs get more attention, and as versions upgrade, visualization APIs become even easier to use. 

 

# Conclusion

 In the journey of machine learning, explaining models with visualization is as important as training them. 

 This article introduced various plotting APIs in the current version of scikit-learn. 

 With these APIs, you can simplify some Matplotlib code, ease your learning curve, and streamline your model evaluation process. 

 Due to length, I didn't expand on each API. If interested, you can check the [official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/visualizations.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com) for more details. 

 Now it's your turn. What are your expectations for visualizing machine learning methods? Feel free to leave a comment and discuss.

ywg9ur,Does anyone feel like R is actually vastly worse for dependency/environment management than Python?,"I hear people tout all the time how great package management is in R and how Python packages are a complete disaster/oen of the reasons R can be considered better than Python, but I've never actually run into an issue where a Python package installation had 1) an endless litany of unfilled dependencies that pip itself did not properly resolve or 2) where a package failed to install/use the correct version of a dependency.

With R I frequently run into issues (even with dependencies = T) where:

1. I try a simple installation of a package.
2. That installation fails because multiple dependencies failed
3. Those dependencies failed to install because they are missing their own dependencies or worse, they require an uncommon library that cannot be installed within R (i.e. Requires a sudo apt-get install command). Sometimes these are so numerous that tracking down everything that failed and why is a nightmare.

These certainly *happen* with Python but they don't happen in multiple layers of nonsense quite so often as with R. I feel confident that 95% of my projects would go fine just using pip, but I think I'm going to exclusively let conda manage my R installations, because it can be absolutely maddening trying to rely on R's built-in package management.",286,176,DwarvenBTCMine,2022-11-16 01:50:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ywg9ur/does_anyone_feel_like_r_is_actually_vastly_worse/,0,datascience

q8phlx,Is there a protocol for working with people who make really bad code?,"Hi all. I work in a very big company everyone knows, and just started on a new project. I was brought in to work on a new phase of this project so we're not starting from scratch. The existing team has brought me up to speed. 

What they've implemented is a train wreck (it works but not very elegant). I'm a solidly intermediate programmer and data guy. I don't stand so tall that I'm gonna judge anyone, but I definitely take care to write clean, commented code that others can read and debug if needed. 

I use functions appropriately. I've been doing Python for some years and started doing legit OOP this year. I got the hang of it. 

I am now inheriting someone's messy Python. Duplicate ""import \[some library\]"" statements, almost no functions, zero objects (which I realize is not always needed), passwords saved in scripts, only a few comments here and there. 

They've been saving SQL scripts in Teams. What? No one thought to create a repository in the company's private Github?? 

I'm sure some of you have been on this side of it (while some of you have been on the other side). How did you handle it?

nobqjn,Wrapping up a data-intensive PhD but most industry data science seems really boring. Are there interesting jobs?,"Title basically says it all. I'm wrapping up a PhD in [computational biology field] and starting to think about what's next for me. I don't really want to stay in academia at this point: the odds of getting the fabled tenure track jobs are low and I'm pushing 30 so I haven less interest in bouncing around post-doc to post-doc until getting a TT or burning out. 

A lot of my friends who graduated before me went the Data Science route - they're making good money (much better then we made as graduate students or would make as Tenure Track Profs) but the work just seems so *boring.* Instead of wrangling with interesting data types and trying to solve interesting problems, a lot of it seems to be basically financial or behavioral user data, and the goal is to deliver ""actionable business insights"", which always seems to boil down to optimizing profit-to-cost ratio. Far less of the interesting questions about mathematics and inference that pulled me into computational modeling and a lot more focus on business, learning how to pitch ideas to managers, etc. 

I don't give a d*mn about that, and kind of chafe at the idea of using skills I spent 6 years developing at the cutting edge of scientific research to help make already-wealthy investors in a company richer.

ayapts,Fired from my first real data science job at 6 weeks.,"I have been an analyst for several years, and recently moved into data science. Some of my roles have not always been terribly technical, because the employer was unwilling to provide tools. I have made do and practiced data science at home on my own time to improve or gain skills. 

I left my last job for what I thought was a long term data scientist role (government clearance!). It took 3 weeks to gain access to the data and once I finally did, it was incredibly messy and unstructured. I was told there will be significant and ample time for ramp up.

I got the call from the staffing agency to not return to the facility due to lack of performance. They felt I made zero progress even though I was fleshing out issues and creating data science documentation for the team. Even when I asked, there were no clear details of what the organization was looking for. I had a path forward and expressed what I was working on to add value. If they wanted/needed something else, no one said a word. 

At 6 weeks, fired. Back to the drawing board again. I was told TODAY when I was being terminated they needed someone to lead the team and hit the ground running asap.

q75ce8,Who has left data science and analytics? What are you up to now?,"I moved on from analytics two years ago and became a product manager. 

I was a data analyst for four years. 

1. Almost two years in market research with survey data building statistical models (mainly linear and logistic regression) in SPSS and Excel (with a bit of R here and there)
2. Nine months managing a SQL database where I was meant to be analysing the data but was mainly debugging a very bad production environment
3. 1.5 years as a data analyst in product analytics where I worked with retail sales and loyalty program data. I spent the first year doing data governance stuff with the client but later moved into an ML team and tried to figure out insights for end users without them having to search for them. 

Since becoming a product manager, I can still work with data and do the interesting analysis but then I spend most of my time using the numbers to drive decisions and if there is anything that requires long, time consuming ETL tasks, I can farm them out. 

So far, it's been a great move as I've always been more interested in decision science rather than writing code for the sake of it (I enjoy it in moderation but find more meaning using analysis to get shit done).

lrhcex,How do you handle business leaders asking you to inflate results to their liking?,"Hi everyone. I recently presented results on a pretty high profile project and while they were positive, the business leaders wanted to see more positive results. 

Now they are asking us to look at the data from new angles and group things together and then retest to see if we can find more significant findings. I tried to explain to them how doing things like this could create misleading results by introducing bias, etc. , but I don’t think I’m getting through to them. 

After pushing back a few times, I am being told I’m not being a team player or that I just don’t want to do the work when I’m just trying to stand up for what’s right and make sure we are presenting accurate information. Presenting misleading results could have serious consequences for myself and my team, and lead to the entire project being cancelled. 

This is my first DS project and my first DS job and I just don’t know how to handle the politics of all of this.  I was told that my willingness to stand up for what’s right was a positive thing and that I should continue speaking up. But now it’s being held against me. 

I feel like I’m stuck in an awkward situation: Do I bite my tongue and do the analysis that I know is wrong that could reflect poorly on me in the future? Or do I continue to speak up and risk losing my job?

How do you navigate situations like this? Thanks for your help!

EDIT: First of all, thank you for the awards! These are my first ones! Second, thank you so much for all of the sound advice! I’ll be heavily documenting things moving forward, and I’m going to continue to speak up when I feel like something isn’t right. I’ll also open myself up to other opportunities. I was previously committed to putting at least a handful of years here, but now I’m not so sure.

9psua7,"If you've been wondering about the disappearance of data from our federal databases, here's an excerpt from Michael Lewis' The Fifth Risk which explains what is going on.","
> After Trump took office, DJ Patil watched with wonder as the data disappeared across the federal government. Both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior removed from their websites the links to climate change data. The USDA removed the inspection reports of businesses accused of animal abuse by the government. The new acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mick Mulvaney, said he wanted to end public access to records of consumer complaints against financial institutions. Two weeks after Hurricane Maria, statistics that detailed access to drinking water and electricity in Puerto Rico were deleted from the FEMA website. In a piece for FiveThirtyEight, Clare Malone and Jeff Asher pointed out that the first annual crime report released by the FBI under Trump was missing nearly three-quarters of the data tables from the previous year. “Among the data missing from the 2016 report is information on arrests, the circumstances of homicides (such as the relationships between victims and perpetrators), and the only national estimate of annual gang murders,” they wrote. Trump said he wanted to focus on violent crime, and yet was removing the most powerful tool for understanding it.

> 
> And as for the country’s first chief data scientist—well, the Trump administration did not show the slightest interest in him. “I basically knew that these guys weren’t going to listen to us,” said DJ, “so we created these exit memos. The memos showed that this stuff pays for itself a thousand times over.” He hoped the memos might give the incoming administration a sense of just how much was left to be discovered in the information the government had collected. There were questions crying out for answers: for instance, what was causing the boom in traffic fatalities? The Department of Transportation had giant pools of data waiting to be searched. One hundred Americans were dying every day in car crashes. The thirty-year trend of declining traffic deaths has reversed itself dramatically. “We don’t really know what’s going on,” said DJ. “Distracted driving? Heavier cars? Faster driving? More driving? Bike lanes?”
> 

> The knowledge to be discovered in government data might shift the odds in much of American life. You could study the vaccination data, for instance, and create heat maps for disease. “If you could randomly drop someone with measles somewhere in the United States, where would you have the biggest risk of an epidemic?” said DJ. “Where are epidemics waiting to happen? These questions, when you have access to data, you can do things. Everyone is focused on how data is a weapon. Actually, if we don’t have data, we’re screwed.”
> 

> His memos were never read, DJ suspects. At any rate, he’s never heard a peep about them. And he came to see there was nothing arbitrary or capricious about the Trump administration’s attitude toward public data. Under each act of data suppression usually lay a narrow commercial motive: a gun lobbyist, a coal company, a poultry company. “The NOAA webpage used to have a link to weather forecasts,” he said. “It was highly, highly popular. I saw it had been buried. And I asked: Now, why would they bury that?” Then he realized: the man Trump nominated to run NOAA thought that people who wanted a weather forecast should have to pay him for it. There was a rift in American life that was now coursing through American government. It wasn’t between Democrats and Republicans. It was between the people who were in it for the mission, and the people who were in it for the money.

10a7kq4,I wrote up a guide showing how to do Data Science with ChatGPT.,"Just recently, I wrote up a guide on how to use [ChatGPT to build a website with Replit](https://buildspace.so/notes/chatgpt-replit-website?utm_source=r).

Got some pretty good responses, so I decided to write + document more of the applications I'm discovering.

**I'm actually really excited about this one, since I was in a graduate program for statistics.**

[Here's the guide](https://buildspace.so/notes/chatgpt-data-science?utm_source=r) for doing data sci with ChatGPT

The tl;dr is that I show you some of the crazy data sci stuff ChatGPT can do:

\- Read and analyze raw CSV data. I just had to copy and paste.

\- It could tell what kind of data you're feeding it judging by the header columns!

\- It will give you the python/r code on how to run specific analysis.

\- It even knew how to use scikit-learn to run regression models 🤯 (I mean, this makes sense since it's an AI tool lol).

Honestly, this is just crazy to me.

**Before I dropped out of graduate school for statistics, I often consulted non-technical researchers in the social sciences. It was always a pain for them to run datasets by themselves just to get some answers to their questions.**

Although ChatGPT isn't perfect (and does make mistakes), it's crazy where the tool is going.

I think this is really good news for a lot of people who are interested in doing research, but might feel too intimidated by needing to do stats. Obvi...some bad stuff could come from it. We'll see!

u5ebtl,General Assembly Data Science Immersive (Boot Camp) Review,"# Background:

In August 2021, I walked away from a systems administrator job to start a data science transition/journey.  At the time, I gave myself 18 months to make the transition-- starting with a three month DS boot camp (Sept 2021 - Dec 2021), followed by a six month algorithmic trading course (Jan 2022 - Jun 2022), and ending with a 10 month master’s program (May 2022 - Mar 2023).   The algo trading course is a personal hobby.

# Pre-work:

General Assembly requires all student to complete the pre-work one week before the start date.  This is to ensure that students can ""*hit the ground running.*""  In my opinion, the pre-work doesn’t enable students to hit the ground running.  Several dropped out despite completing the pre-work. I encountered strong headwinds in the course.  I found the pre-work to be superficial, at best.

The Pre-work consists of the following:

&#x200B;

[Pre-work modules](https://preview.redd.it/xou0f70n80u81.jpg?width=1197&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddae989e23f33a7a4024c4acd24b4f18b328588b)

# Pre-Assessment:

After completion of the pre-work, there is an assessment.

&#x200B;

[Assessment](https://preview.redd.it/bbk31j2y80u81.jpg?width=837&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97593417d346eb5aac3d3b1e4f097e02c730999b)

The assessment was accurate in predicting my performance (especially the applied math section).  I didn’t have any problems with the programming and tools parts of the boot camp.

My pain points were grasping the linear algebra and statistics concepts.  Although I had both classes during my undergraduate studies, it’s as if I didn’t take them at all, because I took those classes over 20 years ago, and hadn’t done any professional work requiring knowledge of either.

I had to spend extra time to regain the sheer basics, amid a time-compressed environment where assignments, labs, and projects seem to be relentless.

# Cohort:

The cohort started with 14 students and ended with nine.  One of the dropouts ***wasn’t a true dropout***.  He’s a university math professor, who found a data science job, one week into the boot camp.  I always wondered why he enrolled, given his background.  He said he just wanted the hands-on experience.  At $15,000, that's a pricey endeavor just to get some hands-on experience.

The students had the following background:

&#x200B;

* An IT systems administrator (me)
* A PhD graduate in nuclear physics
* Two economists (BA in Economics)
* A linguist (BA in Linguistics, MA in Education)
* A recent mechanical engineering graduate (BSME)
* A recent computer science graduate (BSCS)
* An accounting clerk (BA in Economics)
* A program developer (BA in Philosophy)
* A PhD graduate in mathematics (***dropped out*** to accept a DS job)
* An eCommerce entrepreneur (BA Accounting and Finance, ***dropped out*** of program)
* An electronics engineer (BS in Electronics and Communications Engineering, ***dropped out*** of program)
* A self-employed caretaker of special needs kids (BA Psychology, ***dropped out*** of program)
* A nuclear reactor operator (***dropped out*** of program)

# Instructors:

The lead instructor of my cohort is very smart and could teach complex concepts to new students.  Unfortunately, she left after four weeks into the program, to take a job with a startup.  The other instructors were competent, and covered down well, after her departure.  However, I noticed a slight drop off in pedagogy.

# Format:

The course length was 13 weeks, five days a week, and eight hours a day, with an extra 4 - 8 hours a day outside of class.

Two labs were due every week.

We had a project due every other week, culminating with a capstone project, totaling seven projects.

Blog posts are required.

Tuesdays were half-days-- mornings were for lectures, and afternoons were dedicated to Outcomes.  The Outcomes section was comprised of lectures that were employment-centric.  Lectures included how to write a resume, how to tweak your Linked-In profile, salary negotiations, and other topics that you would expect a career counselor to present.

# Curriculum:

**Week 1 - Getting Started: Python for Data Science:** Lots of practice writing Python functions.  The week was pretty straight-forward.

**Week 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis:** Descriptive and inferential stats, Excel, continuous distributions, etc. The week was straight-forward, but I needed to devote extra time to understanding statistical terms.

**Week 3 - Regression and Modeling:** Linear regression, regression metrics, feature engineering, and model workflow.  The week was a little strenuous.

**Week 4 - Classification Models:** KNN, regularization, pipelines, gridsearch, OOP programming and metrics. The week was very strenuous week for me.

**Week 5 - Webscraping and NLP:** HTML, BeautifulSoup, NLP, Vader/sentiment analysis. This week was a breather for me.

**Week 6 - Advanced Supervised Learning:** Decision trees, random forest, boosting, SVM, bootstrapping.  This was another strenuous week.

**Week 7 - Neural Networks:** Deep learning, CNNs, Keras. This was, yet, another strenuous week.

**Week 8 - Unsupervised Learning:** KMeans, recommender systems, word vectors, RNN, DBSCAN, Transfer Learning, PCA.  **For me, this was the most difficult week of the entire course**.  PCA threw me for a loop, because I forgot the linear algebra concepts of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.  I’m sucking wind at this point.  I’m retaining very little.

**Week 9 - DS Topics:** OOP, Benford’s Law, imbalanced data.  This week was less strenuous than the previous week.  Nevertheless, I’m burned out.

**Week 10 - Time Series:** Arima, Sarimax, AWS, and Prophet.  I’m burned out. Augmented Dickey, what?  p-value, what?  Reject what?  What’s the null hypothesis, again?

**Week 11 - SQL & Spark:** SQL cram session, and PySpark.  Okay, I remember SQL.  However, formulating complex queries is a challenge.  I can’t wait for this to end.  The end is nigh!

**Week 12 - Bayesian Statistics:** Intro to Bayes, Bayes Inference, PySpark, and work on capstone project.

**Week 13 - Capstone:** This was **the easiest week** of the entire course, because, from Day 1, I knew what topic I wanted to explore, and had been researching it during the entire course.

# My Thoughts:

The pace is way too fast for persons who lack an academically rigorous background and are new to data science.  If you are considering a three-month boot camp, keep that in mind.   Further, you may want to consider GA’s six month flex option.

Despite the pace, I retained some concepts.  Presently, I am going through an algo trading course where data science tools and techniques are heavily emphasized.  The concepts are clearer now.  Had I not attended General Assembly, I would be struggling.

Further, I anticipate that when I begin my master’s in data science , it will be less strenuous as a result of attending GA’s boot camp.

**At $15,000**, if I had to pay this out of my own pocket, I doubt I would have attended.   With that price tag, one should consider getting a master’s in data science, instead of going the boot camp route.  In some cases, it’s cheaper and you’ll get more mileage.  That's just my opinion.  I could be wrong.

The program should place more emphasis on **storytelling** by offering a week on **Tableau**.  Also, more time should have been spent on SQL.  Tableau and more SQL will better prepare more students for more realistic roles such as Data Analyst or Business Analyst.  In my opinion, those blocks of instruction can replace Spark and AWS blocks.

**Have a plan.**  You should know why you want to attend a DS boot camp and what you hope to get out of it.  When I enrolled, I knew attending GA was a small, albeit intensive, stepping stone.  I had no plan to conduct a job search upon completion, because I knew I had gaps in my background that a three-month boot camp could not resolve.  More time is needed.

Prepare to be unemployed for a long time (six to 12 months), because a boot camp is just an intensive overview.   Many people don’t have the academic rigor in their background to be “data science ready” *(i.e., step into a DS role)* after a 12 week boot camp.

n7vzf6,Career path options as a current Data Analyst,"Hi all,

Apologies in advance if I'm breaking any rules or if this is more suited to the weekly thread. 

I've been working as a Data Analyst for a healthcare company for the past year. A lot of my work surrounds creating queries to track certain metrics then building dashboards to create insights using visualization tools. 

I do like the field, but unsure of where to move next. I do enjoy the coding aspect of my position (Lots of SQL, don't like excel as much), as well as hacking away at a problem and figuring out how to fix certain issues with the code we have. 

However, I hate coming up with insights and solutions. I don't mind creating the dashboards, but I don't like the proactive and analytical work that comes with it. ""Oh that's a good find, maybe we should look into this next"". I enjoy more when there's a problem to fix, then I fix that problem. 

Does data engineering fit more into the interests I've mentioned above? I imagine a role as a Data scientist would be more similar to what I'm currently doing.

u2lmit,No more high school calculus,"Every now and then the debate revolving math high school education flares up. A common take I hear is that we should stop pressuring kids to take calculus 1 by their senior year, and we should encourage an alternative math class (more pragmatic), typically statistics.

Am I alone in thinking that stats is harder than calculus? Is it really more practical and equally rigorous to teach kids to regurgitate z-scores at the drop of a hat?

More importantly, are there any data scientists or statisticians here that believe stats should be encouraged over calculus? I am curious as to hear why.",272,209,TikTok_Pi,2022-04-13 08:31:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/u2lmit/no_more_high_school_calculus/,0,datascience

zejzzs,Chat_GPT,"This weekend millions of people rushed to check the Chat_GPT. This fueled many discussions regarding the job security of the future. People like Paul Krugman started talking about the future of job and massive job loss as the result of the AI which will be disruptive of course. And this time unless previously that the job loss was happening in the low skilled job categories, it will happen to the skilled workers. Any thoughts about what to do and how to persuade a new job specially after knowing that data analysis related jobs will be very vulnerable to AI technologies. 

“It's true that as AI and machine learning technologies continue to advance, they are likely to have an impact on many different fields, including data science. However, it's important to remember that while AI may automate some tasks and make certain job roles obsolete, it is also likely to create new job opportunities in areas such as AI research, development, and implementation.

In terms of what job you should pursue in the future, it's difficult to say for certain. The best thing to do is to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in AI and machine learning, and consider pursuing education and training in these areas. This will give you the skills and knowledge you need to adapt to the changing job market and take advantage of the new opportunities that are likely to arise.

It's also important to remember that there will always be a need for human expertise and creativity in many fields, including data science. So, even as AI continues to advance, there will likely still be plenty of opportunities for skilled data scientists who are able to think critically, solve complex problems, and apply their expertise to new challenges.”

qvkuc4,Messed up my career by pivoting to DS. Wondering if it's too late to switch to MLE,"29M, 6YoE, living in Europe. Did a Bachelors in SWE, had a FAANG internship but bombed the conversion interviews (still can't forgive myself for missing that opportunity! Really wish I did more LC grind).

After that I spent one year as a SWE at a noname company, but quickly became bored. I still enjoyed the engineering aspect of it, so had this ""brilliant"" idea that I should just start specialising in something cool - and as a result got into ML, did a Masters in DS and started looking for positions with ""Data Science"" in the title.

This is where things really went wrong for my career. 5 years and 3 jobs later I have now *finally* realised that most DS roles are not supposed to be engineering positions in the first place, but are just glorified business intelligence / product analytics jobs. I am now a ""Senior DS"" at a well-known mid-sized company 1-2 tiers below FAANG pay-wise. 70% of my job these days is building dashboards. The remaining 30% are random ad-hocs / data pulls for product owners. I haven't written a single line of production code in the last year.

Here is what's really sad - what I was looking for all these years **did** exist on the market, but this role has always been called **MLE**, not **DS**! I have also realised that I should stop working at mid-sized companies, as 99% of these are simply not mature enough to have any meaningful ML applications. The [""trimodal nature""](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/) article has also been quite an eye-opener for me - never realised just how underpaid I was compared to FAANGs in Europe.

Basically it took me 6 years to finally pin down my ideal career path (an MLE at a large established firm), but I now have a bitter realisation that I have deviated from it way too much to be successful any time soon.

I can now see two options for myself:

1. Stay on the ""deviated"" DS path and grow more towards a ""business problem solver"" / analytics manager type of role. My manager actually thinks I am really good at talking to people and keeps delegating more and more of his team lead responsibilities to me. Ironically, talking to people is the part of my job I hate the most. I am now due to start managing a team next year, but frankly not looking forward to it at all - to me this will only mean more office politics and fewer opportunities for technical growth (also tbh it just doesn't look like I'm going to get a raise that would justify it).
2. Try and go back into an engineering role, ideally MLE or maybe DE. Quite a few of my peers from uni are now in mid-senior roles at FAANGs, and I am wondering if it would be wise to play catch up at this stage. While there is definitely a huge gap between me and them skill-wise (5 years of no prod experience must have been detrimental...), I still do have solid CS fundamentals, can write clean code and unit tests, can use tools like git and docker etc. Totally expecting to be heavily lowballed if I manage to get into a big company, but wondering if it would still be worth it, as it would at least bring me back on track.

Overall I feel pretty demoralised tbh, as whatever I choose to do next, I'm still going to have to pay a lot for all the career mistakes I've made so far. This is sad, as I actually used to be top-5 in my class, and overall people tend to think I'm smart, but I've sort of ruined my early career by making all these wrong decisions. I am also trying to incorporate reading more engineering books / grinding LC into my daily routine, but without much success so far as I feel pretty burnt out tbh.

Looking for advice on what I should do in my situation. Do people have any success stories about going from DS to a MLE role?",270,141,ds9329,2021-11-16 23:09:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/qvkuc4/messed_up_my_career_by_pivoting_to_ds_wondering/,0,datascience

146ofs6,How do you remember everything (theory/code) as a data scientist?,"I’m currently working as a Data Analyst/Scientist. It’s my first proper job since I completed my undergrad, and then PhD in Physics. 

I have a solid grasp of advanced mathematics, but I’ve never had any “formal” statistics training. I’m also a competent programmer, but I’m certainly not at the computer science or software developer level. I can write R or Python code which gets the job done but it isn’t always pretty, and will often google for solutions. Because of this, I’m sort of having to pick up things as I go along, which is okay but seems a bit overwhelming at times. 

I’m completely comfortable with exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics etc. However, in my role, I often spend a few weeks at a time working on different projects. Sometimes I’ll work with inferential stats (e.g. using chi squared), and permutation testing. Then I’ll be doing predictive modelling and use something like logistic regression. 

Each time, I understand how these techniques work in terms of the mathematics, but by the time I come to look at them again, I’ve forgotten at least some of it. This especially applies to whenever I’ve tried to teach myself something like Bayesian stats/probability, or any time I read about things like neural networks, PCA, K-means, NLP techniques, as I don’t really use these in my role.

I wouldn’t say I’m a particularly forgetful person, it’s simply that I can’t remember all of these different statistical approaches and techniques in any great detail. Do I need know all of these well to be a good data scientist, or is it typical to end up “specialising” in one or two areas (E.g. predictive modelling, forecasting), depending on where you work?

On a side note - do I need to have a solid personal profile (E.g. GitHub projects) to do well in my career, or once I’ve got experience is that less relevant? I say that because outside of work, I prefer relaxing and doing other things that I enjoy - I really value work-life balance, and don’t necessarily care about making a ridiculous amount of money as long as I’m decently well paid.",265,71,JLane1996,2023-06-11 08:26:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/146ofs6/how_do_you_remember_everything_theorycode_as_a/,0,datascience
v183x2,Why knowing the math and/or algorithms matters,"First and foremost, I don't want this to come across gatekeepey. In my opinion the fact that Keras, sklearn, tidymodels, ... abstract away most math is a blessing. Not everyone needs to know the details of their methods and algorithms, especially if it's just a hobby or even a one off model a SWE or scientist wants to use.

What I do feel strongly about is that once you go beyond that level and want to make a career out of this field going beyond these abstractions helps you understand what's going on. They enable you to explain the results of your blackbox model, even if it's just to yourself. They also help you debug your models and reason about the plausibility of your output.

Let me give two super recent examples I encountered:

When I was playing around with some old bayesian neural network code in Matlab (which I never use). I decided to change the activation function from tanh to relu. As soon as I did the performance absolutely tanked beyond belief. This immediately should prompt you to check the initialisation strategy Matlab uses. Lo and behold: it initialises a ton of neurons as negative values. Case closed here.

When plotting Xgboost's results I saw many negative values in the output even though the dataset only had > 0.  This threw me off because trees should not extrapolate but rather predict what they've seen. This is actually a semi-common occurence and is just due to how xgb works, the first tree is fit on (x, y) and the subsequent on (x, y - gradient). Depending on your use case this can be problematic, good luck explaining why you have e.g. negative predictions for sales. Swapping out xgb for RF, which obviously uses a different procedure, solved this problem.

These are two simple cases, there's tons more I've experienced in the last few months. I'm sure that you can figure these out with google-fu as well, but having confidence in your model's results is super important if you want to take your career to the next level in my opinion.",265,98,None,2022-05-30 19:42:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/v183x2/why_knowing_the_math_andor_algorithms_matters/,0,datascience

htynsr,How to introduce good engineering practices to a corporate data science team?,"I work in a small data science team (5-ish people) at a large, non-tech company. We work with very large data sources and have solid infrastructure, but the technical skills of the team are very low. The team is all data scientists (myself included) with decent theoretical knowledge, but minimal experience with good coding/development practices.

I've worked as a (junior) software engineer in the past, and although I consider my knowledge to be pretty modest, it far exceeds that of the rest of the team. I'd like to introduce better practies to my current team, such as code reviews and writing tests, but I've never worked anywhere that had a great approach to development so I'm not sure how to go about it.

We mainly work on projects individually, that are usually unique and have little in common, so there's not much standardisation that can be done. We use git, but basically just commit straight to master, and most of our work is analsyis rather than anything that's productionised. It's rare for multiple people to work on the same codebase and even rarer to do so at the same time. We don't really use development methodologies like scrum/kanban, as we mostly work independently so people just manage their own work.

Any thoughts on where the best place to start would be? I'm not sure where to begin given the nature of our work and the low technical proficiency of the team.

i9tapi,Technical Interview,"I just finished a technical interview and wanted to give my experience on this one. The format was a google doc form that had open ended questions. This was for a management position but was still a very technical interview. 

Format was 23 questions that covered statistics (explain ANOVA, parametric vs non parametric testing, correlation vs regression), machine learning (Choose between random forest, gradient boosting, or elastic net, explain how it works, explain bias vs variance trade-off, what is regularization) and Business process questions (what steps do you take when starting a problem, how does storytelling impact your data science work)

After these open ended questions I was given a coding question. I had to implement TFIDF from scratch without any libraries. Then a couple of questions about how to optimize and what big O was. 

Overall I found it to be well rounded. But it does seem like the trend in technical interviews I've been having include a SWE style coding interview. I actually was able to fully implement this algorithm this time so I think I did decent overall.",264,50,DS_throwitaway,2020-08-14 20:10:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/i9tapi/technical_interview/,0,datascience

9xxm3w,Landed my first job as a ‘data scientist’,"I’ve been working as a business analyst for the last two years feeling underutilized and I finally did it! 

Data scientist at a pre IPO tech company in the Bay Area. Feels good man.

AMA / just want to celebrate because most people in my life are already techies and/or don’t care...


------------------------------------------------

Edit to answer the major questions being asked:

First of all thank you so much for the love! Really appreciate it.

My background - Stats undergrad from a rigorous school, no MS or PHD. Got a job as a business analyst, realized I could do more with my skills. 

After that, I hate to be a cliche but what got me the furthest was projects. Find reasons to get excited about the technology, build projects. Go to hackathons, build projects. Add stuff to your blog, github, etc. There are no MOOCs or blogposts that will get you the experience of actually trying to process and model real data with real data problems.

Once you do enough of these, you can start to talk data science with other professionals at a level of comfort that signals that you're not bullshitting just to get a job. 

One other piece of advice I have is to push yourself at your current role in the right direction. I realized that while my current job wasn't a data science role, there were non technical things I could do to help become a better data scientist eventually - things like getting really good at SQL queries, building visualizations and focusing on story telling around the data (even just in powerpoint format). 

Combining this with the more technical data science related stuff in my own time helped a lot - the business side of data science is underrated but often what employers are really looking for.

The last thing I wanted to share is that it was not easy, and interviewing is really hard. I was doing several personal projects, built a blog, participated in hackathons, participated in kaggle challenges, going to meetups, linkedin, etc. and I still bombed at the beginning. Doing these things got my foot in the door - I had the opportunity to interview for top companies such as Facebook but I tanked at the beginning. It was embarrassing and humbling - but do not give up! Take interviews whenever you get a chance just to practice those skills and eventually it will become more natural.

That's all for now, can add more based on interest! 



------------------------------------------------

Edit #2: Remembered one more thing. There are going to be haters on your journey. People will gatekeep, claim that you're not doing 'real data science', or say the market is overflooded with data scientist wannabes. There's probably some truth there, but I had to keep reminding myself that everyone starts somewhere, and in the end this is just a career choice for now. Not the end of the world - ignore them and keep pressing on.

rvya1w,"Those of you who are taking Data Science courses at a university, what's the most memorable moment you've witnessed in a data science class?","Lots of questions in this subreddit have to do with career advice or discussing the job market, but I want to do something more fun. I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science but have taken a plethora of data science courses offered at the undergrad level at my university (some classes intertwine with master's level courses) and I wanted to share and see if other students have similar, memorable, or fun experiences in their classes.

&#x200B;

For me, last semester, I took a data mining course and in one of our assignments, we were tasked with  using K-means clustering on a dataset of our choice. One group decided to do clustering of k = 6 based off of two explanatory variables: one that I can't really recall (let's just say it was income) and the other one was UserID. Not only did I visibly cringe, but I had to stop myself from facepalming. I couldn't believe a group decided to use UserID and another variable and try to draw meaningful analysis from it. There was a part of me that wanted to raise my hand and ask questions about their cluster but the professor got to them first and went in about how you're not supposed to use UserID in any type of analysis. They had other issues with their presentation and she went into those as well, making it clear that the group wasn't prepared for what hit them and I kind of felt bad. She gave the group an opportunity to make up the assignment and come up with a legitimate cluster with legitimate analysis, so that's a saving grace.

8u489i,A Beginner’s Guide to Data Engineering — The Series Finale,"Hi all,

Data engineering is a very important field, but it is new, often under-appreciated, and rarely discussed relative to its close cousin Data Science. I still remembered the first time I was trying to learn Luigi, an open-sourced project from Spotify for ETL, and I struggled a lot to find accessible materials.

Having worked at Airbnb for a few years, I was really fortunate to learn data engineering from some of the best data engineers in the industry. As such, I would like to share my experience and learnings so this topic can become more accessible to others.

o0neg0,Does knowing R instead of Python makes you unhireable?,"Hello!

Sorry for another R, Python post. 

Recently I got a task at work in which I had to read through multiple sheets of excel, clean, transform, reshape it and make it into a single dataframe. I hadn't done this type of task in either R or Python. Since, it was not really a time constraint task, I decided to do it in both and learn how to do it in both languages. I am better with R than Python. I barely know Python actually. So I started doing it in R and comfortably (with google) did it without taking much time. After that I tried it in Python but I'm still struggling to finish it. I will be able to do it but it's taking me significantly more time than R.

Is that just the learning curve of Python since I barely know the language or some things are just easier in R and I should just do it in the language I'm comfortable with? I'm afraid that that I'll never be able to learn Python like this and won't getting any interviews since I don't know how to do stuff in Python.

Thanks! Sorry for the long post.",265,173,quite--average,2021-06-15 20:09:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/o0neg0/does_knowing_r_instead_of_python_makes_you/,0,datascience
1bf181u,A website for you to learn NLP,"Hi all,

I made a website that details NLP from beginning to end. It covers a lot of the foundational methods including primers on the usual stuff (LA, calc, etc.) all the way ""up to"" stuff like Transformers.

I know there's tons of resources already out there and you probably will get better explanations from YouTube videos and stuff but you could use this website as kind of a reference or maybe you could use it to clear something up that is confusing. I made it mostly for myself initially and some of the explanations later on are more my stream of consciousness than anything else but I figured I'd share anyway in case it is helpful for anyone. At worst, it at least is like an ordered walkthrough of NLP stuff

I'm sure there's tons of typos or just some things I wrote that I misunderstood so any comments or corrects are welcome, you can feel free to message me and I'll make the changes.

It's mostly just meant as a public resource and I'm not getting anything from this (don't mean for this to come across as self-promotion or anything) but yeah, have a look!

v4u6e4,Why should we normalize our data? Are there any situations in which we *won't* want to normalize?,"I've seen in a few projects that when we're dealing with a feature that has a lot of variance (e.g. funding awarded to a startup which can go from 100k - 100 million+), we normalize it. I've usually seen this done by either taking the log, or just making the data be in standard units (with mean 0, standard dev. 1). 

Now I'm not able to wrap my head around \*why\* we want to do this, or how this makes a model more accurate. Wouldn't a model recognizing a much higher value as a stronger indicator be a good thing? For example, if we're trying to predict the survival rate of a disease for people, and one of the features for a person is income, that would probably be something we would want to normalize. 

But I'd argue that regardless of gender / race / location / profession / whatever other feature we have, a person raking in a few million per year is going to probably going to survive whatever disease just 'cause they have access to the best care in the world. In this case I'd probably hold off on normalization. Is this a valid thought process? Or is this an example of me pushing a pre-conceived bias onto a model? In this specific problem my bias might actually be right, but when dealing with a problem / domain I have no clue about, refusing to normalize might mean I'm unintentionally assuming something.",262,82,stuffingmybrain,2022-06-04 17:56:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/v4u6e4/why_should_we_normalize_our_data_are_there_any/,0,datascience
