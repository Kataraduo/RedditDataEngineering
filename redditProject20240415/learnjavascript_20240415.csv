c3hvb2,"Just ran into a very wise noob, thought Id share his technique.","Background: Im a sr dev at an agency, have been for awhile now, been doing webdev related work since '99. 

New kid is hired. Early 20s, maybe 22? Sharp. Ver sharp.

Hes new to VueJS but like I said, sharp. Took me a few days to get comfortable with it. He has no react / angular / vue background or experience other that hearing about it here and there, but his JS is strong. I task him with learning Vue, on his own, on company time, as a new large client may require it in the near future.

Next day this kid comes into the office and knows Vue pretty well.

Within the week, hes caught up to us.

Soon, Im sure he will be teaching us stuff.

I ask him how he studies. Heres what he said (paraphrased).

""I approach it like a workout. I find an exercise, and I do it. Then I delete it, and redo it. Then I redo it. These are my reps. I find a similar exercise, and I do that next. This is like doing a new set, like going from tricep to bicep. You need to engage the same muscles in similar but differing ways. For one set, I just scaffold the app. Five reps of that, tearing it down and starting anew each time. For the next set, I took the scaffolded project and added several directives. Five sets of that, starting with the bare scaffold each time. And so on.""

It struck me how inefficient my learning pattern is. Ill make a whole app, and forget many steps / features / techniques / reasons. This kid is not forgetting stuff. Its interesting and Im going to give his method a try.

tl;dr; Interesting approach to learning: treat it like a workout with sets and reps

Hello everyone,

I’m Dr. Josh Bastean, and I teach web development and education courses at Coker University. With all the recent insanity, all our courses have moved online. I am in the process of recording the entire content of my Modern Web Development course, and decided to go ahead and post the videos on YouTube, hoping to help more people learn the joys of web development.

I posted about this a few months ago and had lots of great feedback, so I wanted to reach out again to hopefully help anyone who hasn't already seen it.

[Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fOmsPg4YcdQLREdVWi1Fb04esgmMzarL2Dcux6v27n8/edit) for a brief overview (aka ""syllabus"").

[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQSmIhc0GVPPhpBAC3y6xChtOz3RJ8abN) for a link to the YouTube playlist.

I have already uploaded about 2/3 of the total course videos, and will continue to upload new ones as I complete them. As of right now, I’ve covered all of the front-end and started on back-end with Node.js, Express, EJS, and APIs. I'm currently working on the videos that start the final project (which we build over the last several weeks of the course): a ""Yelp Clone"" website focused on the topic of your choice. I'm doing Comic Books, but pick something you enjoy. We'll be adding MongoDB, Passport, EJS-Flash, pushing our code to Github, and deploying to Heroku.

I hope this helps a few people learn to love programming as much as I do. I started by watching these types of videos, and I wanted to pay it forward to the next generation.

I see new programmers going through Imposter Syndrome everyday and thought if I can make even 0.1% difference then it's worth it, So **If any of the group members here need any JS help or guidance, Feel free to comment or personally DM me, and I will try my best to answer and help.**

**I am not selling anything, I do not own any course, any membership site etc**.. just want to help group members. Not doing this for karma or upvotes either, feel free to downvote, upvote or whatever, just want to share the little knowledge I have with the willing.

**About Me:** I am self taught freelance web developer with experience in FullStack Javascript and typescript, has built many projects for international clients in my freelancing carrier.

My Tech Stack is MERN and SERN (S for SQL).

That's pretty much all, thank you for reading :)

&#x200B;

**EDIT: So majority of questions here in the comments and in my DMs were about one topic**

>What do i have do to be ready to build projects?

or

>I keep watching videos and tuts but when i set to build a project, i feel lost, what should i do?

**You get the idea,** 

**so today i got a notification from youtube about a video on this same topic, and to be really really honest, it was THE most accurate video on this topic i have ever watched... the things he explain in the video, that is exactly what i did to be at this stage where i can literally build anything my clients demand from me.**

rhocth,I Wrote a Script to Download Every NFT,"By now, you might have learned how to right click and save or screenshot NFTs. But compared to what I'll show you in this post, that'll just look like petty theft. I'm going to show you how to create a script to download **tens of thousands** of NFTs in just **minutes**.

Memes aside, I thought this was a fun project to get more familiar with Node.js and Puppeteer, a library you can use for web scraping and more. If that sounds interesting, read on. And if you want to follow along better, [here's the GitHub](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/nftgrabber) with the code.

(If you'd like to watch this post in video format, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fBSWSMGNXM).)

## Casing the Joint

We're going to be lifting the NFTs from [Rarible](https://rarible.com/), one of the most popular NFT marketplaces.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xiocm6p4gv581.png?width=1189&format=png&auto=webp&s=055accf1a28a23567ea441157e6c20a81a2a6b56

Here you can buy JPEG images of monkies, anime girls, cats, and more. But what we're after are the monkies. Some of the most sought-after NFTs. But I don't want to just save one or two of them--I want ALL of them. To be more precise, all 9,800 of them in [this collection](https://rarible.com/boredapeyachtclub).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bmjwcl64gv581.png?width=1470&format=png&auto=webp&s=493d38734dcebbf4379121389d457acd025657a4

## Installing Dependencies

I'm going to be writing this script in Node.js because I never learned a real programming language. And we're going to be using a library called Puppeteer in order to lift the NFTs. What Puppeteer does is basically starts up a remote-controlled version of Chromium that we can program to do our bidding. Let's initialize the project and install Puppeteer.

    npm init -y
    npm install puppeteer

## Writing the Script

Let's create our script. I've created a file called `index.js` and added the following:

    const puppeteer = require(""puppeteer"");
    const fs = require(""fs"");
    const path = require(""path"");
    
    const url = ""https://rarible.com/boredapeyachtclub"";
    
    (async () => {
      console.log(""Loading..."");
      const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: true });
      const page = await browser.newPage();
    
      await page.goto(url);
      await page.setViewport({
        width: 1200,
        height: 800,
      });
    });

Let's explain what's going on here. First, we're importing Puppeteer and a couple of Node.js libraries that will allow us to save files to our local machine.

Next, we're setting the URL of the page that we're going to be lifting the images from. This can be any Rarible collection page.

Finally, we're starting the browser with Puppeteer, navigating to the URL, and setting the viewport dimensions. The `await` keywords will ensure that the previous command will finish before the next one runs. This is all from the Puppeteer documentation, so it's not rocket science.

If this is all correct, then when we run the script with `node index.js`, it should open up a Chromium window and navigate to the URL.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w2vtof66gv581.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=97b194b8a2b0f4578a825adb683db661fae38000

Looks good so far. But there's more that needs to be done.

## Getting the Name of the Collection

We want to grab the name of the collection that we're downloading and create a folder to deposit all of our loot into.

We can get the name from the page title. However, it doesn't load in the name of the collection until the entire page has been loaded. So, we have to wait until the React app has been completely loaded.

I opened up the devtools and found a class name that we can hook onto. There's a div with the class of `ReactVirtualized__Grid` that is the grid that holds all the images. Once that's loaded, the name of the collection has already been loaded in the page title. All we need to do is wait for this element to load, then we can proceed.

    await page.waitForSelector("".ReactVirtualized__Grid"");
    
    const pageTitle = await page.title();
    const collection = await pageTitle.split(""-"").shift().trim();
    if (!fs.existsSync(collection)) {
      fs.mkdirSync(collection);
    }

We're using the Puppeteer method `waitForSelector` to hold off until this element is loaded. After that, we grab the page title, do a bit of JavaScript string manipulation to get the right value, and finally create the directory with Node (if it hasn't already been created).

We now have a folder to put all the images in! Let's fill it up.

## Downloading the Images

This is the meat of the script. What we want to do is get all the resources that are downloaded to the page. That includes HTML, CSS, JS, and images. We only want the images, but only the NFTs, not any logos, avatars, or other images.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fxrkbua9gv581.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e2ba767ef937d51e450d8a27f39a56cbf8c260a

If you look in the network tab of the dev tools, we can see all the images being loaded. We can also see that all of the NFTs are loaded in with a path containing `t_preview`. None of the other images on this page are from the same path. So, if we sort out these images with these URLs, we can single out the NFTs from all the noise.

    let currentImage = 1;
    
    page.on(""response"", async (response) => {
      const imageUrl = response.url();
      if (response.request().resourceType() === ""image"") {
        response.buffer().then((file) => {
          if (imageUrl.includes(""t_preview"")) {
            const fileName = imageUrl.split(""/"").pop() + "".avif"";
            const filePath = path.resolve(__dirname, collection, fileName);
            const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(filePath);
            writeStream.write(file);
            console.log(`${collection} #${currentImage} saved to ${collection}/${fileName}`);
            currentImage++;
          }
        });
      }
    });

There's a lot going on here, but we're getting all the resources, selecting the images, then only getting the ones we want. After that, we use some string manipulation to get the filename and save them as AVIF files (a next-gen image format you can learn more about [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eGN_94zbKo)). Then we're saving these to the new folder we created with some Node.js methods. Finally, we're just logging to console the image that's just been downloaded and how many images have already been downloaded.

Phew! That works, and we're finally downloading some images. But the images are being lazy-loaded. That means they aren't being loaded until you actually scroll down the page. That's great from a user perspective, as the users are only loading in images they can actually see, but not so much from ours. Let's make an function to scroll down the page for us, and click the ""Load more"" button that keeps you from seeing all the images.

## The Autoscroller

In order to start scrolling, we just want to run some JavaScript on the page to scroll it. We can do that with Puppeteer's `evaluate` method. This will run some JavaScript on the page, same as if you had written it in the dev tools console.

    async function autoScroll(page) {
      await page.evaluate(async () => {
        await new Promise((resolve) => {
          let totalHeight = 0;
          let distance = 500;
          let timer = setInterval(() => {
            let scrollHeight = document.body.scrollHeight;
            window.scrollBy(0, distance);
            totalHeight += distance;
    
            if (totalHeight >= scrollHeight) {
              clearInterval(timer);
              resolve();
            }
          }, 1000);
        });
      });
    }

What this does is jumps down on the page 500 pixels, and sets a timer to do it again every second. We're scrolling by 500px/second.  A little slow, but if I make it faster it could scroll too fast and skip saving some images. Not good. Then, with `totalHeight`, we're saving how much distance we've scrolled already and comparing it to the total height of the page, `scrollHeight`. Once we're at the bottom, we're going to stop the `setInterval` and resolve the promise. No more scrolling.

However, once we're at the bottom, we still need to click the ""Load more"" button.

We need to tell Puppeteer to run some JavaScript on the page to find all the buttons and narrow it down to the button with the text ""Load more"". There's no unique ID or class on this button, so we have to find it like this. Finally, we click on the button with help from Puppeteer. *Finally finally*, we resume the autoscroll function now that there are no more buttons to click.

    await autoScroll(page);
    
    await page.evaluate(() => {
      const elements = [...document.querySelectorAll(""button"")];
      const targetElement = elements.find((e) => e.innerText.includes(""Load more""));
      targetElement && targetElement.click();
    });
    
    await autoScroll(page);

After *all that*, we can close the browser once we've gotten to the bottom of this page containing 10,000 NFTs.

    await browser.close()

## Running the Script

That's it! We can now run the script and see if it works.

    node index.js

Actually, this will take a while because we have to scroll down and save **10,000 images**. Grab a cup of coffee or something and stretch your legs while you're waiting.

...

All right, we're back. Let's take a look at what we have here...

&#x200B;

What a haul! We now have millions of dollars worth of NFTs on our computer. Not bad for a day's work. What am I going to do with all of these monkey pictures??

[I've put the code on GitHub](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/nftgrabber) if you want to pull an NFT heist like me--or just play around with Puppeteer some more. It's pretty fun.

nhn03s,I created a free & interactive 7-hour JS course for beginners,"Hey all 👋

I just wanted to share that I have just launched a 7-hour long JavaScript course for beginners. It is completely free (not even email needed to take it).

It contains 140+ interactive Scrimba challenges, and teaches you JavaScript (+ DOM) in through building three projects.
 
You might wonder why I think we need *yet another* JavaScript course?? 

Well, let me explain... 

The reason I created this course is because I have talked with hundreds of JS beginners over the last few years, and I see a few problems arise again and again:

* Not being able to transition from *watching* JS tutorials to *building* JS projects

* Falling off the wagon because the learning curve is too steep

* Losing motivation because of boring (overly theoretical) courses

However, very few online courses take these problems seriously enough. So this course is built with these issues in mind. Thus, it is extremely interactive and project-based, has a very gentle learning curve, and spreads theory evenly out throughout the course instead of up-front.

Here are the concepts I go through:

- const & let
- strings
- numbers
- booleans
- objects
- arrays
- functions
- methods
- for loops
- logical operators
- mathematical operators
- JSON
- The Math object
- The DOM
- getElementById()
- querySelector()
- addEventListener()
- innerText
- textContent
- innerHTML
- conditional statements
- truthy vs falsy values
- template strings
- localStorage
- debugging with Google

16tqzw4,"If I was learning JS in 2023, I would 100% start from scratch with Typescript","Just finished up a work project where I had to work with an internal library written in vanilla JS...and it was the biggest pain in the ass. Even with JSDocs, there was so many issues (and bugs) such as things being undefined, nested data structures that were hard to parse, vague params that slipped through the cracks and more. It slowed down my productivity by at least 50%. 

Typescript spoils the hell out of us with how it's basically a very light version of a unit test, documenter, autocompleter, and linter all in one. I think anyone learning JS would have a much easier time if you start straight from TS, just with the basics of primitives and return typing. It'll make your life so much easier.

x9hp01,AMA - 40 y.o. bootcamp grad who ust got my first software engineer job!!!,"🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

I'll be brief, cuz it would take forever to tell it all.

I'm 40 years old and I had been teaching English for the last 8 years. In April to October of 2021 , I attended a full stack MERN hybrid bootcamp (curriculum online during the week and zoom with other students and instructors on the weekend). I taught full time during school months as well. 

I had absolutely ZERO coding experience beforehand. I had built 3 or 4 WordPress sites prior to my bootcamp only using plugins. ...I couldn't have even told you what a div or a variable was. 

In January 2022, I got serious about teaching myself how to use 3rd party APIs and I built a very simple search engine for an API using React as a single-page-application. 

Then I started applying for jobs. And heard NOTHING back. I asked a career coach at my bootcamp to help and she said to restructure my resume to show any work I had done as ""experience."" So I went from ""a teacher and bootcamp grad who has been learning for 1.5 years"" to ""Web developer - 2 years.""

That did the trick. 

After building a routine of about 200 applications a week (most were LinkedIn Quick Apply), I got in an almost instant routine of daily interviews. 

From the middle of June to the end of July, I did 40 interviews in 30 business days. I received four offers of varying quality and just accepted one for a fantastic company working with a stack I've never touched (Ruby & Rails).

If you've got the talent, the discipline, and the drive, you can do it!

ghlchs,"If you struggling with promises and failing to understand why they were created or what they are trying to solve, It might help to take a step back and learn about the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming and callbacks in JavaScript.","Javascript callbacks are one of the most important concepts to understand. I never knew the importance of understanding them until I started trying to learn Promises and Async/Await which aim to replace and solve problems with callbacks.

I had trouble understanding promises, I kept asking myself, “Where and why would I use this?”. I would read an article talking about using Promises with Fetch API I would get it in that context but I kept wondering about the situation I would create a Promise for my code.

I must mention I also had a very poor understanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, so I was set up to fail. Learning more about asynchronous programming lead me to callbacks which gave me an aha moment, the light bulb went on. I finally understood the hype about Promises and Async/Await.

In this article, We are going to take a look at the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in JavaScript. We will then proceed to learn about the importance of callbacks, creating callbacks, and finally, we will cover about callback hell.

By the end of this tutorial, you will understand:

- Synchronous and asynchronous behavior in JavaScript
- Why and when callbacks are needed
- How to create callbacks.
- Callback hell

I believe the knowledge you will gain from reading this tutorial will be an invaluable prerequisite to learning Promises and Async/Await.

12o6083,Is 37 Too Old to Land a Junior Developer Job?,"Are you feeling that time has run out to pursue your passion for coding?

Are you worried that your age might be a hindrance in landing a junior developer job?

Well, let me tell you, age is not a barrier, as long as you have the passion and the willingness to put in the hard work to learn.

In fact, being a career changer and starting your journey as a junior developer at an older age can bring a unique set of advantages that you might not even realize.

* ***Varied Background and Life Experience***: Your previous career and life experiences can be a goldmine in the tech industry. Your diverse background can give you a fresh perspective and innovative ideas that others might not have. Don't underestimate the power of your unique life experiences!
* ***Wisdom and Motivation:*** Your maturity and life experience can be a significant advantage in the workplace. You've learned valuable lessons along the way and can apply that wisdom to tackle challenges with confidence. Plus, as an older career changer, your motivation to make the most out of this new opportunity is sky-high, and that kind of drive is something employers truly value.
* ***Soft Skills***: The tech industry not only values technical skills but also soft skills. Your previous career may have honed your communication, problem-solving, and leadership skills, making you an invaluable asset to any team.

If you're passionate, don't let your age discourage you from pursuing your dreams.",191,100,No-Upstairs-2813,2023-04-16 11:53:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/12o6083/is_37_too_old_to_land_a_junior_developer_job/,0,learnjavascript

It first introduces the HTML5 canvas with demos like drawing polygons, procedural generation of images and particle physics. Then it shows how to build a simple physics engine and do basic image processing (object recognition). The course also teaches how to make more sophisticated applications like augmented reality games that use the camera and your movement as the input. The games are inspired by Doctor Strange and Spiderman and use algorithms for object recognition, physic simulations and clustering.

It seems like i try a solution only to get an error. => try another one to get another error => try another one and success! => onto the next step. And then it’s rinse and repeat until you have something that works. Sometimes I will get 10 errors before I make any real progress. Is this how everyone else learns programming/JavaScript?

gj2aex,"How do I transition careers and become an employed software developer? I’ve been working on a project-based, illustration-filled book to help people become paid programmers. It’s free to read online.","In 2012, I was stuck in a career I hated and had too much debt to go back to school.  I had never written a line of code in my life, but decided to try programming.  Fast-forward to  2014, I was a software engineer with six-figure job offers. In the years since then, many people have asked me for advice that essentially boils down to:
# _How do I get paid to learn how to code?_

This question is the inspiration for Zero To Code, a book for those seeking the fastest path to professional software development. **Zero To Code teaches you how to program through a series of real-life projects that help you build a strong GitHub profile to show potential employers.**   You can read more about the general approach [here](https://zerotocode.today).  

Zero To Code is getting close to done, and I’m ready to share it with the community. Here it is:

# [Zero to Code - Chapter Guide](https://zerotocode.today/table-of-contents)

A rough draft of the first 42 (short!) chapters is done.  I have a handful more chapters to write.

g98rvt,"Spent the last 101 days learning to code, and told no one.","Hey Reddit, this is my first post ever. Seems like a cool community so I thought I'd share my story.

I started coding January 17, 2020, I’m now 101 days in.

*An interesting side note:* In the past 100 days, I have told no one what I was doing. My friends, family, girlfriend. No one knows that I'm learning to code. So you’re actually the first.

**Learning To Code**

I wanted to document, both quantitatively and qualitatively, what it’s like to learn coding. For anyone completely new to this, I hope it helps. To any vets, *your feedback is incredibly valuable.*

To begin, I started from actual zero. I didn’t know what a <div> was, a function, loop, the difference between front-end and back-end, and honestly I think I had never used a curly brace in my entire life.

I began reading blogs, detailing people’s personal journeys with coding. The most influential, for me, outlined how she became a developer in 1 year, making several original web apps along the way. She estimated her time spent learning to code (having documented every day she actually spent learning) around 300 hours.

When I actually committed to this Project, I oscillated between “how *fast* I can learn this”, and  “how *effectively* I can learn this”, the latter was without a consideration of time (and not to be confused with how efficiently can I learn this). I created a plan, knowing well that things would change as I moved forward. In the time since starting I've more or less kept to the original concept while tweaking details along the way.

**Base Level Plan**

I determined with focused practice, 3 hours a day, every day for 100 days, I would reach the 300 goal in, more or less, three months. Getting to the bloggers (who I based much of this project around) proficiency. I reached that today. *I still have quite a bit of work to do.*

Second I determined *FOCUS* was probably the single most important variable. It seems that many people “work” or “study” for much longer hours (I believe much of which is hyperbole), and see diminishing progress.

An analogy that I like to use is, if you give a bodybuilder and a novice the same weight to work out with, will they achieve the same results (or more specifically will they achieve equal muscular stimulation?) The answer is obviously no. Rest time between sets, movement quality, heart-rate, range of motion, time spent in eccentric vs concentric are all variables in the gym. All to say that, how you use the tool (time, in this case) is equally, if not more, important than the tool itself. Reducing all of “learning to code” down to  “time spent” simply  wasn't a helpful metric alone.

So what did this mean?

* Study Sessions would be no longer than 1 hour. After which I would take between 5-15 minute break before starting the next session.
* All notifications would be turned off every device I owned. None of the tools I would use would even *have the ability to* distract me.
* Using a focus app (Forest for IOS) I would set a timer before I started a Session, and then leave my phone in the other room. This allowed me to track actually time “in-focus”
* No other tabs would be opened. If I had a question, I would simply jot it down, and move on. (This became painful later on when trying to diagnose errors, but led to more time trying to reason through and solve problems in my own code. *i.e. a super important skill*)

Focus Stopped

* If I saw that my hour was up, regardless of where I was in my lecture or in my code, I would stop.
* My focus broke. I would count this as any time my mind wandered in any way.
   * If I started thinking about problems at work.
   * What I was going to have for lunch.
   * If I was working in a coffee shop and started eavesdropping on someone else's conversation
   * If I started fiddling with things on my desk, or daydreaming of any kind.
   * If my focus extended beyond the 60 minutes (which happened on the rare occasion I truly lost track of time. Usually deep in a project) that time would count. Thus leading to the possibility of 90/60 minutes of focus or a 150% focus for that session.
   * *Side Note:* I used a screen time restriction on all social media to 8 minutes a day, across all devices. I can’t attribute this to better focus (since I didn’t also conduct this independently while having a limit of, say, 2 hours) but I think it definitely helped, at least my mental health.

**The Three Phases**

I split my learning into three distinct Phases.

Each Phase is 50 days long. Split into five, 10 days Sections.

* ***Phase 1- Learn***
   * The learning Phase was all about figuring out “The right questions” to ask.
   * There was so much (and still is so much) about this world that I don’t know or understand. Learning the fundamental concepts was the first goal.
   * With that understanding I could begin to create a mental map of the road ahead, and more importantly find better tools to help me along my way.
   * There were some hiccups here, with direction.
   * For example, I started with CSS, then HTML, then moved to JS, then React. Realized I didn’t know enough JS to learn React so went back to JS. Learned some Node and Express, then back to React.
* ***Phase 2- Practice (Where I am now)***
   * The goal of this Phase is to create as much as possible.
   * To make things, either through code alongs, prompted projects, and even personal projects and experiments.
   * One of the best tools for this was learning a new method, and then the next day (leaving a little time to forget) test myself by trying to build a small, invariably ugly little application using it.
   * Many of my apps are beyond hideous. Inelegant code, little to no styling, but every once and a while I’ll write something and just look at it thinking “Wow, that’s actually pretty badass”
* ***Phase 3- Build***
   * This is all about building big, fully functional apps.
   * Working only projects that take weeks or even months to fully see realized. This is about trying to simulate, as close as possible what it’s like to *actually* be a developer.

**Tracking**

When I started, I didn’t even know what would be important to track. So things have grown, quite a bit, since day one. I spend about 3-5 minutes updating my spreadsheets before and after my hour-long Sessions. As well as 15 minutes at night writing a summary of everything I learned that day.

Here’s a link to Phase 1 and 2 Tracking as of today! There are accompanying Google Docs with notes, and summaries of what I learned everyday.

**Tools**

Before listing out the Tools I use, I really want to warn you if you're thinking about starting on this journey. It’s not about the *specifics* of the tools. It really isn’t, and it's hard not to get caught up in that. It’s about the application of the knowledge, thats where the real learning happens.

When you JUST start out, find an instructor online that you like, and make sure the course is up to date. Those two will get you 80% of the way there. Keep moving forward, momentum is your friend.

As you’ll see below, I like Colt Steele, his style is great BUT at this point I’ve realized I need to see other people write code. So in addition to learning new material during a course, I’ll search on YouTube for the same *specific* topic that he's teaching, and watch how other people implement that technology. There are so many ways to do the same thing. Now..... tools!

**Tools**

* ***Codecademy***
   * I used the editors on here to complete HTML, CSS, JS and React.
   * This and FreeCodeCamp are where you start.
* ***FreeCodeCamp***
   * What’s nice about them is the blogs that are featured on their site.
   * I also signed up for their newsletter which features some interesting articles and quick reads to expose you to more of this world.
* ***YouTube***
   * Avoid at all costs, honestly.
   * Now obviously you’ll need to go here, but youtube is kinda like the slimy underbelly of learning to code. You go in for something that you need, but (quite literally by design) you’ll be enticed to stay, go off on tangents, and start thinking to yourself “Hmm I wonder what extensions he’s using on VS Code” or “Wow, I do need to know the top 7 tricks that ex-Facebooks used to get an interview”
   * Get it, get out. Other than that, there are a few good Youtubers, who have udemy courses. Which leads me to...
* ***The Web Developer BootCamp (Colt Steele Udemy)***
   * Great, great, great introduction to full stack web development.
   * Slightly outdated. In all honesty I cut it short when it came to the backend because almost everything they were discussing and tools they were doing needed to be modified in some way.
   * At the time I wasn’t great at reading documentation, so I ended up spending more time trying to make code compatible, than actually progressing through the course.
* ***Modern JavaScript BootCamp(Colt Steele, Steven Gridder Udemy)***
   * This was a doozy, directly after The Web Developer BootCamp. It rehashed alot of the same topics, but with new examples and updated JavaScript syntax which is nice.
* ***The Modern React BootCamp (Colt Steele, Udemy)***
   * I’m still working on this now. So far, I would give it (and plan to) 5 stars.

In addition I just bought

* ***The MERN fullstack guide (Maximilian S.,  Udemy)***
* ***CSS- The complete guide 2020 (Maximilian S., Udemy)***

Beyond this, in my notes I list specific documentation I read on a daily basis, blogs, and specific YouTube videos.

**Goals For Phase 3**

Next as you can see I’ll be working on both deepening my understanding of backend development, as well as design and CSS. Kind of seem at odds right?

***Goals***

* ***Post more on Reddit***, and get more involved in the community (timing is pretty awful, I know).
* Create projects and seek feedback from other developers.
* Have actual conversations with developers and in an attempt to uncover my blindspots, and to help tweak my trajectory.
* Publish on Github.
* Build something aesthetically pleasing (lol).

I hope this was helpful if you’re just starting out on your journey. If you have any questions for me, please feel free to reach out. I’d love to talk to someone about this, considering I haven’t in the past 100 days.",177,33,zac_solo,2020-04-27 20:31:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/g98rvt/spent_the_last_101_days_learning_to_code_and_told/,0,learnjavascript

mbrrw1,[Guide] How to use `const` instead of `let` when the initial value requires logic,"`let` is cool because it lets you define something based on calculations:

    let name;
    if (location === 'here') {
      name = 'Charles';
    } else if (location === 'there') {
      name = 'Ace';
    }

`let` is uncool because you sometimes see errors (like that `name` can be `undefined` above, when I meant for it to always be a string) and it could be accidentally overridden when it is actually meant to be treated as a constant here.

So how do I rewrite this as a constant? There are a few different solutions (and the comments go into them!), since this problem has a few particular qualities: there are only a few conditions, and it's mapping strings to strings. However, I want to provide a solution that is not limited. This is not a solution for ""simplifying a couple conditions"" or ""simplifying mapping strings to strings."" I want to provide a solution, _applicable to any `let`_, for removing the mutability of a variable that should effectively be constant. From there, you are welcome to extend into ternaries and maps as you see fit.

This solution may not be the most _optimal_ for every use case, but it is _applicable_ to every use case, and it is _extensible_ to any refactor. If you ever find yourself using `let`, you can use this pattern to replace your `let` with `const`.

The real answer is functions.

    function mapLocationToName(loc) {
      if (loc === 'here') {
        return 'Charles';
      }
      if (loc === 'there') {
        return 'Ace';
      }
      return 'Bob';
    }
    const name = mapLocationToName(location);

In this example, each _conditional assignment_ (`name = 'Value'`) is replaced with a _return statement_. The use of return statements allows multiple to exist in one function scope, without the use of temporary variables (`let`).

I use this pattern all the time, and I love it.

**Is the code longer? Yes.** Is it more readable? Yes. It is more maintainable? Yes. Is it less subject to user error? Yes. Is it easier to unit test? Yes.

    expect(mapLocationToName('here')).toBe('Charles');
    expect(mapLocationToName('there')).toBe('Ace');
    expect(mapLocationToName('everywhere')).toBe('Bob');

If you ever find yourself using `let` so that you can assign based on subsequent conditions (`if (...) { myVar = ...; }`), consider using a function to execute those conditions and return that assignment (`function abc() { if (...) { return ...; } }`).

Happy coding!",174,79,Charles_Stover,2021-03-23 23:23:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/mbrrw1/guide_how_to_use_const_instead_of_let_when_the/,0,learnjavascript

I found this survey today. It appears to be up to date. It basically says that of millions of websites that it checked, Angular, React, and Vue only have a market share of around 0.5% each. And of top 1000 websites, Angular/React/Vue only have 3.3% market share or lower.

Thing is, I hear about these frameworks all the time and I also see them mentioned in job postings. The MERN stack and the MEAN stack are terms I'm familiar with.

So my question is, why do these popular frameworks have such low market share / actual usage?",168,73,AdmiralAdama99,2020-04-14 09:39:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/g12kcw/less_than_1_of_websites_use_angular_react_or_vue/,0,learnjavascript

uf1329,JS Lessons I learned the hard way.,"So I am a more-advanced developer than I used to was and I was thinking it is time I shared some of the lessons I learned after a lot of pain and agony.

In no particular order:

* **Global Variables**

One per project. 

Never put more than one global variable on the global scope when you are doing your work. Yes, I know that

    const A = something;
    function F(x) {}

Is a lot prettier and simpler to use than

    const TheNameOfTheProject = {
      const A = something; 
      function F(x) {} 
    }

But if you do not, the day will come when you grow tired of chain-fucking yourself, because you accidentally used the same variable name in different projects; breaking both of your modules and making you look stupid in front of your boss. Or some other idiot doing the work overwrites your variables. FOR EVERY different project, only ever put one new variable or function on the global scope.

&#x200B;

* **Typescript**

Use it.

Yes, I agree that it feels excessive, but the amount of safety you obtain is unreal. While this is perfectly valid JS

    let A = [];
    A = """";

Typescript would give you angry red-squigglies in the editor; and not compile.

Furthermore, the intellisence on the editor suggests that you can't do something that you, in reality, can; requiring you to typecast before you can continue.

in JS, if what you're working with is an input element:

    document.querySelector("".someClass"").value

Is totally kosher, but typescript requires you to

    (document.querySelector("".someClass"") as HTMLInputElement).value

before it will compile. Why go through this extra, tedious step? Because debugging sucks ass. When you keep your types clean and correct, the typescript intellisense tells you EXACTLY what is legal to do off of EVERY object. As a rule of thumb, if the intellisense is yelling at you, it almost guarantees something will goof up at runtime. At the cost of 10% additional time keeping your types clean, you spend 75% less time debugging. Just use it.

&#x200B;

* **Variable Declarations**

""let"" and ""const"" only. Never use ""var"" (unless dealing in legacy code)

In Ye-olden days, ""var"" was the only way to declare a variable, but people got sick of it because of scoping issues (look up block scoping vs function scoping). Furthermore ""var"" has disturbing properties. Execute the following lines of code to see the difference

    var A = ""something"";
    console.log(A); 
    var A; 
    console.log(A);

and then execute

    let B = ""something""; 
    console.log(B); 
    let B; 
    console.log(B);

""var"" doesn't give a damn about what does or what does not exist already and is happy to just use previously designed values without care, but ""let"" does. I have lost so many hours debugging legacy code because of this important distinction.

&#x200B;

* **Object Oriented Programming.**

Learn it.

Coming in with no experience, it is actually a mind-fuck to wrap your head around, but once you do you'll never turn back. Much the same reason you should never put more than one global variable per project, you never know when some idiot is going to come behind you and overwrite what you are doing. Keep your work safe and self-contained.

&#x200B;

* **Best Practices**

People throw that phrase around a lot but don't really know what it means. The definition of best practices is: *""Whatever makes it easiest for the dipshit who has to debug your code in a few years to figure out what the fuck you were doing"".* It is particularly advantageous when *you* are said dipshit.

&#x200B;

* **Documentation**

Go fucking ham with it.

A short while ago myself and the senior developer were debugging code *that he himself wrote* twenty years ago. However? No comments, no docs, no explanations. The fix ended up simply being to remove 3 lines of code, but it took us 3 days to find it. Any documentation that it would have taken a few seconds to write was all that it would have taken to save us all that time.

edit: There is such thing as overdocumentation -- like, you don't want to read a novel for a dozen lines of code -- but it is better to be overly clear than not at all.

&#x200B;

* **Advanced Techniques**

Learn them, but be careful with how heavily you apply them.

Yes. It is really fun to flex new and cool techniques when you learn them, and one-line some code that would otherwise take 10. But as with ""best practices"", if nobody else knows what's going on then you're screwing over everyone else involved with you on the project. There is something to be said about the ""job security"" inherent in making stuff overly-fancy, but sometimes it backfires.

bzm9rt,Javascript is pretty straightforward. All the tools that surround it are overwhelming and confusing.,"I'm at the point where I'm pretty confident in a lot of what many JavaScript tutorials consider 'Advanced' JavaScript concepts.  How scope works, closure, prototypes, asynchronicity, and things of that nature.  However, when I try to get into building my own projects from scratch, I get hit with 1,000,000 tools that aren't really explained in any of the resources I've used to learn. They're referenced, and I've seen a lot of videos where they basically tell you what to write in a package.json file, but theres no real concrete explanation for how all of these things interact.

For example, I understand that Node.Js allows you to run Javascript outside of the browser, but its still required to build things that you intend to run inside of a browser?  NPM? What are packages and why do they need to be managed?

Is there a definitive guide for the above and things like Babel, Gulp, and the various dependencies I see listed in projects?

Edit: I guess I meant learning JavaScript is pretty straightforward. I’m obviously no expert, but I’ve learned enough to know it can be downright strange sometimes for sure.

Anyway, thank you guys for the advice. This has been MASSIVELY helpful.

asu0c8,"Holy shit, I did it. I created a Todo list.","For months, if not a year or longer, I've been struggling with the concept of programming with self-teaching.  I've understood basic concepts and syntax but when it comes to actually creating something and doing things on my own, I've struggled for one reason or another.  Jumping from Js to Python and back every few weeks or months, taking my time to learn and not rush.  I know HTML/CSS pretty well but I know I need to learn more so I can do the projects I want eventually. 

I finally buckled down and went to a default yesterday, going off of the advice from someone here, ""if you don't have any ideas, a 'todo' list is a good place to start.""

I was working on it for a while yesterday and today, and just got it to perform basic functionality of adding the item with a button, and removing it once the task is completed.  I haven't gotten a ""done"" list yet, but that's my next chunk of the project.

I know it's not much, and I know it seems simple as hell, but I'm so proud of myself because without tutorials or books I realized that all of the time I've taken studying and practicing basics has actually lead to practicality; I can actually use the skills I've learned and apply it to something.  It's a small, small step for me but a step that I've been looking forward to some time and my confidence has increased tenfold in the past twenty-four hours just because I know, finally, *I fucking get it*.  And it really is just as simple as doing your research in the moment. Relying on documentation, stack overflow, other code, and a lot of trial and error.

e96mn9,Becoming a professional JS developer,"

Some resources and pointers which I shared with someone considering breaking into the industry (I work professionally as a web dev in UK). Thought others might a) find it useful; or b) chip in with any big ommissions. This is targeted at an entry level junior job in UK.

Pointers


A.  There are many kinds of software development, but my focus is on web development, because it is the one with the most opportunities and flexibility professionally, probably the fastest growing, and it's the one I know best

B.  Web development = software development. Everything you used to devise for desktop computers, or even machines, can now be run entirely on the cloud, like gmail, and things have advanced to the point where people use web development languages to program non-web stuff entirely running in your desktop or your phone.

What you need to know in order to work as a professional software developer:

1. Core programming languages. It used to be that you needed one primary language for the back end (e.g. PHP, Java, Python), and JavaScript for the front end (the primary language used by web browsers). Today both browsers (what is called the web api) and JavaScript have evolved so much that you can do both the front and back end of software development in JavaScript. You also used to have to learn different languages for programming in Android (Java) and iOS (Swift) - but you can now also use JavaScript.

 This means that if I was starting today from scratch, instead of learning PHP and JavaScript to start with, I would probably focus on just learning Javascript for both the front end and back end (Node.js). That way I learn one language properly that will help me learn future languages, but which makes me employable and able to build pretty much anything.

2. Support languages/scripts: For the database (SQL is the most widely used by far, so worth focusing on first, but Mongo is often used in JavaScript heavy environments, so also worth considering). HTML and CSS for the front end.

3. Core programming tools: Git (essential for virtually every professional job); an IDE (Visual Studio Code or WebStorm); some basic unix/bash commands to interact with your machine or server. Some sort of deployment platform, like Heroku, Digital Ocean, AWS. Programming frameworks (Vue.js, Node-Express, etc).

4. Programming concepts, patterns and good practices: Object Oriented Programming is essential for most languages although it is implemented in less typical ways in JavaScript. Unit Testing. Design Patterns.

5. Configuration: of your computer, your IDE, and the tools you interact with

6. Working with (REST) APIs: the way you harness all the web technologies out there into your own application.

7. Working and collaboration practices: Using git flow to collaborate with others (and with yourself!); a basic idea of what agile working is like (very much like our action-reflection cycles), particularly scrum. Not many companies implement it properly, but most are inspired by it in some way.

8. Joining professional programming communities, primarily through meetup.com, slack and reddit.


Obviously there is a lot more. But this I think would be what a junior developer could expect to be acquainted with on a first job.  To get a brief bird's eye view of the programming environment explained with great simplicity, I found this useful: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/cddd9k/eli5_backend_technologies_and_how_they_relate_to/ettcymq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x


Resources:

To know what to learn, this is a pretty comprehensive guide. Because it is comprehensive it can be intimidating, but you don't have to learn everything there, it is just a map of what's out there. It suggests routes for three specialisations: front end (someone else looks after the data and the engine, so to speak, you focus on making things look amazing, work on mobile, be accessible, etc.); back end (you let others work on the looks, your focus is the brain of the application); and what he calls Dev Ops but is more precisely Systems Administrator (you focus on the infrastructure itself, where your app will run). The yellow highlights are a useful roadmap: https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/master/README.md

This is a great starting point as an open source JavaScript course https://www.theodinproject.com/home Follow the full stack track (mixed front and back end).

This is one of the most respected and widely used JS trainers and courses https://wesbos.com/courses/
.
Communities:

Face to face:  

https://www.meetup.com/
Look for software meetups in your locality. Free pizza, good talks, a sense of the culture of programming, and networking with a potential recommender, mentor or future employer.

hmfbo6,About to create a meta guide for junior devs,"Hi, I'm planning to build a course for junior front-end developers.

I've noticed a trend with junior colleagues where a lot of their uncertainty comes from not understanding WHY we use some tool and HOW they actually work.

My thinking is that by building a simple app in native Javascript and then in React would help in highlighting the pain points of why such technologies exist in the first place. It would include a dive into DOM and a bit of history of the web.

I'd finish it off by implementing a rudimentary react clone (in <150 lines of code) to demonstrate how it works and use that once again to recreate the original app.

I'd like to remove some of the magic out of the tech stack, peel back the curtain to show the wizard behind.

This should help the newcomers into FE overcome some of that imposter syndrome and give them enough meta knowledge to continue on their path to senior devs. I feel like understanding the wider context is paramount for the growth of an engineer into a proper craftsman.

I'm picking React because I'm most experienced with it, but the crux of what I'm trying to show is applicable for most of today's frameworks/libs.

It's a bit meta, supplementing the plethora of tutorials and courses that get newcomers up to speed to build stuff while glazing over the motivation for why.

Would you be interested in that type of content?

Can you think of some must-haves that would help you or would have helped you on your journey?",145,30,Regisk,2020-07-06 20:03:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/hmfbo6/about_to_create_a_meta_guide_for_junior_devs/,0,learnjavascript

It was mostly just untouched forks of Bootcamp homework assignments.

I taught myself JS and got hired with no relevant experience, and I was told after the fact that having code samples online made them take me more seriously than they would have otherwise.

You don't have to have an amazing personal project you've completed. If you are doing /r/dailyprogrammer challenges, or Project Euler, put your solutions in a project folder on Github. Something is better than nothing. You don't have to over-represent your skills, but you should still represent them a little bit. Personality may be enough to get you an interview and a takehome challenge, but you need code samples online to get that E for Effort, and the E also stands for Employment.

znp6wl,"""Teach me JavaScript Promises like i am a child"" i asked to ChatGPT"," it's response:

Certainly! Promises are a way to handle asynchronous tasks in JavaScript.

Imagine  you have a toy box, and inside the toy box are different toys. Some of  the toys are easy to get to, like balls or blocks. But other toys, like  puzzles or games with lots of pieces, are harder to get to because they  are buried under the other toys.

Promises  are like those harder-to-reach toys. They represent an action that is  happening in the background, while the rest of your code keeps running.  You can think of a promise as a ""placeholder"" for a value that you don't  have yet, but will have in the future.

Here's  an example: let's say you want to get a toy car from the toy box, but  it's buried under a bunch of other toys. You could ask someone to go and  get the toy car for you, and while they are doing that, you can keep  playing with the other toys. When the person comes back with the toy  car, they will give it to you and you can start playing with it.

In  JavaScript, we can use a promise to represent this action of getting  the toy car from the toy box. We can use the .then()method to tell the  promise what to do when the toy car is retrieved. Here's how it might  look:

const getToyCar = () => {

return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

setTimeout(() => {

resolve(""toy car"");

}, 1000);

});

};

getToyCar().then((toy) => {

console.log(\`I got the ${toy}!\`);

});

In  this example, the getToyCar() function returns a promise that will  resolve with the value ""toy car"" after a delay of 1 second. The  .then()method is called on the promise and logs the message ""I got the  toy car!"" to the console when the promise resolves.

Promises  are useful for handling asynchronous tasks because they allow you to  chain together multiple asynchronous actions and handle the results in a  predictable way.

I hope this  helps explain what promises are and how they work! Let me know if you  have any questions or if you would like more information.

qeacuy,Why do I have to be a full stack developer just to get employed as a junior front end developer?,"Not sure if this is the right place to even post this, but can somebody explain to me why do I have to know E V E R Y T H I N G just to land a job as a JUNIOR, I repeat, J U N I O R front-end developer? 

I applied for a JUNIOR FRONTEND developer job, and they gave me a pre-interview assignment, in which they want me to complete a FULL STACK PROJECT using databases, backend frameworks, and all kinds of back end libraries and stuff. Granted I did say I can work with node.js and express, and I can, but I am not a back end developer, and I am not applying for a back-end position, or a full stack developer position, so why do they want me to know all of this? My back-end knowledge is limited to things like setting my own server, and doing stuff like chat apps with socketio. It's not my area to know how to work with databases, and the whole bunch of frameworks and libraries that goes with it.

I am curious how do they hire backend developers? Do they just hire a bunch of junior frontend developers do their job? If I can do a full stack projects, why on earth should I be applying for a JUNIOR frontend position? Shouldn't I be just given a full stack position? And if I need to know both frontend and backend just to be hired as a JUNIOR frontend, then I can only imagine what I would have to know to be a senior. Somehow I really doubt that actual backend developers know anything about frontend development. It seems that the frontend people need to know both sides, while the backend people just the server side. 

This is so frustrating and annoying, because every time I invest time in learning something new, like React, basics of node.js and stuff, they just keep wanting more and more.

wets0v,I have just completed The Complete JavaScript Course 2022 by Jonas Schmedtmann !!!,"Wow.  I'm so proud of myself!  In January of this year I started making my way through both freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project.  I also bought this course after seeing someone recommend it.  I was progressing through TOP and fCC and doing other things until April 11th, which is the day I officially started this course.  Between then and now I have been making my way through the course and continuing on other random projects.  There have also been times where work got in the way of me doing any programming, and needing to take mental breaks and focusing on myself for a few days.

But now today I can say for the first time I have officially fully completed any JS course.  In the beginning of the course I took a lot of notes and did a lot of studying and practicing what I learned.  When I got around to the array section where I learned about array methods I stopped taking notes and decided to just code along. When I got to the forkify section I did have some difficulty.  I did understand most of the coding, but a lot of things Jonas did was confusing to me.  The biggest hurdle being, this is the first time Jonas ever used multiple JS folders to organize his code, and I had a kind of difficult time wrapping my head around why certain functions went inside certain folders, but I know with more time and practice it will make more sense to me.

Now the real fun begins. I want to start making more projects. I've tried making bigger projects in the past but always failed at them and went back to tutorials. I need to hone my skills and get better with using arrays, async, Promises, APIs and more intermediate stuff, that way I never have to go back to following a tutorial again.

I have designed many small projects already, like a calculator, BMI calculator, a todo, a weather app, a simple budget app and more, but I have never done anything bigger than that. 

If anyone has any recommendations of projects I can look into starting,  I'd love to hear them! The more challenging the better.

Apologies. I originally intended to make this post with just a few sentences but my excitement got the best of me.  I made myself my own promise and told myself that this is the last year I will ever work in retail. And now that I have completed this course, I can now work on creating a portfolio and make that promise come true for myself.",141,60,dagger-vi,2022-08-03 01:57:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/wets0v/i_have_just_completed_the_complete_javascript/,0,learnjavascript

qetwk8,Sometimes I get discouraged looking at other peoples code.,"Been working on the exercises from The Odin Project, was going great and my confidence was building after each one that passed all the tests. Then I decided to look at a solution for a project I had already completed and it completely demoralized me when I saw how simple their solutiuon was when compared to mine. Already told myself that if I had a better understanding of array methods it would be better but now I know my day is probably done as far as studying. 

Does this happen to anyone else?

Edit: went outside for a little bit and I feel better. Was thinking about some PHP I wrote last year and how horrible I thought it was when I looked at it again last month.

9wmh1k,If you're struggling with `this` keyword...,"...here is something that might help. I've been kind of obsessed with `this` lately so I'm trying to create something that will help others as well. Here it goes:

> **UPDATE:** Thank you, I didn't this was going to get such a great response! I'm compiling my notes into a series, breaking down all the necessary concepts. You can see the work in progress here:(the next part) http://jslearner.com/javascript-this-first-touch.html

Before you can understand what `this` is, and why it matters, you first have to understand what an _object_ is. Why? Because `this` **_almost_** always points to an object. The trick lies in knowing how to figure out which object it is pointing to. But, we will come to that in a little bit.

For now, imagine that you're able to shrink yourself using JavaScript magic. You're now in a JavaScript world. You're a tiny being, looking around. Every **thing** you see is an object. Some objects are naturally part of the JavaScript world. For example:

- functions
- the `window` object ( we will go deeper into that later as well)

Then, you have other objects made by developers, such as yourself. For example:

- `Person`
- `Product`
- `Account`

To start with, let's look at the objects that human beings create. We create objects because they allow us to work with data in a way that is similar to the world we live in. Objects represent the things we see and use in real life.

So, in real life, you may have an object called ""Book"". A book has a title, an author, and a cover. All these things are known as _properties_ of the book. 

We will begin with the easiest way to create an object. Later, when things get weird, we will look at some more complicated stuff.

So, the easiest way to create an object is to assign a variable to curly braces like this:

    let Person = {};

Here, we have created an empty object called `Person`. It has no traits or characteristics. Or, we could say, on a simple level, we haven't assigned any _properties_ to the object.

Let's do that - we will give the object some properties. How about giving the `Person` a name and age. Here is one way to do it:

    Person.name = ""J. P. Knight"";
    Person.age = ""127"";

So, in JavaScript, you can add a property to any object. To do that, place a dot after the object's name and then add the actual name of the property. Assign it a value using the `=` operator and you've just created a property!

	Person.hobby = ""running in circles"";

Now, you can also add properties when creating the object. Here is how that code would look.

    let Person = {
        name: ""J. P. Knight"",
        age: ""127""
    };

To quickly recap: you can create ( or _define_ ) the properties as you create your object. Or, you can add properties after you've already created the object.

> **Exercise 1**
>
> Create an object called `Account`
> When you create it, define at least three properties such as number, name, and status. Assign whatever values you see fit.
> After you're done creating your object, type
    console.log(Account);
> to see your object and its properties.
>
>
> Then, add another property using the dot notation.
>
> **Bonus points:** Create an object and call it whatever you like. Give it some properties. Then, use `console.log` to view it.

Once you do the above exercise, you're ready for the next step...

I will continue please let me know if it makes sense so far, any questions or suggestions would be great. Thanks!

ekhfmv,I will teach JS for free!," Yes, for free, it's not clickbait. Here are some things that I would like you to take note of:

1. *Background*: I have worked for a product based company for 2.5 years mainly in JS, so yeah I have a professional JS experience. By no means, I am an expert in JS and I am constantly learning new things. I have written a couple of side projects in JS and have open-sourced some of them.

2. *What is in it for you*? : Learning and connections.

3. *What's in it for me?* : Well, I am new to teaching and want to experience it so that's one. Apart from that, if you know something that I am interested in, then I am more than happy to learn that from you. I am currently interested in **Golang, Hardware (Raspi, ESP8266, Arduino, etc.), Systems Design**.

4. *Program Structure*: Fill in details in the form below and I will get back to you. The form asks you to put areas in JS that you want me to teach, so be as specific as possible. I won't be giving any assignments or snippets. But I can suggest projects that might help you understand JS better. Also, there is no certificate if you complete this course. These will mostly be **one to one sessions, live. NOT RECORDED!**

5. *Motivation*: Everybody doesn't have the money to buy a course or join a Bootcamp. I believe that knowledge shouldn't be behind paywalls. If you feel that I have helped and you feel like donating, contact me. 50% will go to charity and the other chunk will be invested to improve this program.

6. *What do I promise?* : I don't promise you a job after the course but I can promise a deeper understanding of JS.

7. *What do I expect from you before we start the program?* : I expect a basic understanding of JS (syntax, functions, DOM) and **respect for each other's time.**

At first I was quite bewildered by all the new tools: webpack, grunt, Babel... Right now I understand pretty much everything, but this post is exactly what I would have needed months ago, so in the interest of sharing and helping other oldtimers...

i56fqm,ELI5: Functions,"I was inspired to write this by an earlier post where a new developer was struggling to wrap their head around the concept of functions. (That and I also have a new keyboard, so trying to type as much as possible to get my typing speed to where it used to be.)

## The theory

A function is an agreement. It's an agreement to perform a task or a series of tasks whenever someone asks you to. The tasks are always the same, but the result can vary based on the input. That input is some value that is provided to the function when the function is being called. Not all functions have input, but some do.

## The real life example

Do you know the Happy Birthday song? Chances are you do. The birthday song is always sang the same. We agreed to sing it the same so we don't have to write a new song every time someone has a birthday. It has a title that we all recognize, it has some words that we agreed to sing, a melody we agreed to follow, and it even has an input (the person's name) that causes the result to change depending on whose birthday it is.

## The code

Let's write it down as a JavaScript function:

    function happyBirthday(person) {
        return 'Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday dear ' + person + ', Happy birthday to you!';
    }

Now we can start singing it by saying its title, which is `happyBirthday` as you can see above, and providing it with a person to insert into the verse, let's say `Bobbert`. It would look like this:

    happyBirthday('Bobbert');

The above line of code, called an invocation, will trigger the execution of the agreed upon instructions that are inside. In real life we would sing. In code it would take the name we passed in, insert it into the text of the song, and finally return the complete string:

    Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday dear Bobbert, Happy birthday to you!

## The scope

Of course, not everyone is in on the agreement. Some people have never even heard of the Happy Birthday song. If you invited them to your birthday and then the `happyBirthday('YourName');` command went out, they wouldn't know what it is. For them this agreement is outside of the scope of their knowledge.

This is probably a little bit more than is necessary for the ELI5 understanding of functions, though, so I'll leave it up to you to research it once you are comfortable with the idea of functions themselves.

Hopefully this was helpful to someone.",133,24,OldManWithAQuill,2020-08-07 03:26:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/i56fqm/eli5_functions/,0,learnjavascript

snx57z,Hi everyone! I am a noob and I learned something cool today. +Wanted to share with other noobs!,"So I was building a project that required both 'keyup' and 'blur' addEventlisteners. At first I wasn't aware you could even add multiple listeners. You totally can but I found a cool way that looks similar using array destructing.

    //here we have both events in an array. We use the array method forEach giving us back the single event then we attach that to the input I was using it on with the addEventListener
    
    ['keyup', 'blur'].forEach(event => bill.addEventListener(event, formatNumber))

This is probably insanely simple and nothing special but I got excited about it, thought it was cool, and wanted to share.

q0k7bl,"1000 hours into my learning journey...ready to quit..not sure if this is the right thing for me to be doing, anyone else relate?","I so badly do not want to be a quitter, and I know to get what you want out of life you usually have to do very hard things most people aren't willing to do if you want things most people don't have.

I have a very unimpressive resume, no education besides high school and I found coding at the beginning of 2021 as maybe a catalyst to a career where I could become SuCcEsSfUlL...

I have spent probably around 1,000 hours strictly relating to HTML, CSS, and Javascript-watching videos, working through the HTML and CSS paths of Codecademy as well as the Javascript path and about halfway through the PRO Front End developer path-alongside building mock responsive websites. 

I'm deeply questioning my path in life....I saw code as a skill you could learn that would make you marketable and allow me to live a good life-a thing that I could put my work-ethic and discipline towards and reap the rewards...but now, I am deeply questioning if I should continue..

I'm having doubts if I have the mental capacity to show up at a computer in an office/corporate setting and solve complex problems, I'm really struggling with basic JS stuff and various problems are leaving me feeling more and more dumb-currently working with Objects and solving problems with them and just feel like much isn't sticking.

I knew the path was going to be hard, and I have struggled all the way through up to this point and i'm just seriously doubting if Tech/programming is a fit for me, or if I am a fit for it...I don't want to waste anymore time :( i'm 28...

I just don't know if this is another procrastination effort where i'm just ""teaching myself"" and then never going to actually do anything with it..

Can anyone else relate to this at all?",129,82,None,2021-10-03 15:39:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/q0k7bl/1000_hours_into_my_learning_journeyready_to/,0,learnjavascript

6uwuvg,"After self-learning for a few months, I just got picked up for my first programming job.","At the beginning of 2017 I had never written a line of code. unless you count HTML when I was 15(many years ago). I work and have built a career in a completely unrelated industry, and did not complete a bachelor's degree as my work has been based on certifications and experience. This career is rewarding, but unstable by its nature and I wanted to create a 'Plan B' for myself and started learning Javascript in about March. I was also inspired after building my own keyboards (do not go if you value your wallet r/mechanicalkeyboards) to understand more about programming in general. 

Whatever the circumstance that led me to it, I started at codecademy(this was earlier this year and the new materials they just released are much better). I finished their Javascript portion and at the end felt like I had just learned to talk about javascript, and nothing about how to actually write it in a practical sense. I then found freeCodeCamp.com, they have been my primary learning source and I've completed their ""Front End Development Certificate"". This was my daily practice for the past few months - up at 6, coding for two-three hours, eat, two to three more hours of coding, then off to work in the evening, weekends included. Along with that program I took courses from Wes Bos, I high recommend his 30 days of javascript course, easy enough to follow along and even if you don't understand what is going on, you'll learn a ton. I also took a couple of courses through Stanford Lagunita, their cs101 just so I could show i'm not a luddite trying to break into the industry, and their JSON data structures mini course. I started a couple of Udemy courses but never felt the need to complete them as they were very slow, and I didn't really get that much from them, so I won't name them. Once I felt like I could write some code and build something from scratch in javascript (and react thanks to wes's great introductory course) I started to just throw my name out there, as I really need to find work. 

The process of filling out applications is just a crap shoot, I actually found a lot of education, recruitment, and placement(temp) agencies posing at companies looking for developers. They're not worth my time if they can't be up front about who they are and what they actually offer. What I found that worked to get me the position Im starting tomorrow is showing up, I went to meetups, and if I didn't get a response from a company I applied to, I stopped by. Showing up is something I'm comfortable with as I feel I present well in person and dont have the strong experience or resume I would like to. 

I watched a lot of youtube videos on finding your first developer job and the theme was clear, 'You know ~~nothing~~very little and have no experience, so your asset is passion and aptitude'. That's the theory I went with and now I'm looking forward to learning a full stack starting tomorrow! I've got so much more to learn- apollo, auth0, mongoDB, graphQL, and deeper React than i have experience with. While I'm intimidated, I actually feel really confident that if I learned this much in a few months, I can get up to speed and be useful in some way quickly. This is a small startup taking me on is a risk they are aware of, but I take it as a compliment, they have some belief in my abilities(which I in no way inflated, **Don't ever lie or inflate your abilities on a resume/application**). 

**tldr**:worked to learn from scratch, now i'm starting a developer position tomorrow.

advice- get out there, show up, be honest about your abilities *and* what you want from your first position.

edit- any advice from more experienced devs would be appreciated, I'm also happy to comment more if anyone has specific questions.",125,33,ggcadc,2017-08-20 17:03:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/6uwuvg/after_selflearning_for_a_few_months_i_just_got/,0,learnjavascript

igyjr9,Anyone who learnt JS by themselves from scratch without any programming background? Am I biting more than I can chew?,"Tl;dr I am wondering if anyone had learnt JS by themselves and become successful doing it?

I don't have a STEM background but I've worked with a lot of people who have it. I personally find them incredibly smart and I love working with them while we look for technological solutions. At some point, I wish I could do things like them.

Since I lost my job during covid, I started my little project of creating my own website. I can read python due to the nature of my past jobs, so I thought I should properly learn it and use it to create a website. I stumbled upon Djangogirls and it's kinda straightforward so I have this skeleton website. So I decided to brush my knowledge of CSS and HTML which I 'learnt' from middle school. And then now, I have to learn JavaScript. At first it was fun because i can find similarities of its syntax with python until it's not.

Everyday I try to continue learning lessons thru freecodecamp. Each day, I found myself dragging in front of my laptop. I feel frustrated especially when I try to solve algorithm problems. I would look for available answers and would feel so demotivated because there's a lot of possible solutions while I can't even type the first line. I get the idea, but I cant type the code. It's frustrating.

I thought this is wrong and I should just go back reading books while I wait for the covid to be over.

o7fbrq,Seeking people that want to work together on small projects...,"**EDIT:** Wow. We got a lot of responses! Please send me a message if you want to join (with your experience level). We are going to try this out starting this next week, and hopefully, we all should have good feedback to start the next round with different pairs!  


\-----------  


Hey, y'all! Every once in a while I see a few posts about people wanting to do pair programming. I see servers bring created on Discord so people can work together and ask questions, and similar posts...

After 2.5 years of coding, as you all know, building projects was what really helped me out. Not only tutorials, books, etc. Actually building something was the key! 👷‍♂️ All those resources are incredibly valuable, but in the end, learning to code is like learning to ride a bike: you need to get on it and try until you learn it! 🚲

So, anyone interested in building small projects with another dev? The idea is:

* two devs per project
* something that can be built in less than a week
* ideally a beginner and a ""more experienced"" dev (someone that already created a project once/ understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can relate/know how to work with API maybe?!)

After that project, we change partners. The way I see it:

1. You learn how to code
2. You learn how to work with others on a project (git is a must!)
3. Make connections

What do you think? 😃 If you like it, I would say to post here with your ""level"" (beginner/more experienced).",124,177,lucasmrl,2021-06-25 03:18:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/o7fbrq/seeking_people_that_want_to_work_together_on/,0,learnjavascript

vcc8gg,"I wrote a series of FREE JavaScript lessons! Modern, functional, with many practice exercises.","[https://intuitivejs.info/](https://intuitivejs.info/)

I've been teaching programming for many years, lately as a private mentor. I always struggled to find a resource for learning JavaScript that I could wholeheartedly recommend to students. Every website or book I found either had missing pieces, outdated concepts, verbose explanations, or a lack of exercises. So I decided to create my own. Since I was looking for free resources, it only made sense to release my lessons for free as well, otherwise I wouldn't be solving the problem.

Unlike so many JavaScript resources, the intention of these lessons is not to make you an expert in the JavaScript language particularly. The point is to learn **strong programming foundations**. JavaScript is merely the vehicle. I don't want people to be unprepared to adapt to other programming languages because they're hyper-specialized in JavaScript and all its quirks.

My students who have used these lessons have had great success and tell me they frequently go back to read them again. I hope you like them too!

>That is the hard part, and if done right can be very elegant, and if done badly can be very clumsy. My personal experience is that it requires a lot of practice to have been in all the situations where you would WISH that you did it differently, in order to do it well enough this time.

I find it the same. So how do I learn OOP? The time I had ever used OOP was only in the old days react class, and honestly it isn't really OOP.

Is OOP that useful outside the javascript world? or should I not worry it until I see a big pile of *shit* code to maintain?

f1goi5,Wakata.io: A platform I created to help my students,"tl;dr Use this to learn fullstack development: [https://wakata.io/learn](https://wakata.io/learn)

I've been working on a fullstack development learning platform for a year and a half. I developed it when I was the head instructor at a bootcamp. When I realized that my students didn't have a good fundamental understanding of programming, I started building some interactive tools to provide them with the foundation they need to succeed. This platform has made a big difference in my classroom and I hope it can help you too.  In fact, it made such an impact that I decided to quit the teaching job I loved so I can work on it full time. 

Unlike other online resources:

* You can practice and improve your reading skills, skills that are woefully lacking for most beginners
* It teaches you certain debugging skills like how to fix syntax errors and how to console.log
* It provides challenging problems
* You can learn the syntax of JavaScript at a deep level
* You can improve your HTML/CSS skills through guided exercises
* Algorithms are taught using an innovative user interface that guides the student to the solution
* You can learn ReactJS by first learning to read it and then practice building small ReactJS projects using a guided user interface
* You can practice your SQL reading skills

mlfgk3,Please help me find the best courses to learn javascript,"Hello!

So, I am in the unique position to have several months of time to get an education in a new job and I am looking to get into javascript and find a job as a programmer once I am done. The education is paid for, but I can't really find good courses on the web with a virtual classroom or something like that.

In addition, I don't want to spend my time only putting it solely in javascript courses. I asked someone and he said I should look into angular, react and vue. What else should I look into? Mysql maybe? I am pretty new to this so any information and link would be highly appreciated.

EDIT: Wow, just wow. You guys are amazing. Thank you so much for all your help and keep the good ideas coming. I am definetly going to check everything out. I did not expect to get \~50 replies within just 12 hours.

Just a few Informations in case you don't read all my replies. I am living in Europe, so any courses would need to be online and be doable in my own time. Full Time courses are out of the Question for me healthwise, so I am looking for something to do in my own time, spending around 2 hours per day during the weekdays, because I am still recovering from a long illness. I have a couple of months to spread it out to as well, so that shouldn't be too big an issue.

Thing is, I cannot just read books and free Websites. As additional Ressources - great, keep the recommendations coming. However, in the end, some kind of paid course over several months would be the best and some people have already pointed out bootcamps, so I will have a look at them.

gf6hee,From Complete Noob to Building a Platform w/ JavaScript - My Story,"So like many others, I once often found developers who shared their stories to be inspiring and help motivate me to work on my own projects. So I figured I'd share how I went from Graduating in Business Administration, to becoming a self-taught full stack web developer who launched his own platform with full-stack javascript. 

During college I was always interested in developing my own businesses/projects, but software engineering/computer science just seemed like out of the realm of possibility. By the time I graduated, I realized that I definitely wanted to launch my own business, and that the best way to do so would be to build my own tools/services/products that could actually help people. So, I started to learn HTML5 and CSS3. I had worked on different platforms/sites throughout the past (WordPress, Joomla, phpBB, vBulletin, etc.), using built-in tools to edit and modify things, but developing something from the ground up was new to me. 

So I started my journey of learning HTML and CSS by watching tutorials and taking some courses on Udemy. By the time I finished the first course, I figured I'd start applying to freelance jobs and landed my first contract. After completing the first freelancer gig, I realized I wanted to take this more seriously, and I soon realized how if I pursued it... I could build the tools and features that people really need in their lives. 

So, I tried to figure out if I should learn Python or JavaScript. I kept flip-flopping between the two. I got about 13 hours into a Python Course and I was still doing basic things like adding items to a list or removing them from a list. It was incredibly frustrating because I ""wanted to build things that I could actually see"". So I switched to JavaScript. I took a 46 hour course on Udemy, took over 60 pages of notes... and then got to the end of the course and panicked because I felt like I didn't LEARN anything. So I stopped. I felt like programming was out of my wheelhouse and I wouldn't be able to do anything with it.

Several months went by and I signed up for Treehouse. I had heard good things about it and I liked how they would reinforce learning through projects and quizzes. So I signed up and made a plan to take at least an hour or two hour each day to complete lessons/courses, and take notes at the same time. While taking the notes, I also made sure to reinforce how I could USE the examples/things I was learning in the video in real world scenarios. This parallel helped me remember things a little bit more because I would run scenarios in my head about things I could do now - which also helped motivate me to continue the class/videos. 

After completing Treehouse, the next thing was to start building a project to reinforce and tie everything together. So... when I was in school taking Entrepreneurship classes, one of the things we were constantly told when looking to start our own business was to solve pain points. Solve problems that people had. So... I looked to myself for inspiration. 

Like many of the millions around the world who are now faced with unemployment and beginning their job search once again (or for the first time during these difficult times), I struggled in my own job search years ago. I would submit my resume to employers, forward it to recruiters, attach it to job applications or job postings, and then.... I wouldn't hear back. So, I did my research like everyone always says and the two most common answers I could find and relied upon were, ""It's a numbers game,"" and ""It takes time. Job postings can be open for a month or longer before they start to review candidates.""

Well, I continued to be patient and continued to submit my resume and applications to dozens of other jobs. When it got close to the hundred mark, I began to grow frustrated. Questions began to creep in like, ""Is there something wrong with my resume?"", ""Am I including the right sections on my resume?"", ""Is it formatted properly?"", ""Is there something I can do to stand out more?""

As I began to take a deep dive in figuring out ways to improve my resume and increase my chances of securing a job interview, I soon realized that it appeared to be a common problem for many job seekers and professionals. So, several years later, I decided to build a platform from the ground up that would help job seekers and professionals identify weaknesses within their resume and give them the tools they need to build and perfect their resume on [ResumeCompass](https://www.resumecompass.co/). On ResumeCompass, we provide the most comprehensive free resume review which evaluates your resume against over 45 metrics, and a free resume builder with over 285 resume templates to choose from.

Take a look at our [Product Hunt Launch](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/resumecompass) as well!

I built the platform using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node). And I can honestly say that my journey to continue learning hasn't stopped and it can't stop in this industry. 

But hopefully, you can take something from my story and the key points which are: 1.) True learning requires dedication and a desire to increase that knowledge if only for a couple of minutes each day, 2.) Stopping and starting is fine (taking a break), as long as it's just a break and you continue on your journey, 3.) It's just that... a journey. You shouldn't expect to wake up tomorrow and know everything there is to do in the industry. We're all in different stages of our programming/developer journey, and it's ok to feel like you're so far behind, and 4.) (MOST IMPORTANTLY), You can do it! There are tens to hundreds of thousands of developers who were exactly where you are now (or even less experienced), and they were able to do it as well. 

Remember, every step forward is progress, even if it takes two steps back for you to realize you need to re-assess the next jump forward. 

I'd be happy to answer any questions any of you might have regarding my dev journey, how I built my platform that I just launched, or any other questions you might have. Thanks for taking the time to read my story, and we're all rooting you on!",107,49,ResCoCreator,2020-05-07 13:24:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/gf6hee/from_complete_noob_to_building_a_platform_w/,0,learnjavascript
bp0xnr,"My First Year of Coding Summed up in a post, so you can learn too!","Howdy Folks of Reddit ,

Not too long ago , for the first time the search bar of my browser , contained my first search for where i should learn to code.

I was making Spreadsheets with Google Sheets and discovered that if you knew Javascript , you could add more functionality to your spreadsheets!

[https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/spreadsheet-app](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/spreadsheet-app)

So i google searched where to learn Javascript , found Code Academy and begun my Journey!

&#x200B;

After a month or so i wrote my first scripts and became hooked devouring new syntax , new tips , and in general every bit of info i could find about Javascript !

&#x200B;

Around three months into my journey , i discovered Dan Schiffman / Coding train and was mystified!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM&t=208s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM&t=208s)

Here he was making cool games and other cool things with this language i was learning!

&#x200B;

I dove deep and started following along with his tutorials and making projects until i reached a point where i really started understanding the why behind what he did , so i decided i wanted to try and make my first web app !

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was in for a rude awakening , I knew nothing about HTML or CSS, I knew nothing about opening a file in the browser , I knew nothing about how to use a IDE or a text editor.

So for a month i struggled my way through Learning very basic html and DOM Manipulation until finally , my first Masterpiece was done!

[https://github.com/miaklwalker/DiceRollerMyFirstApp](https://github.com/miaklwalker/DiceRollerMyFirstApp)

Now While i was working on my app , i kept seeing git , it was everywhere.

Git this , Git that , So i decided to learn that too !

Now at this point i really started wanting to use basic es6 stuff and wanted to really learn html and css

i decided i would make my first Game!

I decided on the card game war !

It seemed like a simple enough endeavor , draw two cards , compare value bigger card wins.

How hard could it be ?

Well between multiple rewrites and a curiosity to try out typescript it took over a month to finish!

[https://github.com/miaklwalker/War-JavaScript-Card-Game](https://github.com/miaklwalker/War-JavaScript-Card-Game)

But I was proud of the result!

I was not satisfied, This was only the first bite of steak , the rest of the meal felt like it was on a plate in front of me !

I wanted to do more !

So I decided wanted to make a real game!

I choose BrickBreak!

I started building it with p5.js , but became increasingly frustrated because i didnt know how it worked under the hood.

I decided that i wouldn't use another another library or framework until everything it did just saved me typing , and wasn't just abstract!

So i rewrote the entire project from scratch!

Completely in Vanilla Javascript!

[https://github.com/miaklwalker/BrickBreaker](https://github.com/miaklwalker/BrickBreaker)

Which basically bring me to now!

I'm building my own Website

[https://github.com/miaklwalker/miaklwalker.github.io](https://github.com/miaklwalker/miaklwalker.github.io)

Very Slowly might i add haha

Building an even more complex clone game

&#x200B;

Now , if you made it this far , for what it's worth I'd like to share some of what i learned with you !

1. Always have a goal! No matter how small or large always be working towards something!
2. Keep all of your old projects ! There is no satisfaction in the world like seeing yourself get better , and

you have to have a ruler to measure with just six monthes from now your code will look like a different person wrote if you are a beginner!

3) Never be afraid to start over or google search how to do something , and never be afraid to ask for advice on how to something !

4) Don't give up , not understanding is the first step to understanding !

5) learn more than console.log , the console object has many useful methods.

6) learn to use the chrome debugger !

7) Never be ashamed of your code everyone was a beginner at some point!

&#x200B;

EDIT: I've Added a Page To my Website with links to all projects and a running version of them !

Others have raised questions like:
https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gikyb3/should_i_be_able_to_understand_the_react_codebase/

But then, if something like facebook/react is probably too complex, what is an example of a less complex codebase, which is still challenging for someone who is relatively familiar with JS?

In general, by challenging I mean:

- It has a larger codebase developed by many people.
- Most importantly, it looks like the kind of work one would do on the job (as opposed to looking like a personal project).

Would be better, if the project was relatively active.",104,15,None,2021-01-17 11:14:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/kz4oer/could_you_give_me_examples_of_open_source_js/,0,learnjavascript

The course begins with some theory about geo-positioning. It teaches how triangulation and trilateration work and how flat maps are generated from the spherical Earth. We do a simple demo where we texture a sphere using ThreeJS and create a mini 'Google Earth' like application.

Then we learn about various APIs that help when building location apps like: weather, routing, maps, etc. We then use them to build a simple app that gives navigation instructions from one point to another and tells how windy the path is.

Course ends with a series of case-studies on popular location-based apps like Waze and Pokemon Go.",104,3,gniziemazity,2020-10-15 19:18:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/jbu9ak/free_course_that_teaches_how_to_build/,0,learnjavascript

d1lf9r,Offer for mentoring,"I’m a developer working primarily in React. I am self taught but had the guidance of a friend through my early days of learning.

 I want to pay it forward. 

If you are transitioning from another career and self learning I want to help you. However I can’t help everyone. I can really only take on one person. What I will be offering is 1:1 discussions, tasks, code reviews, and direction on how to progress when “stuck”. 

I’m willing to help anyone globally but a couple things will make this easier, I speak English, and live in the pacific standard time zone. So it would makes sense if you’re also a fluent English speaker and in a relatively close time zone for logistics sake. I am willing to put 2-4 hours a week into this, I would hope you are prepared to do the same. 

Like I said I want to help someone who is switching careers, sorry if you’re not in that category. Also I think this would be best for someone who is either not yet working in the field or just starting their first developer position.

cqra30,🐕 Announcing NodeGUI and React NodeGUI - Build native desktop apps with Javascript and CSS 🎉,"We’re very excited to announce the launch of **NodeGUI** and **React NodeGUI**! 🎊

Announcement blog link: [https://blog.atulr.com/nodegui-intro/](https://blog.atulr.com/nodegui-intro/)

[NodeGUI](https://github.com/nodegui/nodegui) is an open  source library for building cross platform native desktop applications  with JavaScript and CSS like styling. NodeGui apps can run on Mac,  Windows, and Linux from a single codebase. NodeGUI is powered by Qt5 💚 which makes it CPU and memory efficient as compared to other chromium based solutions like electron.  NodeGUI supports CSS like syntax for styling (this includes actual cascading).

[React NodeGUI](https://github.com/nodegui/react-nodegui) is a react renderer for NodeGUI. This means you can create native views using React components.

**Repository links:**

* [https://github.com/nodegui/nodegui](https://github.com/nodegui/nodegui)
* [https://github.com/nodegui/react-nodegui](https://github.com/nodegui/react-nodegui)

[Cross platform calculator app built with NodeGUI](https://preview.redd.it/8ao06sdvqmg31.png?width=924&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2ee295d1a635dab8fe02377d72356493952e96e)

&#x200B;

A basic hello world app would in React NodeGUI looks like this:

    import { Renderer, View, Text, Window } from '@nodegui/react-nodegui'
    import React from 'react'
    
    const App = () => {
      return (
        <Window styleSheet={styleSheet}>
          <View id=""myroot"">
            <Text id=""mylabel"">{`Hello`}</Text>
            <Text style={'color: red;'}>{`World`}</Text>
          </View>
        </Window>
      )
    }
    
    const styleSheet = `
      #myroot {
        background-color: #009688;
        height: '100%';
        align-items: 'center';
        justify-content: 'center';
      }
      #mylabel {
        font-size: 16px;
        font-weight: bold;
      }
    `
    
    Renderer.render(<App />)

Same app without React would look like this.

&#x200B;

A basic hello world app would in pure JS/TS NodeGUI looks like this:

    const {
      QMainWindow,
      QWidget,
      QLabel,
      FlexLayout
    } = require(""@nodegui/nodegui"");
    
    const win = new QMainWindow();
    
    const centralWidget = new QWidget();
    centralWidget.setObjectName(""myroot"");
    const rootLayout = new FlexLayout();
    centralWidget.setLayout(rootLayout);
    
    const label = new QLabel();
    label.setObjectName(""mylabel"");
    label.setText(""Hello"");
    
    const label2 = new QLabel();
    label2.setText(""World"");
    label2.setInlineStyle(`
      color: red;
    `);
    
    rootLayout.addWidget(label);
    rootLayout.addWidget(label2);
    win.setCentralWidget(centralWidget);
    win.setStyleSheet(
      `
        #myroot {
          background-color: #009688;
          height: '100%';
          align-items: 'center';
          justify-content: 'center';
        }
        #mylabel {
          font-size: 16px;
          font-weight: bold;
        }
      `
    );
    win.show();
    
    (global as any).win = win;  //to prevent gc

&#x200B;

Do try it out!

NodeGui and React NodeGUI are open source projects. If you like where these projects are heading please do star🌟  the respective repos.

The code is structured for simplicity such that anyone who is willing  to contribute can get started quickly. There is also a decent  contributor’s guide which also contains links to blog posts that can get  you started even if you have no clue about nodejs addons, etc. I would  suggest you to give it a shot. If anything is unclear you can raise an  issue on the respective project repos on Github and we would be more  than happy to help. We aim to make the project easy to develop and use.  Hence, pull requests are always welcome.

If you can support the project financially 💰 please hit the  support button on the Github repo.

I hope we can build an awesome library together  ❤️ Cheers 🍺",106,17,atulanand94,2019-08-15 15:22:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/cqra30/announcing_nodegui_and_react_nodegui_build_native/,0,learnjavascript

2178y7,Learn JavaScript Properly: A New Session! Week 1 Assignments,"**Hello, world!**

Hi, everyone.  I am still finalizing the curriculum, but here are this week's assignments.  This class will be 9 or 10 weeks long (It used to be shorter, but a lot of people struggled with that).  I will put up a post every Monday listing assignments for the week. **Please start as many discussion threads as you want here.**

All assignments will be added to an [Omnibus Post linked in the /r/LearnJavaScript sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/2179b5/learn_javascript_properly_omnibus_post_for_the/).  **Please note, however, that these Monday posts are the only absolutely essential ones that you need to watch for.**

Without further ado....  Assignments time.

------------

**Required Reading:**

* Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers. You can skip the section on Bitwise operators.  Don't get too bogged down if you're having trouble figuring something out.

* [Sections 1-8 of the Codecademy JavaScript track] (http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)

Note: You should be playing around in your browser's JavaScript console and on JSfiddle as much as possible! 

------

**Administrative Stuff:**

* Do not waste hours and hours when you are stuck on one relatively small question.  Post a question here instead, and you will receive help fairly quickly, provided that you ask your question in a clear manner and provide as much detail (and a JSfiddle, when appropriate).

i0msd2,I made my first calculator!,"Hey, guys! I just want to share with you my happiness! Yesterday, I made my first calculator.

If you want, you can check it. It has its own [github repository](https://github.com/PhillJK/calculator) and [github pages](https://philljk.github.io/calculator/)

Some context. The calculator was given as exercise by fronendMasters course: Complete intro to Web Development. And I was very frustrated by this exercise, because I have never done such javascript projects on my own. It was easy for me to layout HTML elements with CSS, but I was constantly thinking about javascript part, while doing the layout.  However... somehow... I did it. I DID IT! And I'm very happy! I did my first project without hints, solution and I did not give up in the middle of the project, spent 3 or 4 hours and did it! It feels like your work finally pays off. 

Of course, there are some bugs like little bug with backspace. And you can't make calculation like:

23 + 23 + 23 

//-> 46

It happens because how the calculator works. There are two variables: number1 and number2. When you click operators (+,-,\*,/) computer saves the number on the screen to the variable number1, and when you click equal sign it saves the other number on the screen to the variable number2 and makes calculations. So if you want to get the output of the expression above, you should do like this:

23 + 23 = 46 -> 46 + 23 = 69

Why I told you all that? I don't know. I just wanted to share with someone who knows javascript and programming in general with my achievement. Yeah, I know it's small achievement, but sometimes even a small obstacle is a giant wall for someone. And also, finally, I'm not afraid of javascript, I LOVE IT!",103,20,black-eagle23,2020-07-30 14:16:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/i0msd2/i_made_my_first_calculator/,0,learnjavascript

r5n5ut,How I built a Chrome Extension with little development experience,"Half a year ago, I saw a post on r/LifeProTips ([thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/7w0uao/lpt_online_shopping_when_you_next_see_a_discount/)) with the hack of entering known promocodes for ecommerce stores. For example 10OFF, 15OFF, FREESHIP, WELCOME etc.

I saw it's automation as an excellent challenge and rolled up my sleeves. I am still in college, so I fully worked on it after school.

I don't technically study computer science, my study is actually a mix of design/user experience/coding/marketing. You could say my knowledge of Javascript was pretty beginner level.

I began by making just a basic Chrome Extension by following [a tutorial from Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHZCYi1K664). This really helped a lot to get a grip on the idea.

Another great resource for Chrome extensions is [the playlist of The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bL9VOMT65ahNEri9uqLWfS). He has a great Youtube channel and covers many topics to help get you started with Chrome extensions.

After that I made a basic flowchart of what the different steps/functions would be in the extension. This way, I could chop up the process in small tasks and complete them one by one. I do procrastinate alot, so I kept track of this whole process in [Notion](http://notion.so/) with a Kanban Board. Really great tool for if you didn't already use it!

&#x200B;

Along the way I had to learn a lot and encountered many roadblocks. Some days, the work I did was just for nothing because I ran into a dead end. I therefore had to throw it in the trash and start over. A few times I had almost given up because I didn't know how to proceed anymore. I took some breaks here and there, but then always returned with a fresh mind after a couple of weeks.

&#x200B;

This journey has had many ups- and downs, but I am really glad I proceeded with it. I've never learned so much than just by doing it. Not a single book or course gives you this much experience.

I never imagined me building the whole extension, designing the extension, programming the backend, writing copy & a lot more. It might look like a lot at first sight, but take a deep breath and take things one by one.

I hope I could pass on the inspiration to some other creators, just like how I got my inspiration from here. Just begin a project and take things one by one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

## Key takeaways:

* Use Git from the start, to rollback if you are experimenting with a new feature. After a while you don't know which single lines you edited.
* Feel free to ask on Stackoverflow, but make sure you provide enough information, and even codesnippets. And ofcourse, look for duplicate questions.
* Use a project planner like Notion, Trello or maybe even stickynotes.
* In this project planner, try to cut up processes in tasks as little as possible! This helps you not procrastinate.

*ps: if you are interested in what I made, feel free to take a look on* [*https://getluckycoupon.com*](https://getluckycoupon.com)*!*",102,16,Estasere,2021-11-30 13:21:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/r5n5ut/how_i_built_a_chrome_extension_with_little/,0,learnjavascript

ow9fob,JavaScript Interview Question: Build the SetInterval() function," I had this interview some weeks ago where I was asked to build the setInterval() function that ships with JavaScript.

While I didn't get the solution on the call, I took another shot at it after the interview and it wasn't that difficult after all - my initial issue was that I had to work with Objects and prototypes which isn't my forte when it comes to JavaScript.

After figuring out the solution, I decided to make a video about it. Even if you won't be asked to build the setInterval in your next interview, you definitely will see things like recursion, Objects, prototypes and other JavaScript concepts you are probably scared of in real life.

ldte55,Is it really worth it to learn/use TypeScript?,"Why I think it seems good to use TypeScript:

1. Typing of parameters, inputs variables lets you catch some bugs early on
2. Refactoring gets easier if you use interfaces
3. Use some language features  which are not available in JS

Why I think it seems not worth it:

1. It is a lot more work to type everything
2. The bugs you catch are minor
3. The compiled JS does not look as clean as when I wrote it
4. You can use babel to solve language feature advantage

Edit: I honestly did not think that so many people will recommend it. I will now study it and start a project with it next week. :D

For those who are like me and just started to look into TypScript - this is what I watched so far:

### Check if the argument is a Number

Below is the correct way to validate Number types in JavaScript.

```

function isNumber(n){
    return !isNaN(parseFloat(n)) && isFinite(n);
}

```


### Set default value like a pro

Want to learn a sweet way to set default values?

```

// amateurs

if(bar){
    foo = bar;
}
else {
    foo = default;
}


// legends

foo = bar || default;


```



### True sort your arrays

Have you ever had a facepalm moment when using the JavaScript sort function out-of-the-box?


```

// wrong

[3,2,1,10,4].sort(); // 1, 10, 2, 3, 4


// right

[3,2,1,10,4].sort((a,b) => a-b); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 10]



```

wr6lyp,JavaScript coding challenges for absolute beginners,"# JavaScript Coding Challenges for beginners

Mastering these coding challenges may not get you a job at google... but you'll be one step closer to understanding JavaScript.

These coding challenges are intended for beginners, therefore the solutions are implemented using only simple / classical programming elements. Each solution is acompanied by an online link that helps you quickly run it in a code playground at [codeguppy.com](https://codeguppy.com)

> Note: The code is making use of the codeguppy specific function `println()` to print the results. If you want to run these solutions outside [codeguppy.com](https://codeguppy.com), just replace `println()` with `console.log()` then run them using your browser console tool or node.js.

## Coding challenge #1: Print numbers from 1 to 10

<https://codeguppy.com/code.html?mrgCtLGA90Ozr0Otrs5Z>

```
for(var i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
{
    println(i);
}
```

## Coding challenge #2: Print the odd numbers less than 100

<https://codeguppy.com/code.html?eDLA5XPp3bPxP79H2jKT>

```
for(var i = 1; i <= 100; i += 2)
{
    println(i);
}
```


## Coding challenge #3: Print the multiplication table with 7

<https://codeguppy.com/code.html?fpnQzIhnGUUmCUZy1fyQ>

```
for(var i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
{
    var row = ""7 * "" + i + "" = "" + 7 * i;
    println(row);
}
```

## Coding challenge #4:	Print all the multiplication tables with numbers from 1 to 10

<https://codeguppy.com/code.html?78aD4mWSCzoNEVxOQ8tI>

```
for(var i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
{
    printTable(i);

i1e1go,Where to keep learning JS after freeCodeCamp?,"Aspiring  full-stack developer here. I just completed the JavaScript Algorithms  and Data Structures section of freeCodeCamp, and I'm looking for more  content to keep developing my skills in JS. I'm open to anything--  books, online courses, whatever. Preferably they'd be project-based,  though I don't need it to hold my hand too much either. I also don't mind whether it's free vs. paid. I also consider myself an intermediate when it comes to Python. I have a few questions about where to go from here:

1. Aside  from the stuff covered in freeCodeCamp, for those who are familiar with  it, what other skills should I work on when it comes to JavaScript?  What resources should I look into to develop those skills?
2. What backed language(s) should I be familiar with to succeed in getting a  job as a full-stack developer? I like Python though I'm open to trying  new things. Also, what back-end frameworks/technologies (in any  language) are most in demand? I know it varies from region, to region,  but if it helps I'm looking for stuff in the Boston/New York areas.
3. You guys must get this a lot, but I want to work at Google someday. I want to use my spare time during lockdown to make this happen.

flhj4j,You Don't Know JS Yet: Get Started (beginner opinion),"Hey guys, I am starting with web dev, just finished first certification on freeCodeCamp, I am starting the second now but I wanted some extra material to read on my phone for JS. Then I got to Eloquent JavaScript and got very frustrated with it, I think maybe because it is focused on more advanced programmers, but being honest I didn't find it very well written neither.

Then, I got to this YDKJS serie, I was adviced that it was not for beginners. But I feel this is EXACTLY was I was looking for, at least the the first book (I am on 60%, but I hope it is the same for the rest of it and the serie) is so well written and well explained, that everything makes sense. Some advanced books takes for granted a lot of things you should know but this doesn't, also, some beginner material also doesn't get very in the details, just rush explaining the surfaces of the basics things, but I think this is not good neither, for example for me, I was always making questions in my head that Kyle Simpson seems to read my mind and explain them just as they appear (He takes the time to cover the details and explain the nuances between things that seems similar!).

Right now I am using FreeCodeCamp, MDN and YDKJS and I am very happy with this sources working in combination. Just wanted to let this here so maybe it could help some other novice learner looking for resources, and my review as a novice learner of this fantastic and well written first YDKSJ book!",84,17,None,2020-03-19 20:49:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/flhj4j/you_dont_know_js_yet_get_started_beginner_opinion/,0,learnjavascript

I'm starting a 30 day JS challenge tomorrow, Sept. 14th--> [https://javascript30.com/](https://javascript30.com/)

`// Edit:I just noticed that this coding challenge already gives the solution. I'm looking for a different beginner-codeChallenge now. My proposed idea here is still valid.`

I already signed up, which you need too, if you wanna join.

The reason I'm inviting you to join me here is, because while it is nice to code something on your own, it is better to talk about what you wrote and why you wrote it the way you did and learning about the thought process of another person at the same time.

It's not about who is Mr. / Mrs. perfect, but to learn together and from each other. Reciprocity is the keypoint here.

&#x200B;

For a more effective exchange I created a private Telegram Group:

\--> [https://t.me/joinchat/AJPeMBbYz\_EWqf0DLtN3VA](https://t.me/joinchat/AJPeMBbYz_EWqf0DLtN3VA)

&#x200B;

Maybe we can even get to a point where we have meetings *(e.g. on skype or google hangouts)* at a fixed time of day to talk about what we did and step through our code together.Let's start small first and then we'll see where things could go.

Let me know what you think.",87,20,JLeeOT,2019-09-13 19:28:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/d3u9pg/im_doing_a_30_day_js_challenge_for_fun_practice/,0,learnjavascript

69nryw,"Hey /r/learnjavascript, my name's Tim and I publish free open source CC/MIT licensed courses on building products using javascript on youtube & github","Hi /r/learnjavascript!

My name's Tim and I thought you might be interested in the stuff I do.  
For the past ~9 months I've been publishing free open source courses about ""Build products with javascript"".
All materials are published absolutely free, without any ads and under permissive licenses (MIT for code, Creative Commons for videos).

The first course I did is finished and contains [11 videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_gX69xPLi-ljVdNhspjZUlPmBNjRgD2X) that go through the process of creating the client-server application using javascript (node.js, react, webpack, that kind of stuff).  
Those videos cover all the process of creating the app:

 - figuring out the idea,
 - setting up a project with git,
 - picking a database,
 - using docker for development and deployment,
 - building REST API,
 - building web app client for that API with React/webpack/etc,
 - unit testing all that,
 - and finally - (continuously) deploying it with docker.

Additionally, per request of some viewers, I livestreamed the process of development that preceded the explanatory videos.  
There are [13 livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_gX69xPLi-nM52i7LyeEo8Rpu9t_s9tV) that cover most of the explanatory video I did.

The second course is currently in progress - I am [building an Electron.js desktop app](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_gX69xPLi-lBH8I52J-3nEhEQD6_nDs6) that streams videos from multiple sources (think Kodi, but in JS).  
Currently working on Crunchyroll integration with more following after I'm done with this.  
As for the first course - I'm also doing [livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_gX69xPLi-nFjI1x4beXHY2wRjIqZmwC) if you are interested in more detailed look into coding such things.

I am generally happy to answer any questions you might have about the stuff I publish (or just javascript), so feel free to ask here, or on [our cozy Discord server](https://discord.gg/hnKCXqQ).

Hope some of you will find this info interesting.  
Have an awesome weekend! :D

joaq8j,Well I finally understand closures enough to actually use it,"I can't tell you how many articles and videos I've read/watched on closures.  See, it's easy for me to sort of gloss over things like execution context, call stacks, and scope because it all seems pretty obvious and I felt like I understood them perfectly fine.  But honestly, I really didn't.  Not enough to take them into account while I'm writing code.  Knowing the fundamentals is significant if you want to use closures.  In fact, knowing the fundamentals well enough will actually help you even *think* of using a closure.  Anyway, I don't know how the JS community thinks about closures, but I'm just glad that I got it because it was driving me crazy.  What else drove me up the wall were Promises and async/await but I think I pretty much got that too.  It's not that I couldn't understand the concept of Promises and async/await, it's just if I'm reading other people's code, it starts to get a little cloudy for me and I have to *really* think about it.  Javascript is a pretty difficult language to learn (and ESP master), at least for me.

If you're interested in knowing what exactly I was doing that made it click for me was Jonas Schmectmann's Udemy course on Javascript. It's pretty good since Jonas doesn't miss a beat. Maxmillian and Traversy are also probably great options since I've watched quite a bit of their youtube videos.  Apparently, Colt Steele is good as well.  However, articles on Medium and similar blogs are great too if you're really struggling to learn some of the concepts.  Best of luck! Oh, and how I came to understand Promises and async/await a lot better was actually from playing with it in my code.  For example, console logging Promise, Promise.resolve(), Promise.reject(), or deliberately not calling resolve or reject and seeing what exactly is returned (which is a Promise that will always be pending IIRC).   I hope my post will be of some use to anyone struggling as I've been.",84,22,Aggressive-Pickle91,2020-11-05 02:43:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/joaq8j/well_i_finally_understand_closures_enough_to/,0,learnjavascript

I get frustrated for days every time I have to learn another one of these stupid build tools. I've been using webpack a week and while i was using the devserver (someone else set up) life was great, but I've been trying to build a bundle for production for like 3 days now. I've tripple checked my code scoured stackoverflow and ,my days of failure are making me feel inadequate. I wish I could just install webpack, say do the thing, it auto detects what kind of files i'm using and uses its brain to say ""hey this seems like jsx since the file name ends in .jsx"" and it just does its damn job. maybe it could see a ...Object.spread operator and it could think to itself ""hmm why are they using webpack in the first place, probably because they want to use es6 features"". I know for one reason or another I'm wrong, whatever I'll try again tomorrow. I just wanted to learn redux and set up a working boilerplate so I can avoid looking at my Webpack.config / Gulpfile for another year.

i7chwt,I love javascript but I hate css. A question about front-end.,"When people use the term front-end, how much time out of someone's work day is spent on styling pages compared other development tasks.

It's not a matter of difficulty, styling things is just not something I enjoy. I've learned a fair bit of python, and have made several flask applications now (including one that I developed for work that is finding a lot of use!). I've been using bootstrap to make things look nice enough. 

I really want to continue making web applications and so I've started to study javascript (and I'm LOVING it). For anyone familiar with the curriculum, I've been going through the Odin Project on the side and have completed their 'Web Development 101"" section, and am midway through their javascript section. Looking ahead, I see they have a full section for html and css. I'm going to do it for the experience, it just doesn't hold the same magic as actual programming does for me.

This begs the question, should I avoid front-end positions when I feel comfortable enough to start applying for development jobs one day? And how many other people on this sub are learning javascript with aspirations to be front end developers in particular?",84,65,ExtraSpontaneousG,2020-08-10 20:09:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/i7chwt/i_love_javascript_but_i_hate_css_a_question_about/,0,learnjavascript
hvfapo,Web Developer Job Advice- does this seem right?,"Hey y’all! I am in need of some developer job advice... not code! Maybe it can help other people too?

I have been studying JavaScript for 8 months now. At first about 8 hours a day to be honest.

I actually got a few jobs freelancing and it felt great. All the jobs went well - even when it seemed like it was out of my league. Projects are completed and the clients are happy!

What’s weird is that it’s going so well that these people want me to keep working on new projects- but now they want me to hire a jr developer and have suddenly started calling me the sr developer. 

I was completely honest with them up front that I am new to the web dev world and my experience rested in only a few jobs. 

Am I crazy to be a little worried about the direction and speed this is going considering my lack of years of experience? It makes me feel un-easy working with people who consider me to be more qualified than I am, even though I told them the truth.

After feeling like I've not learned a whole lot with Colt Steele's Udemy course, I decided to give the Odin project a go. However, I am getting completely stuck at the assignments and feel like you kind of get thrown into the deep from the start. It's very demotivating and had me doubting a lot.

I have decided to follow the curriculum at freecodecamp for now, and I quite enjoy it, but was wondering if there's any other online resources that you guys could recommend that'd compliment this course. Also, how did you like fcc?

The reason I didn't learn extremely much on Udemy is because the course holds your hand a bit too much and you only really see one approach to coding--It's fun, sure, but I want to figure things out a bit more on my own, yet the Odin project is a bit too extreme (for me) in that sense.",85,40,retrocatman,2021-04-21 06:55:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/mva3si/what_compliments_freecodecamporg/,0,learnjavascript

7jtxx5,Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp - An in-depth review,"Today I finally completed [Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)

This course has been widely recommended on reddit for web development. So here is my 2¢ about this course. 

**My background** - I have 2 years of experience in web development. I developed mostly static websites (HTML, CSS with framework such as BootStrap) and WordPress websites. I had a basic knowledge of PHP and MySQL. But no clue about MVC architecture, back-end frameworks etc. 

I purchased this course in November as I wanted to improve my skill sets and advance my career.  I always wanted to teach myself nodeJS and back-end web development, but I did not find any beginner friendly course. I could only afford to learn online on sites such as Udemy due to very low and affordable course fees. I paid $10 for this course. 

Initial thoughts - As I went through the course contents, I regretted that I should have taken this course at least a year ago which would have done wonders for my career. 

The curriculum is well structured to give a dose of full stack development to a beginner. 

Initial Front End Development was a refresher. I knew many of the concepts beforehand. 

**HTML** - Colt does a great job covering commonly used HTML tags. He refers to MDN Docs as well quite early in the course as a reference material. Overall this is a small section which gets completed soon. 

**CSS** - Colt skimmed through CSS section. I agree that there is lot of ground to cover in CSS. He did a nice job explaining about Specificity and Cascade, Selectors, Fonts etc. There were 2 projects to give a practical experience in writing CSS. He was very vocal about 'Separation of Concerns' viz maintaining separate stylesheets (and later scripts) and discouraging practice such as inline css. 

Biggest letdown was concepts such as Positioning and Media Queries weren't included nor explained in great detail.  

PS: I guess Colt has included advanced css concepts such as flexbox, animations etc in his Advanced Course which is sequel of this course. 

**Bootstrap** - This is a huge section where he explains about various Bootstrap(version 3) components such as navs, grids, forms. There is a image gallery project using Bootstrap which was cool. 

Overall in Front-End Development I feel Colt doesn't emphasize on UI (which is a recurring theme in later part of the course).  UI is probably not his forte. Stylesheets for various projects were quite slim throughout the course. 

**Javascript** - JS lessons were very good. Syntax, Control Flow, Functions, Arrays, Object Basics were taught in great detail. (Almost 8 hrs content in 40 hrs course). This is mainly because whole backend section rests on JS foundations taught in these sections. There are various tiny coding exercises and quiz to hammer home the JS concepts. 

**DOM Manipulation** - This was very good and most interesting part of the course. DOM manipulation was taught using vannila JS with methods such as querySelector, querySelectorALL, addEventListner etc.  

I thoroughly enjoyed Color Game Project which was about guessing the right color from RGB Color Code.  

**jQuery** - Colt begins this section with a caution about jQuery, how it was popular once, current status, strong opinions for/against jQuery in the developer community etc. He also adds that things which can be done using jQuery can be done using vanilla js as well (That's why DOM manipulation section was earlier in the course). 

We build a cool TODO App using Jquery which was fun.

**Optional Project  - Patatap Clone** - This is to primarily teach using various libraries in the project (paper.js and howler.js in this example).

This officially completes the front end portion of the course.  
 
**Backend** - Colt teaches backend technologies in great detail, sometimes it gets repetitive but great for practice and cementing the concepts. 

Colt uses Cloud9 for backend sections, and it begins with a introduction to command line and basic linux commands. 

I wanted more real-world scenario for myself with setting up of development environment etc.  So i used my local machine (ubuntu 16.04) for this portion of the course. I was already familiar with command line interface. 

Colt calls our backend stack as MEN stack. M for MongoDB, E for Express, N for Node. There is no front end framework here such as Angular or React. Front end libraries are imported in script tags in conventional way. 

**Node** - Introduction to REPL, quick exercises, npm, installing packages etc. npm faker exercise was fun. 

**Express** -  This begins with a simple express app, package json file, route params, basic exercise. Colt uses 'ejs' or embedded JavaScript to render view templates.  

**Movie API project** - This is a small project which teaches how to work with APIs (OMDB API in this), handling JSON response etc. I wish Colt could have expanded this section with more projects such as weather api, google maps api etc. 

**Main Project - YelpCamp** - A review site for campgrounds. 

YelpCamp is Colt's flagship project for this course. It aims to teach integration of front end and back end to make a full fledged application with CRUD functionalities using Database, REST APIS, Authentication etc.

**Database (MongoDB and Mongoose)** - Colt gives a brief introduction to MongoDB, Mongo Shell and Mongoose connection  etc. Further he talks about how to integrate mongdb with yelpcamp (Data Persistence) to create various campgrounds, users, comments etc. 

**RESTful Routing** - Colt teaches about RESTful Routes by building a fully functional Blog app with CRUD. He also uses a different framework called Semantic UI instead of Bootstrap. 

**Data Association, Creating Comments**  - Here colt teaches about data association concepts such as embedded data, object references and using the same concepts to create comment feedbacks for campgrounds. 

**Authentication** - Most important section where Colt teaches how to add users to yelpcamp with proper authentication. Rather than creating our own authentication system, Colt uses passport.js for the same. Here we learn about various aspects of passport such as configuration,  local strategy, plugging passport to our model. 

Our app by now looks pretty cool. New users are able sign up, login , create campgrounds etc. Finally CRUD functionality is completed for campgrounds and comments.

Last part of this course is adding flash messages for better error handling especially during authentication. This is followed by git basics and deploying to heroku

By this time we have spent a huge amount of time on this course (about 40 hrs). I think Colt got bored about the course and did not update further. Many functionalities which Colt said will be present in the YelpCamp is missing such as rating campgrounds, sidebar completion, google maps, user profiles, admin roles etc. His teaching assistant Ian has created a resources section with few slides with some of these functionalities in form of mini tutorials, links to youtube videos (some created by Ian, some by other developers). I guess we need to do them at our own interest. I skipped most of it. 

There is an additional part by an instructor called Ellie who teaches about intermediate javascript concepts such as this, call, bind, apply, OOP in Javascript, closures etc. It is not related to YelpCamp and is a standalone section. 

Overall, you end up with sufficient knowledge to build a small web app with CRUD functionality with Data Association and Authentication. This course gives us good foundation to modern JS development.

I wish I had found this course earlier in my coding journey. I wandered too much through beginner tutorial wonderland with half assed attempt in learning ROR, Laravel etc. I tried many things including TheOdinProject, FreeCodeCamp I always used to get overwhelmed. Completing this course has boosted my confidence and I have found my peace in JS development. I want to continue learning JS frameworks.    

Here is my [final YelpCamp app](https://murmuring-river-39588.herokuapp.com/) built as a code-along in this course. 

**Next Steps** - I have bought [Colt's Advanced Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-advanced-web-developer-bootcamp/) which aims to teach CSS animations, Flexbox, AJAX, Unit Testing, ES6 , D3, React and Redux. This looks promising and I am hoping to start this soon.  

Wes Bos courses looks promising as well. I also got a great deal for [Wes Bos courses](http://wesbos.com/courses) during black friday ($20 per course due to regional pricing). I completed a few lessons in JS30 and ES6 course. Wes uses ES6 syntax in all of his courses which is awesome and sometimes seems like a magic ( Arrow Functions, Template Strings, ...Spread operator etc).  Wes and Colt have similar course content. Wes has got great CSS tricks up his sleeve along with awesome JS skills.

TL;DR - Highly recommended Full Stack Web Development Course with Beginner Friendly step by step teaching which gives you good foundation modern web development with Javascript.

e09twh,The Hero’s Journey of Coding,"See full post with images: [https://loopinput.com/the-heros-journey-of-coding/](https://loopinput.com/the-heros-journey-of-coding/)

Almost universally learning to code is hard. It is hard and it is frustrating. Resources to go from 0 to 1 as a beginner are easy to find but figuring out the path from 0 to mastery are not.

The modern coding environment only complicates this as more and more options, tools, frameworks, and potential paths are invented. These options are designed to make coding more manageable, but for a beginner can be overwhelming.

My goal here is to lay out a clear, structured path from 0 to mastery I call “The Hero’s Journey of Coding.” The Hero’s Journey is hard. The Hero’s Journey will be frustrating and will feel hopeless at times. But the Hero’s Journey works.

I heavily based the strategy on research from Cal Newport (computer science professor at Georgetown University) and Barbara Oakley (professor of engineering at Oakland University), as well as on a large body of research into learning, and more specifically, learning technical subjects.

Learning to code is a non-linear process and forcing a strictly linear structure on it will slow your learning process. It is analogous to learning a language.

Two hypothetical people start studying Mandarin at the same time with no prior knowledge of the language. One begins a course that promises mastery of the language by the end of the course. The other takes the same course… but supplements it with reading books in Mandarin, watching shows in Mandarin on Netflix, speaking to Mandarin-speaking people in his or her area every day, listening to the news in Mandarin, listening to podcasts in Mandarin, memorizing Mandarin grammar structures and vocabulary words, switching to the Chinese servers in the online games they play, asking about aspects of the language that confuse them in Mandarin language forums etc.

Because the second person is varying their types, contexts, and methods of learning, they will learn Mandarin surprisingly faster than the first person while preventing burnout by altering the kind of cognitive load they place on their brain.

Additionally, since the gains are cumulative, the second person will exponentially approach mastery faster. This approach is backed by research. If you want to look into it further, Harvard has an excellent compilation of research into the topic here: [https://bsc.harvard.edu/study-tips-guides](https://bsc.harvard.edu/study-tips-guides)

Differing your types and content of learning also promotes neurogenesis (production of new neurons in the brain). Here is a study on the fact: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3445739/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3445739/). The other thing proven to increase neurogenesis, by the way, is exercise (specifically aerobic exercise). The same study linked covers that topic as well if you are interested.

In this guide, I’ve put together the findings of this research into an actionable sequence I call “The Hero’s Journey of Coding.”

Some parts of this guide, particularly towards the end, will upset people and may be construed as overwhelming or discouraging towards beginners.

I’ve purposely constructed this guide to be the antithesis of the other guides I’ve read (and I’ve read hundreds) which have been too vague, too introductory, and too afraid to get into the nitty-gritty of how the actual process usually looks.

What I lay is not the only way to learn, but it is a research-backed, experientially backed, and effective way to learn. Here I offer the gory details of the whole process, so I hope you are ready.

The Call to Adventure: A Guided Introduction

The first step in the hero’s journey is a guided introduction. Before a hero can pursue his core quest, he must learn the ropes. This most often comes in the form of a course, often a video course.

You are going to want to find a long-form introductory course (minimum should be 40 hours). You can start by going to Udemy and sorting by duration ([https://www.udemy.com/topic/javascript/?duration=extraLong&sort=popularity](https://www.udemy.com/topic/javascript/?duration=extraLong&sort=popularity)). Other popular alternatives are the Odin Project ([https://www.theodinproject.com/](https://www.theodinproject.com/)) or Code Academy ([https://www.codecademy.com/](https://www.codecademy.com/)).

Two instructors I personally like are ([https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/)) and ([https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/)). But make no mistake, this course is just going to give you the shallowest feel for what you are about to pursue.

You will begin to get the breadth of what you need to learn. You will start to know the tools, frameworks, terminologies, and places to look for knowledge.

Don’t worry too much about the language or frameworks that you start with as long as they fit your end goals and are popular. Coding languages are not like spoken languages; once you know one in-depth, you can pick up others fairly quickly. So the language you start with will not doom you down the line if it falls out of popularity. Also, as you become more knowledgeable, you can make a switch if necessary.

Don’t fall prey to language and framework “paralysis by analysis” and instead do a week’s worth of research and then dive in and commit at this stage to the course, language, and framework you have chosen. Finish the entire thing from start to finish.

Other alternatives to a video course are classes or boot camps if that is more your style. If you went to school for something like computer science or have the equivalent experience already, you can skip this step entirely.

Think of the guided introduction as defeating the low-level beasts you need to get from level 1 to level 10. Make no mistake, some of these “low-level beasts” will be formidable.

In fact, the low-level beasts are often a more significant obstacle than the higher level beasts that will come along later because your skills will scale up faster than your enemies.

You are going to need a little help. It’s time to consult the oracle.

Supernatural Aid: Consult the Oracle

Who is the oracle? The oracle is known by the mystical name “Google.” You can ask the oracle anything, but you need to ask it the right way.

As you ask the oracle more questions, you will get better and better at divining answers from her mystical responses, which may often lack context and appear unusual. Often answers will appear in coding forums like Stack Overflow ([https://stackoverflow.com/](https://stackoverflow.com/)).

Sometimes you will find out your question has already been asked and the answer is already available. At other times, you will find out that you must ask the question yourself.

As you go further along, you will never stop Googling but the answers to your questions will more rarely appear as they get more technically complex and more specific.

The Vision Quest: Your Core Quest:

You cannot keep dispatching low-level beasties forever. You need to pursue your core quest. Your core quest is a project which you continually build on and improve as you learn more.

The core quest should start as soon as the guided introduction is finished. You need to learn how all the concepts tie together and work in the real world. The less like a simulation and the more like your end goal the core quest is, the better.

The core quest will start out humble but will develop into a save the world scenario. The core quest is what you never lose focus on and is the most crucial part of the journey. All the other parts of the journey are to supplement the core quest.

The core quest is from where the glory and victory in the Hero’s Journey comes from.

Descent Into the Underworld: Do Battle

As you pursue your core quest, you must do battle with great foes to improve your skills. These foes come in the form of coding challenges from sites like leetcode ([https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)), codewars ([https://www.codewars.com/](https://www.codewars.com/)), or hackerrank ([https://www.hackerrank.com/](https://www.hackerrank.com/)).

Coding challenges are a different kind of coding than your core quest or guided introduction. You want to pursue different types of knowledge paths so you don’t burn out doing the same kind of learning. Remember, research indicates that diversifying your learning strategy exponentially improves your path to mastery.

Start with the most manageable problems and eventually try to work your way up to the hardest ones. Try to make it a goal to do every single problem in the site in your chosen language if possible.

The Master of Two Worlds: Learn from the Masters

As you slay great enemies, you will feel the need to go more in-depth in specific subcategories of battle. This is where you consult the masters.

The masters have created great tomes for you to pore through. Using Javascript as an example, start with the thinner tomes ([https://eloquentjavascript.net/](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)) and work your way up to the great towering tomes ([https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FK9VBD7/?ie=UTF8&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FK9VBD7/?ie=UTF8&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0)).

This does not come after your core quest or doing battle but is interspersed between. As you pursue your core quest and do great battles with enemies, you will need to take breaks to regenerate and refresh yourself. That is when you read these great tomes.

Ascension, Apotheosis, and Atonement: Arcane Knowledge

The tomes will give you great knowledge but you will find yourself thirsting for the more arcane and specific knowledge. This is the last part of the coder’s journey.

The arcane knowledge is the documentation itself. This is the raw, unfiltered, incantations. You will learn sick and unnatural abilities from these arcane sources. Start out by reading the documentation as a reference point beginning with the core quest but the spells and incantations are brief and specific, and so, should eventually be memorized.

The documentation itself is usually brief enough to be fully digested overtime. I suggest turning the entire documentation for the tools, frameworks, and languages you use into online flashcards using something like quizlets ([https://quizlet.com](https://quizlet.com/)) and gradually memorizing them.

So, for example, if you are a web developer using MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js that would include the entire mdn docs ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)), MongoDB docs ([https://docs.mongodb.com/](https://docs.mongodb.com/)), Express docs ([https://expressjs.com/en/api.html](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)), and Node.js docs ([https://nodejs.org/en/docs/](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)). It would also include any tools you use like Bootstrap ([https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/overview/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/overview/)) or Mongoose ([https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html)). If you use it and it has docs, include it.

This may seem overwhelming, but you would be doing this over a long, long period of time and piece by piece. Evidence that this strategy is effective: [https://bsc.harvard.edu/files/smarter\_studying\_8-10-16.pdf](https://bsc.harvard.edu/files/smarter_studying_8-10-16.pdf)

Having the documentation memorized is a sick and powerful ability. This is the most grueling, controversial, and formidable-sounding part of the hero’s journey, which is why I saved for last.

This comes after you have slain your great foes and have completed most of the journey and are searching for that last, last edge to push you over the top into glory.

Go forth, hero, and find your glory.

dynhmv,LOGIC of Tic Tac Toe with simple AI in JavaScript for Beginners,"Tic-tac-toe for American English, noughts and crosses for British English, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns filling the spaces in a 3×3 grid (2D Array in JavaScript). The player who succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

&#x200B;

For the tutorial and like always, I'm going to start with the logic part, and after we understand that, then I will open the text editor and try the build the game from scratch.

&#x200B;

This JavaScript Project may seems easy to build, but trust me there a lot of things to learn though.

&#x200B;

Anyone with JavaScript Basics (For loops, variables, functions, Arrays, if statements ... etc) can build this game.

&#x200B;

I will start the tutorial with a preview of the Tic Tac Toe game, and then talk a little bit about the canvas, how to draw on the canvas, and what does the method getContext() do.

Then we will talk about the HTML elements we're going to need for our game.

&#x200B;

For JavaScript, we will need to files options.js and game.js they are self explanatory.

OPTIONS.JS is where the code that handles the player's options lives, like what is the opponent and symbol it has chosen.

GAME.JS is where our game code lives.

&#x200B;

This is Just the first part of tutorial, there still is a second part where we're going to discuss the AI.

You can find the second part here: ""Sorry not uploaded yet :(""

&#x200B;

In general in our game.js all what we need to do, is:

&#x200B;

1. A 1D Array called ""gameData"" to store the players moves.

2. Draw the board on the canvas.

3. add Event listener to the CANVAS.

4. Determine which SPACE on THE BOARD the player has clicked on.

5. Update the gameData array. (if the space clicked by the player is empty)

6. Draw the player's move on the board (canvas).

7. check if this player wins. if wins we show the game over message. and stop the game.

8. If it doesn't win, we check for a tie game, if it's a tie we show the game over message. and stop the game.

9. If there is no winner and it's not a tie game, we give the turn to other player.

&#x200B;

I don't really have a question or anything but I just want to thank you all for being such a helpful community. The last few months you might've seen some questions about a recipe app and working with API's, those came from me because I had to make an app for a class this semester without any knowledge of javascript. 

With the help of this community I managed to make a complete recipe app using a database and localstorage to (hopefully) pass for that class this semester. I'm pretty much done with it all I need to do is some styling.

bx3fgr,Today's interview questions,"So I'm still on the interview streak I guess, now will cry less and directly jump into content.

1) What is Redux Saga? ( yeah that was first question lol)
- I said I don't know much but know about redux thunk so explained that

2) What new features did HTML 5 bring in? 
- I got blank! then he said have you heard of Semantic tags I was still blank, 

3) What is CSS Box Model?
- Explained the whole how a element has Content->Padding->Border->margin structure
then he asked giving an example with 

```
<div>A</div>,
<div>B</div>,
<div>C</div> 
```
then why would B stick to left most part of the browser display, I explained that if we give it margin it will just move away from the left most part of the screen as well as the top and bottom div elements. 

but then the confusion was created that how can that happen?

4) what are the different values you can give to position?
- I could only recall absolute, relative

5) what are the different values one can give to display?
- I could recall none, in-line, block, flex

then he brought in that A, B, C example again saying what will happen to B if we have it position `relative` I explained that it might overlap to the previous and set itself according to A's position 

then question: what if we give in-line and in-line block what will happen, explained that in-line will put those elements in a row where as block will create a block that extend the whole width of that element.


Now coming to *javascript*
6) 

```
console.log(a, b, c, d);

var a = 10;
let b = 5;
function(c){return 15;};
var d = function(){return 20;};
```

I said a will output undefined, because of hoisting only variable declaration gets hoisted not the initialization,

b will throw some error (which I don't know) but let keyword doesn't hoist

c I was unsure

d I said same as a it will hoist that it is a function but not the execution and will just say undefined.

but he said no you are wrong for c and d, I couldn't explained and got blank

7) 

```
var a = {
   x: 'something',
   y: 'technology',
};

var b = a;
var c = b.y;
var d = c;
a.y='discussion';

console.log(a, b, c, d);
```

I said a will print out the object with updated value, 
b will print out object with old values
c will be 'technology' since the old values
and I was again unsure about d but said it will be same as c 

and the MAJOR LONG CONFUSION begins,

I explained that b will have a's initialized state values but not the complete copy it will be pointing to a. 
he asked, like why do we need such code design ? What made it evolve into something like this? and what benefit does it give us? 

I was blank again but tried to explain in a way saying that when we want the old prototypes to be hold by the assignment and only use them while the particular object might get mutated later on in the code/procedure, so this one helps to resolve those kind of code design. 

And he kept asking those questions for few minutes. 

8) what is local storage? 
what is session storage?
what are cookies?

I explained the local storage that browser holds one object which we can access by get and set. But said session storage depends on our backend and how we write then on his notice I corrected that it is client side.

then he asked can we delete/remove/destroy local-storage, or where does it get deleted? Noob, I said, it gets removed upon page refreshed?

but then the cookies came and I said that whenever webpage loads it also stores some values in terms of object in browser's storage which can later be manipulated by the webpage's interactivity? but then he kept asking what are cookies? 

and I got confused!!! 

**Learnings**: Never need to give doubt myself.
though thinking of leaving Javascript now. 

please someone motivate because from last interview's pub-sub implementation question to someone dominant keep asking his list of question my life dangles. 

My another tech lead said the other day people take interviews as people in company need someone who is higher then them. So don't know where I'm going wrong.

**My worries**: I have not worked on any project since last 2 months. I want to do more projects build more stuff, with react, react native, even yet to learn React Hooks, I don't know when will all that happen?",81,52,tapu_buoy,2019-06-05 14:50:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/bx3fgr/todays_interview_questions/,0,learnjavascript

q5zv4r,Feeling like you know javascript until you read other peoples code,"I've been learning javascript fulltime for 6 months. I've got experience with vanilla javascript, react, testing and typescript. I can pretty much build anything I want and I feel like I'm ready to start applying for jobs soon. However, I often come on this subreddit and see a question posted by someone that makes me feel like I know nothing.

It oftens seems that someone has a problem with their code where they're trying to create their own 'for loop' instead of just using a method like .map /.forEach or .filter etc. There will be no information about what they're trying to achieve with the function or any wider context. The name of the function doesn't give a hint, and the variables are usually just single letters. To me it just looks like a convoluted mess that I can't work out. Yet someone comes along and solves the problem in one sentence. Then I feel like I actually know nothing.

I'll go onto stackoverflow and try to answer some react questions. I'll find a question that's being asked by a relatively new developer, yet when I look at their code, once again it's convoluted and they're writing class based components in 2021. I think why the fuck is this person writing class based components and wtf are they trying to build? Yet once again, someone comes along and answers their questions in one sentence. Then I feel like I actually know nothing again. 

Does anyone else feel like they know javascript until they read code that others post?",84,47,sQD5fcE,2021-10-11 16:37:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/q5zv4r/feeling_like_you_know_javascript_until_you_read/,0,learnjavascript

j0ik6h,How to properly use `if` statements,"Last week, I came on here talking about how I've had a few patterns pop up repeatedly during my career, which seem to be a trend among many developers even if they're not the best idea in practice.  That time, I talked about variable reassignment.  Now, I have something new to talk about... `if` statements. :)

First of all, last week I said there's an argument to be had that we may never need to use `let`.  Today I stand corrected, because as I took a stab at ""Big O"" algorithms, I had no choice but to change a few variables during iterations.  That said, I think if you're new to `const` and `let`, then you're probably not looking at algorithms yet, so I'd stick with the rule of thumb that you *almost* never have to change your variables, so use constants instead.  Okay, now that my correction is out of the way, onto the new topic.

When running a function with lots of conditions, I often see complex nested `if` blocks popping up, and sometimes they can be extremely difficult to follow.  Below may be easy enough for right now, but it's setting the foundation for functionality we expect to grow.

    const order = function(customOrder) {
        if (customOrder.pizza && customOrder.toppings) {
          if (customOrder.pizza === 'redsauce') {
            if (customOrder.vegetarian) {
              var toppings = [
                'olives',
                'peppers',
                'tomatoes'
              ];
            } else if (customOrder.meatLovers) {
              var toppings = [
                'sausage',
                'bacon',
                'ham',
              ];
            } else if (customOrder.everything) {
              var toppings = [
                'olives',
                'peppers',
                'tomatoes',
                'sausage',
                'bacon',
                'ham',
              ];
            }
            return toppings;
          }
        }
        return [];
    };

With just a few intentional habits, you can write code that's scalable the first time you write it, instead of merely accepting the inevitability of tech debt and eventual refactoring.

Rule #1: use early returns instead of wrapping your code in an `if` block.  If the whole function is inside one big block, then you can easily avoid one indent level like this.

    const order = function(customOrder) {
        if (!customOrder.pizza || !customOrder.toppings) return [];
        if (customOrder.pizza !== 'redsauce') return [];
        // other scripts
    };

Rule #2: consolidate conditions into variables/constants, and use fewer `if` statements if possible.

    const order = function(customOrder) {
        const hasToppingOptions = customOrder.pizza
          && customOrder.toppings
          && customOrder.pizza === 'redsauce';
        if (!hasToppingOptions) return [];
        // other scripts
    };

Now, when you read the expression in plain English, it's suddenly very clear what this code is supposed to do, and it lets us be more concise.

Rule #3: Do not use `if` blocks to assign values.  Even though the variable `toppings` is not being reassigned here, it's being optionally defined in multiple locations, which is just as confusing.  We're better off defining it once with a ternary, but we can take it a step further than that by defining a couple different arrays and optionally concatenating them.

    const vegToppings = [
      'olives',
      'peppers',
      'tomatoes'
    ];
    const meatToppings = [
      'sausage',
      'bacon',
      'ham'
    ];
    return customOrder.vegetarian ? vegToppings
      : customOrder.meatLovers ? meatToppings
      : vegToppings.concat(meatToppings);

There's a few different ways you could write this, this is just my own preferred method.  The point isn't to take this exact approach, but just to look for ways that you can avoid defining a variable in more than one place. Using `if` blocks in this situation leads to less readable code, more bug-prone code, and code that is difficult to troubleshoot should a bug arise.

*NOTES*: Some people are (rightfully) weary of ternaries.  I'll address some concerns here:

* **They get overused** \- yes, if your code is using ternaries as `if` blocks, they should be replaced by the more readable `if` statement.  This rule is not to encourage that usage.  This rule is intended to assign (or return) a value in only one place.
* **They can be confusing to read** \- yes, but I would argue if they are, you haven't consolidated your conditions into readable constants.  In other words, `isAwesome ? 'awesome' : 'not cool'` is easy to read, but `(isHayaoMiyazaki || isSolidSnake || isSamusAran) && !stolenArt && playableInSSB ? 'awesome' : 'not cool'` ... you get the point.  Put all that into one constant called `isAwesome`, and you got yourself a readable ternary.  If you have more than one or two conditions, I would avoid nesting ternaries, as outlined [in my other thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/ivz59q/why_you_shouldnt_reassign_variables/)

When all is said and done, the function we started with now looks like this:

    const order = function(customOrder) {
        const hasToppingOptions = customOrder.pizza
          && customOrder.toppings
          && customOrder.pizza === 'redsauce';
        if (!hasToppingOptions) return [];
        const vegToppings = [
          'olives',
          'peppers',
          'tomatoes'
        ];
        const meatToppings = [
          'sausage',
          'bacon',
          'ham'
        ];
        return customOrder.vegetarian ? vegToppings
          : customOrder.meatLovers ? meatToppings
          : vegToppings.concat(meatToppings);
    };

Notice how we had 5 `if` conditions previously, and now we ended up with only one, and it's not even wrapping a block of code.  A function with fewer indent levels is a function that is much easier and straightforward to read and understand.

So are `if` blocks *bad*?  Not always, but their usage should be much less passive.  What I mean by that is some people write them so frequently that they're just second nature, and that's when they become dangerous.  They should never be used just because a dev was on auto-pilot.  Make the above habits your new auto-pilot, and use `if` blocks only when they require *active thought*.

Whew, there's round two, I put a lot of effort into this one too.  Hope these are helping people!

I know that sometimes taking everything in as a newbie can be overwhelming, but these are the kinds of things I wish I knew from the start, so that I wouldn't develop bad habits in the first place.  Unfortunately, there's a lot of learning material out there that ignores or sometimes encourages these methods, so you might get into a bad habit just simply by following some common examples.  These posts are my small effort to help the ""me"" from 10 years ago.

ic4bjh,What and should I learn to become better in JavaScript?,"Hello Redditors!

These last couple years I have been busy with learning about JavaScript and its libraries/frameworks. And now I am at the point where I am wondering what I should learn to build/do to TRUELY learn JavaScript. 

To give some depth, you could say I have learned about these things: https://www.w3schools.com/js/ . I know what it is, I know what they can do in the smaller scope, etc. Just look up any 'learn javascript' tutorial on youtube that tells you about variables, arrays, strings up to classes and prototypes. I know about them. I have heard a milion times that you make a class, with a constructor and now you can use that to make multiple coloured cars (yay!).

But even tho I have spend time to understand it, I simply cannot fathom how developers seem to build all these awesome frameworks and libraries like React/Vue/Angular/jQuery and many more. Is every library just a milion objects, bloated with prototypes, bloated with methods, so someone can call it? How do people call them in extensions. Etc. 

I hope I gave a good idea of what I am struggling with. I do find it hard to explain. In a nutshell, what should I do or what resources should I follow, what things should I build (and what tutorials could help me) so I can truely build stuff with javascript. Where does everything truely come together.

7loqb4,What it took for me to get hired full time.,"A few months ago I made my first extremely excited post when i got picked up for a contract. I had been teaching myself Javascript and front end development for 3 or 4 months. It was a huge milestone that someone who I met and talked to wanted me to be part of their team, and work on actual code. It was a small startup and  had excellent potential for learning bleeding edge tech like GraphQL, Meteor(node), and working in React. 

This is another milestone, I have been hired full time(just signed my offer letter and start next week) as a software Engineer at a company that is established and works in react mainly. Im really excited and part of me feels undeserving (imposter syndrome) which I didn't experience previously. If I were reading this two weeks ago before I knew this was happening, I would want to know the following-

* How did I connect with this employer? 

I went to lots of local meetups, and met the hiring party directly, in person. We emailed shortly after and he sent a small challenge which I passed and then came in for an interview. In the interview I was as straightforward as I could be, explaining my passion for coding, balancing it with my limitations and needs as a new developer(ie. a team and mentorship with a company that has clear standards and operations I can learn.). I did not inflate my abilities or try to 'sell myself'. I feel like there is a lot of bad advice about trying to present a certain way, I strive to be rigorously honest in all my activities. 

*  What skills were important?

To be honest I'm not sure what exactly clicked, but I believe it came through clearly that I don't just want to make things work, I want to understand why and how they work. On the in interview paper (not whiteboard) test I asked if we could go over it together instead of just walking away. As we went over it I explained my thoughts on what each problem was, how I processed a solution, and what other possibilities were and why I eliminated them. I also learned in that process as we discussed the answers and other possible solutions that I hadn't seen.

* How did you learn?

I am self taught, no degree, worked in unrelated field for 15 years. No way could I afford the cost of a coding bootcamp. I went through freeCodeCamp.org's front end developer program and am still working on the back end dev stuff. I also took almost all of Wes Bos's courses, and some courses through frontend masters (they recently have made some huge upgrades to their site, great stuff). I put a focus on working on projects and even as I worked through courses I was mentally trying to apply these concepts to my own ends. Projects are key in my learning process, whether I finish all of them or not, starting and working with the tooling is sometimes enough. In that I mean learn when you've bitten off more than you can chew (like a graphQL, apollo, auth0, react app I never finished lol). I want to me clear about this- CODE EVERY DAY, not just for an hour, or two, but as much as you can stand. I was able to study like it was my full time job, so those of you who don't have that luxury will have to work double. Weekends were for personal projects and smaller fun things, and weekdays went to larger classes and looking deeper into MDN to understand how things work. I also learned a lot going to meetups, and speaking at meetups forced me to research and understand enough to teach. 

* What didnt work?

Recruiters, they call a lot now that my information is out there. At the Jr level these are not super useful people when looking for work. Your mileage may vary, but I spent a lot of time talking to people who don't know enough about coding to know I am not writing 'Java'. Don't get me wrong, some were sharp and insightful and were even helpful in getting my resume straightened out. Another thing that didn't turn out for me was blindly applying for jobs. I think any job that I clicked 'quick apply' or 'easy apply' was just a low percentage shot. I think I got better responses from taking my time writing cover letters and tailoring my resume to the job. Come to think of it, those were jobs that got some response at all while the others drifted off into the ether.

I'm planning to follow up after my first month or so, but I know it's going to be a challenge so I may get wrapped up too much to be prompt about it. 

Also, in my prior post I was asked a LOT about compensation, which for the contract position I had was shoestring at best (startups are what they are). I will not comment specifically on this but the compensation for this position is more than I was expecting and above the going rate in my area for someone at my level, I'm extremely grateful for that.

q12ytb,Learning OOP is melting my brain.,"I'm currently learning OOP at freeCodeCamp and its concept is driving me crazy.

Can someone give me a practical usage of it being used in real life?

Like an example on how you use it for your website? When is it needed? or How you call it?

&#x200B;

Because in freeCodeCamp, they giving an example of movie/music info record includes title, name, imdbRating.... (which I find it really useful) but I don't know how you Have or Store all of the information and accessed it in javascript?

I also learn that it also could be really nice use to access your own customize function by calling using . (""dot"") which is really interesting. But I never have a chance to actually apply it, do you?

&#x200B;

Other than those 2 examples , I can't wrap my head around to see what is the practice of OOP.  I feel so defeat and confused.

kggtfa,What skills are required to be a freelance JavaScript developer?,"Hello everyone, u/technoman555 here. I have a few questions regarding being a freelance JavaScript developer.

Since I started learning JavaScript in school a few months ago, I noticed that there is a huge number of freelance JavaScript jobs on sites such as Freelancer and Upwork, so I thought about earning some cash through these jobs before getting into college while I'm still in high school.

Keep in mind, I am still a beginner (regarding web development), so my questions might be a bit vague. Here are the questions I want to ask:

* What skills (besides JavaScript, HTML and CSS) should I possess?
* Do I need to know HTML and CSS (web design) on the same level as JavaScript or can I just have basic knowledge of it while programming mainly in JavaScript?
* What kind of things will I program as a JavaScript developer?
* How would I, as someone who hasn't had a job anywhere, maximize the chance of being picked for a freelance JavaScript job?

Just so you know, I am **not** planning to become a full-time JavaScript developer (for now), as I'm more interested in low-level programming and embedded systems.

I want to learn JavaScript since it is one of the most popular and paid programming languages in the world right now and because there are lots of freelance jobs for it.

Thank you all in advance for your answers!

Edit: As far as programming itself is concerned, I have been programming in the C programming language for 3+ years and have also started learning C# along JS.",80,51,technoman555,2020-12-19 21:34:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/kggtfa/what_skills_are_required_to_be_a_freelance/,0,learnjavascript

ch2t3b,"What are some key JS concepts a developer should know at the start of their career, and does this change over time/with seniority?","I'm an I/T professional who's looking to move out of my current line of work and into development. I've worked at an EMR for the past 16 years, hand-in-hand with our developers for all of it. For the past 8 years, I've been doing most of the design work, but I'm not a programmer, so I use desktop applications to design the interface and hand it off to our programming team who then transform it into modules for our application.

I recently completed pre-course work and a test/challenge for a coding bootcamp, as part of a process to learn programming. Its a full-stack web development track and the actual course will begin in early August. The focus for the pre-course was on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as many of you will expect.

I wanted to know from those of you who are already working - what are the JavaScript concepts (or programming concepts, in general) that you have used the most in your work? And, what do you wish you had gone in knowing more about.

From completing the test/challenge this AM, I know that I will need to learn a lot more about array methods, but I'm curious about what concepts are most-used or most-critical by developers and, if possible, does this change with the level of the developer from junior to senior?

n46syu,Is it wrong to continue using jQuery even if it's beginning to be deprecated?,"I'm a beginner to JavaScript, and haven't been working with it long. Any actual, functional JS code I've written in jQuery. I've been hearing about how jQuery is beginning to be deprecated, and have been seeing it used less and less, e.g. Bootstrap 5 dropping jQuery dependency, so for a recent project I decided to not use jQuery and attempt to do everything in vanilla JavaScript. In the process, I've discovered I need to learn a lot of new things, figure out a lot of workarounds, or do things in a lot less efficient ways. I'm not enjoying it. Is it really 'necessary', or more so 'ahead of / with the curve' to begin to stop using jQuery? Should I even waste my time getting better at jQuery? This is an important question for me, because even if jQuery is more convenient (to me at least, as I haven't been messing with vanilla JS long), I don't want to be using it now if in \~5-10 years websites with jQuery will be seen as 'outdated' and intricate skill with jQuery will not be required in the job market.

&#x200B;

edit: Everyone on this thread has been very helpful, thank you all! I've learned a lot about the capabilities of newer JS via jQuery and have decided I'm not going to focus on anything new regarding jQuery and improve my vanilla JS skills and then learn more popular libraries that all of you have listed such as React",67,122,thebrufo,2021-05-03 20:43:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/n46syu/is_it_wrong_to_continue_using_jquery_even_if_its/,0,learnjavascript
