10onhl2,Want to become an analyst? Start here.,"Starting a career in data analytics can open up many exciting opportunities in a variety of industries. With the increasing demand for data-driven decision-making, there is a growing need for professionals who can collect, analyze, and interpret large sets of data. In this post, I will discuss the skills and experience you'll need to start a career in data analytics, as well as tips on learning, certifications, and how to stand out to potential employers.

Starting out, if you have questions beyond what you see in this post, I suggest doing a search in this sub.

**Commonly Asked Questions –**

Q) Do I need a degree?

A) Its helpful. Many job postings for DA ask for a bachelor’s degree.

&#x200B;

Q) Will the Google Data Analyst certificate from Coursera be enough to get me a DA job?

A) No. Not even close. The course teaches you some of the basic technical concepts of the industry and that’s about it. My feeling on the course is this – If you took the entire thing from start to finish and it didn’t scare you away, you may have a chance at this.

More on this certification -- It is marketed really well as being a potential game changer.  This cert gets asked about 10x more than any other.  Again, it is not a magical key to the industry.  It lets you peek in the door to see what you are getting yourself into.

&#x200B;

Q) How do I transition from X field I am in today to become a Data Analyst?

A) See the list below for the tips on how to do it.

&#x200B;

Q) I already have a degree in X, will that help me?

A) Depends on the position, the recruiter, and the company.  Most job postings show that they are looking for a degree in a related field -- Business, Statistics, etc.  The more relevant, the better your chances are that it will help.  Remember, a degree is just one part of an entire package you should have to help you transition into the field.

&#x200B;

Q) What do I need to learn?

A) Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI or Tableau is a good place to start. I would also learn them in that order. From those, you can start branching out to learn more, such as SSRS, Azure, SAS, Looker, Alteryx, etc.

&#x200B;

Q) Do certifications matter?

A) Depends on the person doing the hiring. To some recruiters, it means you have at the minimum a basic knowledge set on the topic. To others, they may see them as useless throwaways that anyone spending 30 minutes on the Internet could get.

&#x200B;

Q) Can I get a job right away?

A) Depends on your experience level.  If you are trying to break in from another career, its going to be difficult and like any job hunt, you will probably be passed up for those that are experience already.  Its going to come down to your knowledge of the field and how well you market yourself.  See #11 below.

&#x200B;

Q) Is having a degree in X enough to get me a DA role?

A) Probably not.  Again, depends on the company and the hiring manager.  You are going to improve your chances by adding a great resume and experience to your degree.

\---------------------------------------------------

**Roadmap to break in to analytics:**

1. Build a Strong Foundation in Data Analysis and Visualization: The first step in starting a career in data analytics is to familiarize yourself with the basics of data analysis and visualization. This includes learning SQL for data manipulation and retrieval, Excel for data analysis and visualization, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau. There are many online resources, tutorials, and courses that can help you to learn these skills. Look at Udemy, YouTube, DataCamp to start out with.
2. Get Hands-on Experience: The best way to gain experience in data analytics is to work on data analysis projects. You can do this through internships, volunteer work, or personal projects. This will help you to build a portfolio of work that you can showcase to potential employers. If you can find out how to become more involved with this type of work in your current career, do it.
3. Network with people in the field: Attend data analytics meetups, conferences, and other events to meet people in the field and learn about the latest trends and technologies. LinkedIn and Meetup are excellent places to start. Have a strong LinkedIn page, and build a network of people.
4. Education: Consider pursuing a degree or certification in data analytics or a related field, such as statistics or computer science. This can help to give you a deeper understanding of the field and make you a more attractive candidate to potential employers. There is a debate on whether certifications make any difference. The thing to remember is that they wont negatively impact a resume by putting them on.
5. Learn Machine Learning: Machine learning is becoming an essential skill for data analysts, it helps to extract insights and make predictions from complex data sets, so consider learning the basics of machine learning. Expect to see this become a larger part of the industry over the next few years.
6. Build a Portfolio: Creating a portfolio of your work is a great way to showcase your skills and experience to potential employers. Your portfolio should include examples of data analysis projects you've worked on, as well as any relevant certifications or awards you've earned. Include projects working with SQL, Excel, Python, and a visualization tool such as Power BI or Tableau. There are many YouTube videos out there to help get you started. Hot tip – Once you have created the same projects every other aspiring DA has done, search for new data sets, create new portfolio projects, and get rid of the same COVID, AdventureWorks projects for your own.
7. Create a Resume: Tailor your resume to highlight your skills and experience that are relevant to a data analytics role. Be sure to use numbers to quantify your accomplishments, such as how much time or cost was saved or what percentage of errors were identified and corrected. Emphasize your transferable skills such as problem solving, attention to detail, and communication skills in your resume and cover letter, along with your experience with data analysis and visualization tools. If you struggle at this, hire someone to do it for you. You can find may resume writers on Upwork.
8. Practice: The more you practice, the better you will become. Try to practice as much as possible, and don't be afraid to experiment with different tools and techniques. Practice every day. Don’t forget the skills that you learn.
9. Have the right attitude: Self-doubt, questioning if you are doing the right thing, being unsure, and thinking about staying where you are at will not get you to the goal. Having a positive attitude that you WILL do this is the only way to get there.
10. Applying: LinkedIn is probably the best place to start. Indeed, Monster, and Dice are also good websites to try. Be prepared to not hear back from the majority of companies you apply at. Don’t search for “Data Analyst”. You will limit your results too much. Search for the skills that you have, “SQL Power BI” will return many more results. It just depends on what the company calls the position. Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Visualization Specialist, Business Intelligence Manager could all be the same thing.  How you sell yourself is going to make all of the difference in the world here.
11. Patience: This is not an overnight change. Its going to take weeks or months at a minimum to get into DA.

Be prepared for an application process like this

100 – Jobs applied to

65 – Ghosted

25 – Rejected

10 – Initial contact with after rejects & ghosting

6 – Ghosted after initial contact

3 – 2nd interview or technical quiz

3 – Low ball offer

1 – Maybe you found something decent after all of that

I feel like everything I do is a mistake, so I triple check everything I work on and then worry I’m going too slow and not getting enough done to meet deadlines. I just failed to meet a deadline for the first time today. I feel like I’ve been so disorganized and like I might not be cut-out for this unforgiving work.

Is this normal? Will it get better? Will I get better if I keep at it? What can I do to keep my tasks organized? Please help!",653,186,Similar-Effective477,2023-10-24 05:07:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/17f52jq/help_my_first_data_job_is_ruining_me/,0,dataanalysis
17f6buq,I finally gave up,"I spent 8 months of my life trying and failing to become a data analyst, and have finally given up on it. After getting laid off in November of last year I decided to make a career change and become a data analyst. I had no experience and knew I’d have to learn a lot of skills to get my foot in the door. I had a good amount of savings so decided to study full time, enrolled in a Data Analytics bootcamp and spent all my time outside of class reinforcing what I’d learned. I got really good with Python, excel (VBA scripting), SQL and tableau and had a good understanding of the data analysis process after around 6-7 months of studying full time. I graduated the course and continued doing personal projects and started applying for jobs, which I was optimistic about at first, but quickly realized literally nobody wants to hire an entry level Data Analyst right now. I applied for jobs all day every day for almost 3 months, sent out 312 tailored resumes with my skills and projects from my GitHub and got a couple interviews but nothing came of them. After 3 months of sending applications into the void I finally gave up and last week just accepted a job offer doing what I was doing before I got laid off, as I had plenty of experience in that on my resume.  It really sucks to have spent so much time and effort learning these things that I will probably never use now, but I’m really not sure what I could do differently. I have the skills but just never got a chance to prove it, just couldn’t get my foot in the door. I guess this is a warning that data analysis is really over saturated right now, so if you are thinking of a career change and have no experience or connections in data analysis I just want to warn you of my experience.",628,212,Acceptable_Capital77,2023-10-24 06:31:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/17f6buq/i_finally_gave_up/,0,dataanalysis

xg0c4u,I started the Google Data Analytics course on July 26th. I got a job offer yesterday. Here’s how I did it.,"Basically I got lucky. I finished the course on August 27th. I then applied for 10 jobs. The next day I posted my resume on r/resume for some feedback. Turns out my resume was terrible. After changing my resume I applied to 40 more jobs and updated my LinkedIn. Out of those 50 total applications I put in, I got two interviews. I made it to the final interview for both jobs, but didn’t get an offer.  But since I updated my LinkedIn, a recruiter reached out to me. For context, I was an accountant and I have a degree in accounting. He was looking for someone with strong accounting knowledge and SQL/Python skills. I was the perfect fit. I nailed the interview process and signed my offer yesterday!

EDIT: Many have asked to see the resume that got me the job, so I've added it. I'm aware, it is not fancy. I've whited out all of my personal info.

16nsxoo,I gave up on data analyst career - You can too!,"I'm a Finance Analyst, and after around 1 year into my career, I decided that I would like to become a Data Analyst instead. I was always passionate about finance, but when it comes to work, DA seemed more interesting and appealing to me, and I liked that salaries are generally higher compared to working in finance.

I do a lot of analytical work in Excel and SQL, so I couldn't imagine a better start. Over time I also learned Python for DA, basics of Power BI, and completed 2 different DA certs and 1 project for my resume. 

I applied to **lots** of Data Analyst positions for over a year, but rarely got any feedback. Sometimes I got to pre-interview assessments, which were really hard and I usually failed. I also landed a couple of interviews, but did not receive any offers. Employers always went for people with actual DA working experience instead of me. 

Around 2 months ago I got a bit tired and took a break from searching for DA positions. I decided to focus on my actual workplace for a while, and I actually managed to negotiate a promotion and an extremely generous raise. That really made me re-think my career goals, as with the right approach, the better salary argument was no longer the case.  In fact, right now I make same amount of money as my friends in tech (mid data scientists or software developers). Switching careers to an Intern or Junior Data Analyst would be a huge financial hit for me, and it would take me many years just to match my future salary in finance.

I also have reconsidered the aspect of how interesting the jobs actually are. In practise, financial analysis is nearly a data analysis itself. The data simply happens to be financial. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that being a highly-skilled financial analyst is the best choice for me, as I can combine analytical skills with the industry that I'm interesed in. 

**My overall conclusions are:**

* If you're unhappy in your current job, it doesn't mean you have to change the industry. Maybe you can find a similar position, but on much better terms in different company. Or maybe just negotiate your salary or ask for promotion in current workplace.
* If you like Data Analysis, you can also apply DA skills to your current position, whatever it might be, and become more valuable employee. 
* **Don't fall for hype around Data Analyst career**. Consider that it might actually be overrated.",478,166,Tyszq,2023-09-20 18:40:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/16nsxoo/i_gave_up_on_data_analyst_career_you_can_too/,0,dataanalysis

This new opportunity did not disclose the salary.

He called to asked me what he should do. 

I told him to let them know that once the offer was made, he would disclose his earnings history. 

But not to do so before hand. So that is what he did. 

The offer came in at $190K. He then showed them his W-2. 

If he'd agreed to divulge his old salary, he may have lost out on 50K or 60K.

144876v,Become a Data Analyst without any Experience? My thoughts as an analyst...,"Hi everyone, I'm a data analyst with my own training company full time and a lot of the time, people ask me how to become a Data Analyst without any experience. And to be honest, it's definitely possible.

I've posted this as a comment here before and it got a lot of responses, so thought I'd make a post.

**Firstly base your learning around portfolio projects BUT 3-5 Portfolio Projects is not enough!**

This may be overkill but aim for 10 projects upwards especially if you don't have much experience and you want to stick out from the crowd. These projects will serve as your ""work experience"" so the more, the better

Make sure you cover the following topics as employers tend to like this:

**Tableau**

* Sales Analytics (Analyzing sales and factors that effect sales - can create a dashboard where the user selects like a sales person, and the dashboard will give you this an overview month sales, last month sales and target). Something like this looks good [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kasia.gasiewska.holc/viz/SuperstoreSalesDashboard\_16534148636030/SuperstoreSalesDashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kasia.gasiewska.holc/viz/SuperstoreSalesDashboard_16534148636030/SuperstoreSalesDashboard)
* HR Analytics - this is always good to bring up in an interview as usually you will have someone in HR interview you, it's usually an easy dataset as well - maybe something like this dashboard ([https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gandes.goldestan/viz/HRDashboard\_16284874251120/Overview](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gandes.goldestan/viz/HRDashboard_16284874251120/Overview))
* Marketing Analytics as well will be a good one to add to your portfolio. Really great for bigger companies who spend millions on marketing. ([https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tableau.for.marketing/viz/DigitalMarketingCampaignPerformanceDashboard/DigitalMarketingCampaignPerformanceDashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tableau.for.marketing/viz/DigitalMarketingCampaignPerformanceDashboard/DigitalMarketingCampaignPerformanceDashboard))

If you're looking for ideas, go to [https://public.tableau.com/app/search/all](https://public.tableau.com/app/search/all) and type in Sales Dashboard etc. You'll get lots of ideas and you can download the tableau workbook to see how the author has created it.

But don't stop at 3. Do it for every business process - the good thing here is you can use Tableau Public which is free and publish your dashboards online, here's an example of mine that I use for the udemy courses. [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/devasha5179](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/devasha5179) 

**Python**

* Always nice to learn to create an interactive dashboard something like this [https://realpython.com/python-dash/](https://realpython.com/python-dash/)
* Although not strictly data analytics, learning some machine learning will do well. I like to go to [Kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com/), under competitions, filter to ""Getting Started"" competitions, and select one you find interesting. You also get to view other peoples solutions which will help you learn.
* Learn how to webscrape on Python, there's a bunch of tutorials online.
* Also nice to throw in sentiment analysis as well - maybe from social media data like reddit.

Post all the code on github, share it on your resume. 

**SQL**

And then adding some sql projects as well as that's another important language in DA, something like this: [https://medium.com/@Armonia1999/data-analysis-project-using-sql-to-clean-and-analyse-data-64a24e84b730](https://medium.com/@Armonia1999/data-analysis-project-using-sql-to-clean-and-analyse-data-64a24e84b730). I think you don't need to get too complicated with SQL as that's what we have Python and Tableau.

**Adding to your resume**

Always make sure whatever you do gets added to your resume. I generally tell my students every project you do, create a little write up an include:

* Objective
* Steps Performed
* Challenges
* Outcome
* Next steps

This is great for your resume and will help with interview prep. Having the ability to summarize your process in a way that's easy to digest is a great skill to have and will look good in an interview.

**Blog/Youtube/ Social Media**

Start a blog, post tutorials, post on LinkedIn. I find the more you network with people in the same industry, the better chance you have of some recruiter stumbling upon your posts and making contact. 

**Doing Courses**

This is a big one and I'm saying this an an instructor that teaches Data Analytics online... you don't need to do a lot of courses. 1 or 2 is enough and they don't need to costs thousands. Do one or two courses and just make sure it's something that you enjoy. Python/SQL/Tableau, whatever. I've interviewed candidates and I've spoken with many Tech Recruiters, 1 - 2 courses is more than enough for your resume

Hope this helps some of you! Also, as we know, economy is terrible at the moment and looking for a job is hard so don't give up!",434,37,databudd,2023-06-08 12:40:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/144876v/become_a_data_analyst_without_any_experience_my/,0,dataanalysis

191if7j,I've just landed my first job as Data/Bussiness analyst,"As the title says, I just received an email from the CEO of the company. He expressed his appreciation for our meeting and promptly invited me to a chemistry meetup where he will showcase the office, and I will have the opportunity to meet my future colleagues.

Until three weeks ago, I had zero experience in data analysis. A friend of mine, who has been working as a freelance data analyst for six years, always intrigued me with his success. He seemed to have a lot of free time, was not bound by strict schedules, and earned a decent salary. Curious about his secret, I asked him about his work, and he introduced me to the basics of ETL. I was immediately hooked.

I researched courses on Power BI, ETL and ELT software, and finally, SQL and Big Query. After completing as much as I could, I reached out to recruiters on LinkedIn. One recruiter mentioned that they typically look for candidates with 2+ years of experience, but she gave me a chance. During our call, I was able to answer many questions.

The following week, I attended a meetup with the CEO. It was challenging as he was straightforward, mentioning that he was seeking skills I didn't possess. Nevertheless, he decided to give me a chance with a demo project to see how I would handle unfamiliar tasks. I had a week to learn how to connect to an API via JSON, transform the data with SQL, and create a comprehensive report in Power BI.

During the second call with the CEO, two other team members joined, and I presented my project to them, carefully explaining each step. I even added a few jokes at the end and enjoyed the experience.

Now, as I read that email, I'm unsure about what to do with my life! I am thrilled that I can finally transition to a new career. Having been a salesman for eight years since the beginning of my work life, turning 30 in two months makes me feel like an 18-year-old starting work for the first time.

Anyway, that's it. Just venting my feelings. Have a good one, guys! 😄",417,112,Present-Statement-78,2024-01-08 10:42:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/191if7j/ive_just_landed_my_first_job_as_databussiness/,0,dataanalysis

198v59g,Youtube Data Influencer's Advice will not get you hired!,"There is so many videos about ""How to learn Data Analysis in 2024"". All are just videos saying  learn this tool and this programming language. Its all ineffective if you can't  break down a problem statement, identify what data sources are needed and communicate insights.i do see these gurus telling viewers anything other than learn excel, then sql then python. But why no actual analysis!

Im a 15 year senior data analyst and currently  hired to evaluate potential cadidates for a data analyst  role in a major fortune 30 company.

We send out a basic form of 20 questions after an HR interview for the technical round. I've reviewed 70 cadidates in the last 3 weeks.

1. Only 10% actually can form a problem statement, hypothesis or follow a scientfic method for case studies.

2. Almost no one can describe insights & how to find insights

3.  There is a lot a major difficulty understanding how data should be mapped in data bases. Star schema and normalization.

4. Little understanding of basic stats. Quartile central tendency..etc

5. We do have a SQL portion but syntax isn't specified or forced its designed to see if the candidate understands how join dimension and fact table. 80% do well here
here

6. We have a data viz portion, but everyone struggles with why a box plot are used.  There are question on why a 100% stacked bar chart is preferred over a pie chart.

7. Only about 40% knew the difference between a KPI and a metric. 

There's is no python or excel because these are great tools but actually if I provide the user with a table you should be able answer questions without tools.

My advice is to get a basic stat book or course, don't just learn sql syntax. Also understand how and why data is normalized and structured in a database. Master the scientific method, check out KPI blueprints from Google and study a bit of numerical reason. 

My best piece of advice is to abandon any YouTube channel that says data analysis is about mastering tool progression.",398,106,Equal_Astronaut_5696,2024-01-17 12:11:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/198v59g/youtube_data_influencers_advice_will_not_get_you/,0,dataanalysis
185dcqo,It's bad out there,"Yeah, it is bad out there in the job market. Good people struggling to get jobs, newbies banging their heads against the brick wall wondering how to get in. 

Two things to spark light in the gloom - one observation and one piece of advice

1) I think its going to get better. The recruiters I speak to are seeing an increase in the Data Architect and Data Governance roles coming into the market. Their read is that this shows firms getting their ducks in a row regarding data, in particular planning for onboarding in a ""correct way"" either from a technical or regulatory point of view. And then they will need Data Engineers to pipe the data into their perfectly planned infrastructure and then Analysts and Data Scientists to extract the good stuff. So the thinking is that its the first step to a rebound. When? How much? Which markets? Sorry, no crystal ball there. You could do your own checks for Data Architect roles near you today vs 3 months ago if you like? Nice time series, line graph...

2) A piece of advice. If you are trying to break into Analytics and maybe have a course or two under your belt, for the love of all that is holy, get yourself some practical experience. Find a dataset that you care about and interrogate the f\*\*\* out of it. Answer questions that you have. If you like Ice Hockey, get some NHL data and answer questions like ""Using advanced metrics and salary data, find the most under valued player who drives positive game outcomes"" or ""which team over the last twenty years were able to come back the most when down goals late in the game"". As explained in my book which has just been released (shameless plug: [https://www.amazon.co.uk/aia/dp/B0CNY8LLFW](https://www.amazon.co.uk/aia/dp/B0CNY8LLFW)) as a hiring manager, if I get someone who has built analyses which answer interesting questions, I'm far more likely to look favorably on them. Especially if they are allowed to share the code/thinking/results. Which you usually can't if you have done Analytics as your job. 

I know its hard out there. Things will get better. While you wait, make sure you are the obvious choice.

165892i,My Path from Data Analyst to Data Engineer: Tips & Key Takeaways,"**I originally posted this in** r/dataengineering **and thought it would be great to get some feedback from my intended audience as well!**

___

I'm delivering an internal talk to other consultants at my company (primarily Data Analytics Consultants) about my personal journey to become a Data Engineer ( Photographer --> DA --> DE ).

I've been compiling a list of tips and takeaways to punctuate my talk and I'm hoping to get some input from the [r/dataengineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/) brain trust.

**Here's what I've got (in no particular order):**

1. **Data Engineering is fundamentally just moving data around**, and reshaping it.
2. **Be curious.** Learn how things work. Try stuff out. Experiment.
3. Become **intimately familiar with data types**, sources, and structures.
4. **Learn a General Purpose Programming Language**. It doesn't really matter which one, it's the fundamentals that are important—everything else is just syntax.
   1. If you don't know which one to pick, start with Python
5. **Get good at SQL**. It's nearly 50 years old and you're probably going to retire before it does.
   1. No matter what systems and tools you use there's a good chance that it probably uses SQL or something pretty similar.
   2. Even more modern data stores, like data lakes, are still queried using SQL
6. **Learn to use the command line (PowerShell, CMD or Bash).** There are so many problems that can be solved much faster in the terminal.
7. **Learn how computers work, at least a little bit.** How do they communicate? How do they process and store information? What does a server do?
8. **Do as many personal projects as you can.** Sign up for a GitHub account and publish them there.
9. **Get really comfortable using APIs and parsing JSON data.** Outside of databases this is probably how you're going to interact with most of your data.
10. **Get really good at your tools, and then get better.** But, also be at least familiar with what else is out there.
11. **Understand the differences between a Database, Data Lake, and Data Warehouse.** What's the difference between OLTP and OLAP?
12. **Learn to use a Cloud Platform.** AWS has a pretty good Free Tier, try it out and learn what the different services do.
13. **Strong business knowledge is extremely valuable** in both Data Engineering and Data Analytics.
14. Understand different business metrics and how they're calculated.
15. **Learn to find the grain (level of detail) of data.** How is it structured? What is the smallest unit? What exactly is a ""row"" in this table?
16. **When it comes to data, everything (almost) is either a JSON, XML, CSV/\*SV, SQLite, or Database.**
17. Even proprietary files with different extensions are probably one of these. Tableau and Alteryx files are just XML files, and many applications store data in .db files (SQLite).
18. Sometimes a file is just a zipped folder of files. Excel for example is just a zipped folder of XML files.

That's what I've got so far, but the talk is next week so I've got some time to make changes.

What did I miss? What should I remove?

My new job requires me to manage the company's database, on Microsoft access. Handle nearly 100s of excel files, pivot tables and dashboards etc.
Generate daily reports using mail merge on word and i would be using a bit of PowerBI for the monthly reports.

I found that the company was hiring on the 12th of December and within an hour of the job posting I reached out to the IT department's head and met him personally. He was surprised that I actually walked in and fixed a meeting and interview, he said no one does this, HAHA
The next day i had a proper interview and they got to know about me and told me about the company.
The IT head and the HR Department guy were doubtful of my skills.
They then showed me an issue that they were having and asked me if i could fix it, the issue was with queries in Access. SQL helped me here, i found what was wrong but it required alot of time to be fixed
They then gave me a few dummy files, because they didn't want me make changes on their system and asked me to return 2 days later.
I fixed the issue and generated the reports which were not working earlier.
Then they asked me to solve another issue the database had and gave me 5 more days. But due to holidays here in GCC. The office was shut and i then when i finally went there, they asked me if i could make dashboards on excel (earlier when they were doubting my skills, i had shown them some really beautiful interactive excel dashboards). The dashboards they had were quite boring, basically they were just tables.
Today they asked for my documents, passport etc and the company is in the process of readying paperwork for hiring me.
I am 29 years old

17ivvcy,How much Python do you use for Data Analysis on daily basis?,"I am currently on a self-learning journey of **Data Analytics technical skills**. 

I am wondering if I should keep *Python at the very end of my journey*. I mapped my journey as follows:

* Data Analytics, Visualization and Forecasting using Microsoft Excel (completed)
* Google Data Analytics (completed)
* Microsoft Power BI (80% completed)
* SQL with MySQL (about half completed)
* Tableau (quarter completed)
* Python (not  yet started but I have intermediate level knowledge about Python programming)

I would like some **feedback from fellow redditors working in Data Analysis field** whether they use Python on a  regular basis.

17mbkei,DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the summary of how it's going after the 10th month,"Hi all,

on Dec 19th I launched [DataAnalyst.com](https://dataanalyst.com) \- this is the 10th update, covering performance for October, with hopefully many more to come.

**DataAnalyst.com has now been live for just over 10 months, and we've brought over 1,450 hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site - all of them including a salary range.**

Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on.

While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/DataAnalysis might benefit from the site, especially those looking for a new data analyst job. I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey.

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.

Let's dive right in:

# 1. General Observations

## Stats

**More than one third of all Google impressions and clicks over the last 10 months, happened in October alone.** Newsletter organic growth has been consistently growing, at around 200 new subscribers per month, with the open rate steadily at around 60%.

I'm attributing the main driver to an increased visibility in SERPs (search engine result pages -  basically, on which position in results is your site showing when someone Googles something). For example, the **keyword ""Data Analyst"" is now showing between the 10th - 15th place.**

It's interesting that the site is ranking much higher on ""data analyst"" search, than on ""data analyst jobs"" (still nowhere to be found in results).

Considering I started the project on a domain with no history, no backlinks, no anything, I'm classing this as a massive success. Not only because of how high up ""data analyst"" is showing up (and I know this can disappear overnight) but also as the site is now ranking for approximately 2,200 keywords.

With the **updated release of the Data Analyst salary guide**, I'm trying to programmatically target the following long tail searches:

\- Data analyst jobs in p(State) - i.e Data analyst jobs in Illinois

\- p(Industry) data analyst jobs - i.e Financial data analyst jobs

\- p(Industry) data analyst salary - i.e Financial data analyst salary

\- p(Experience) data analyst jobs - i.e Entry level data analyst jobs

\- p(Experience) data analyst salary - i.e Entry level data analyst salary

Personally, I hate this - I am publishing somehow duplicate but not exactly duplicate pages, for the sole purpose to please the SEO overlords. I understand that going step too far would have a massive hit on the user experience, so I am being very intentional to insure the key information is  consolidated and easy to find.

Where did 6,400 people come from?

* Organic - 57%
* Direct - 32%
* Social - 7% (automated job postings on Twitter, Linkedin, Reddit, FB/IG)
* Referral - 4% (honestly no idea where that's coming from)

While this was another month with no paid postings, **we did partner with American Council of Academic Physical Therapy (ACAPT).** They are looking for a part-time data analyst with 3 - 5 years of experience, and the role is open to remote work in the US. Check out the site for the [job description](https://www.dataanalyst.com/job/data-analyst-psychometrics-and-research-support-81cd0), and send Sandy an email if you think you're a good fit and interested.

## Link me baby one more time

**a) University outreach**

I mentioned in the last two updates that I noticed quite a few .edu emails signed up to the Newsletter. Thought it could be an interesting angle to explore, reaching out to universities, sharing that their students are using the site. I was hoping this would lead to both driving in visitors, as well as potentially getting a backlink that would help increase the authority of the site.

Following the fiasco results of my September efforts to onboard Universities, and cold emailing approximately half 1,700 educational institutions in the US and their admissions' email address with no bites, I repeated the process, this time however looking at .edu backlinks at some of the similar job-boards, and directly reaching out to the selected institutions.

I've pulled together a spreadsheet with information about the University, Career centre or Course detail (i.e MSc in Data Analytics etc), direct link to the section where they are currently sharing resources, and emails for both someone from the department and the career centre.

With 30 institutions identified, results where much better this time:

* Uni 1 - gained 1 backlink to both DA and BA,
* Uni 2 - in the review process to be added on the site in their next refresh in December
* Uni 3 - call scheduled to discuss partnership opportunities

As Monica would say: ""Seven, Seven, SEVEN!""

The rule of seven in marketing states that brands that engage with a customer seven times are more likely to earn the trust and business of that customer.

I've read somewhere that this also applies to cold outreach - one should send between 4-9 follow-up emails in your cold sales outreach to maximize reply rates, so I'll give it couple of more emails before I pull the plug, hoping that with each additional round I could get at least one extra conversation scheduled.

**b) Business / project directories**

Continuing my efforts on the more ""technical"" side of SEO, I've been looking to make a list of business / project directories where I could publish the site - not really looking for traffic, but just a backlink from a reputable site would be a great start.

How most of my efforts went:

*""Free submission? GREAT.*

*Oh, there's a 2 months waitlist, BUT, you can skip it and be published today for just $19 - $99.""*

That's a great business model (unlike my job board) - new startups, side hustlers, indie hackers, solopreneurs create new projects on a daily basis. As they are trying to do anything possible for a quality backlink that improves their domain authority, they turn to these directories, and incapable of waiting, they would likely pay those one off listing fees.

I've submitted the project to around 30 directories, and will wait it out.

While I am extremely grateful for all the directories out there, it's impossible to put $$$ value on what the benefit of listing on them would be.

Money goes to staying alive, time goes to organic growth, and everything else can wait.

# 2. BusinessAnalyst.com crossover

As I've mentioned before, I recently launched BusinessAnalyst.com - where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over the last 9 months with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infrastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (after-all, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa).

Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any consistent revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck.

## Exact same steps, different results

While the lack of revenue is concerning, I'm mainly raising eyebrows about the lack of progress I'm seeing with BusinessAnalyst.

I've created the site with all the learnings from DataAnalyst - automations, site structure, on-page SEO + programmatic pages, automated social media, filters, Google schema and job posting distribution.

All things considered, at launch and in first 4 months it's in a better state than DA was, but, the site is just not getting any traction.

by the 4th month DataAnalyst had:

* steady 50 - 100 visitors per day
* 900ish newsletter subscribers
* ranking for around 300 keywords
* started seeing organic impressions and clicks

meanwhile we just passed 5 months with BusinessAnalyst and:

* 5-10 visitors per day
* 90 newsletter subscribers (and I'm holding up my hand saying I've f'ed up and not send any newsletters yet)
* ranking for 11 keywords
* organic impressions and clicks, well, what organic impressions and clicks?

What the heck is going on there? Is there's some sort of penalty on the domain? Have Google updates been aggressively punishing the site?

I fully understand that the demand for data analyst roles, and data analyst as a career path has skyrocketed in recent years, which likely drives the interest in DataAnalyst site, but the difference should not be that drastic.

What it also doesn't explain is the lack of results from the SEO side.

**Cry for help: Anyone any ideas?**

TLDR update: Still dead, previous signs of life disappeared as fast as they appeared, not sure what and why.

## State of the job market

Time for some brutal honesty here right now - the job market is going through an extremely rough period, with new waves of layoffs being announced on a weekly basis, across industries.

This also inevitably translates to the data analyst job market. While the demand for data professionals is growing, so does the qualified data analyst talent pool, making it extremely hard for entry level data analysts to find their way in.

For those on the market looking for a role, consider becoming a business analyst - it can be an excellent alternative if landing a data analyst role proves challenging.

While both roles involve working with data (requiring very strong Excel skills and proficiency in R), business analysts focus more on interpreting and translating data into actionable insights for decision-makers within an organization.

This role requires a strong understanding of business processes, industry trends, and the ability to communicate effectively with various stakeholders.

It's important to remember that positions in business analysis offer valuable experience even for those whose ultimate goal is to become a data analyst. As a business analyst, you get the chance to learn about the business itself, its practices, protocols, and decision-making process.

More importantly, a strong foundation in business analysis can help an individual understand how to apply data insights in real-world scenarios. It's a role that puts more emphasis on how data can influence business outcomes rather than merely focusing on data manipulation and analysis.

So, while it might not be the originally desired role, becoming a business analyst is not only a great alternative, but it may also increase the long-term value to employers later down the line when shifting into a data analyst role.

## Day in a life of a Business Analyst, with Grace

We've just published an interview with **Grace, who works as a BA at an inventory management and accounting software business.**

Grace talks about her journey from the start of her career, sharing her experiences and insights from 3 different business analyst roles she's worked as.

She's also done brilliantly to summarise the core purpose of a business analyst role:

*""The business analyst exists as a bridge between the business and the code.  Their purpose is to ensure that the code reflects the business needs. That means that the BA needs to balance understanding what the business needs and understanding what is possible in the software so that you can keep expectations realistic.""*

You can read the [full interview](https://www.businessanalyst.com/blog/grace-my-business-analyst-career-journey). I highly recommend it to everyone, as **a lot of her observations are applicable to both data and business analyst roles.**  

And thank you so much Grace for taking the time and sharing your journey <3

17rwwue,3Months as a Data Analyst,"So few months ago I was crying about being jobless and now Im worried if Ill have enough work in my role. This is my first full time position. 

3 months ago I accepted a DA position in a small healthcare company to do visual analytics. Was hired based on my exp in one of the programming software majorly used in healthcare but after joining manager asked if there are cheaper options and I recommended PowerBi based on the usecase. 

Most of my initial weeks is involving working with excel to clean organize data to do analytics. Manager and team were so happy wit my JUST CLEANING tasks that I was offered a full time position and a salary hike with benefits with sponsorship

However, i feel at current phase were Im spending much time organizing and creating new formats of sheets that the company will be using, I will have to spend less time cleaning and just creating reports. Based on my personal experience, I believe my methodology has cut time by 70%. 

My concern is what if I do not have to spend much time doing analytics in the future? My manager did ask me before giving full time if I will have alot of work to do. I said yes coz I wanted a full time. But looks like my methodology of making things efficient will cost me my own job. 

Looking for guidance. TIA

Update1: also just so you all know, my org used a productivity management software that tracks the productivty every 10 mins with the clicks and keyboard and also takes a screenshot every 10 mins. This is the main cause for my concern. But my coworkers do tell they dont use this while some use. 


Update2: I am really surprised by the comments I got. Thank you so much for all the attention and support. I am an international candidate and got job basically after a year. So the fear of losing the job is really in me.

q37irg,Google Data Analysis Course review,"Hi all,

I'm into week 4 of the 7th course, having just a little bit or R and the Capstone to go through. I also just got offered a job as a data analyst and *really* impressed my interviewers which helped with the salary negotiations. For a little bit on my background, I've a decade of experience in project management and wanted to get into data analytics because I'm feeling miserable as a PM, not able to find a job in that field, and my company has no growth opportunities (literally a staff of 10 and 1 new sale in 2 years - most our revenue is recurring so it's sustainable but definitely not getting promoted there until someone retires in 10 years).

I plan to update this review twice. Once after completing the Capstone, and 6 months into my new job. I will break it down into 3 categories, Foundations (Course 1 and 2 and a dash throughout the course), Tools covered (primarily courses 3 through 7), Soft Skills taught, and grade each aspect of the overall course in 4 ways, with minimum scores of 1 and maximums of 5. 

Qualitative review - what was good, bad, in text. Just a paragraph. Skip it if you don't like to read.

Interview prep - the tldr on how useful this type of content was in interviews. Does the knowledge spark join in your future manager.

Job prep - how useful I think this type of content will be on the job. The tldr is market relevancy.

Breadth - how much you have to play with these tools *OUTSIDE* of what the course offers to make use of them. The higher the score, the less I would worry about checking out other places to learn this stuff.

&#x200B;

**Overall comments on the interview process**

I went through a screen, and two interviews at a large institution. The first interview involved a data analyst and the hiring manager. The second interview brought those same two people back and introduced the department VP and a director of the department I am being hired into.

&#x200B;

**Foundations of data analytics**

This part of the courses was phenomenal for getting the job. Talking about the PROCESS of data analytics at a high level, how communication plays a role (this piece is really emphasized in Course 6, again foundations are sprinkled throughout the entire 7 courses), and where engaging stakeholders matters really impressed the decision-makers in my interview. I was interviewed by a VP, 2 director level people (including the hiring manager), and 1 data analyst. The analyst was less impressed, but mastering the process talk and how to engage your stakeholders really impressed the decision-makers in the room. The hiring manager smiled every time I emphasized first understanding the problem, the stakeholders, and the data - she also smiled when I emphasized data cleaning as really important.

* Interview Prep - 5/5. Definitely the most important piece for interviews, as long as you're not being asked to write code or pseudo code. Mastering the foundations impresses the decision-makers.
* Job prep - 3/5. Talking alone won't help you work with data. It's helpful to know who to talk to and how to talk, but it does not make you an analyst. Update Apr. '22 - I'd upgrade this to a 4/5. Getting acquainted with the data and systems at a new company takes time - knowing good and best practices while you do this lets you enhance your learning as you go.
* Breadth - 5/5. I do not think you *have* to go elsewhere for *an introduction* to data analytics concepts. What they cover, in the foundational sense, is *very good.*

**Tools Covered**

Spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, and R are the main tools covered. Listing these on my resume was enough to get a roughly 70% call back across multiple job applications. These tools are *hot* on the market, as best I can tell. That's a much better call back rate than I got for Project Management and other jobs when I last went on the market some 4-5 years ago. The one thing many employers ask about is PowerBI instead of Tableau. I think it's important to tell them on the phone that ""I've learned the skill, it may take a little bit to get used to the tool, but PowerBI and Tableau use the same skill."" Most people seem to agree.

Please note. There are some checklists that they share through the course and these I have used in my current job as a project manager. These tools I would rate as excellent, because a checklist helps you focus your brain cells on the stuff that matters; as long as you establish and follow a good checklist you won't screw up the small stuff.

* Interview Prep - 4/5. Tools will come up during your interviews for data analysis. 100%. Depending on the employer you may or may not have to *show* what you know. Building a Portfolio is super helpful - the course suggests that and my understanding is the Capstone helps you build that (will update when I first update my review in 8 weeks or so).
* Job Prep - 3/5. This grade is **not** a reflection on the course. The market is wildly different depending on company size, and you may have to learn and pull data from a unique ecosystem of software and a unique sets of schema at varying levels of documentation depending on the company. No coursework can truly prepare you for the worst you will see out there. The real world can be very messy, and a lot of what is taught in the course is close to ideal. Update Apr. '22 - this remains spot on; I use Tableau, BIRT, and Oracle Answers as my 3 primary tools (but also Amazon Redshift, Excel, and a couple other tools) in my job. No one course can teach you all you need to be an analyst at any company.
* Breadth - 3/5. You will want to dive into Kaggle, Tableau Public, etc. to see what other people do and build your skills a little bit more than what the course offers. They show you how to build your skills and use the help documentation, which is *really important* but it does not get you to ""I am a master of"" Tableau, R, spreadsheets, or SQL by any stretch. Update Apr. '22 - See update on ""Job Prep"" above - you may end up using more or fewer tools than you'd think and it's all up to your employer.

**Soft** **Skills taught**

The soft skills really matter! Pay attention. They really seem to try to do right by the people taking the course and cover presentation skills, interview skills, strategies for dealing with some amount of ambiguity, having an ally in the room during presentations, etc. This is stuff I wish I had known early in my career, outside of data analytics. If you took this course and ended up working in something completely unrelated to data analytics, you would still take home a lot of skills that are valuable in the workplace.

* Interview Prep - 4/5. While some of the soft skills are not necessarily going to come up during a data analyst interview, a lot of soft strategies like ""repeat the question, make sure you understand and can gather your thoughts, then answer the question"" translate VERY WELL to an interview setting. As you prepare to interview, think about these nuggets of insight they sprinkle across all the courses and really record yourself practicing a presentation like the course suggests. It's super helpful to get rid of those pesky verbal crutches like ""um"" that we all use.
* Job Prep 5/5 - Some of these soft skills I have integrated into my current job as a Project Manager to great success. Some of these things I already learned from experience. I wish I had known all of it at the start of my career.
* Breadth 4/5 - I can only speak to my own experience and these soft skills help you navigate your work environment very effectively. I know there are toxic work environments out there, but luckily I have never been in one. There's unfortunately no substitute for experience here and that's where you'll get the remaining breadth in this area. The more you ask for, convey, and present information, the better you will get at doing this. Update Apr. '22 - I'd upgrade this to a 5/5. My presentation game has shot up through the roof and a part of it is doing some of the common sense suggestions from this course (practicing and validating your presentations, but more importantly ""how"" to practice and validate your presentations).

**Overall course review**

Is your goal to get a job? A+. Master the foundations and practice those soft skills. If your goal is to keep that job once you get it, make sure to dig into the specific things your company does and uses, and do some targeted self-learning. Literally, if it was a logistics company, practice with the map features in Tableau, look for those visualizations in Tableau Public, and learn to use libraries like ggmap and usmap (if in the USA) in R. 

Is your goal to become a better analyst or get a raise? B to B+. I think the comments on my ""Breadth"" score for tools cover explain why.

Update Apr. '22 - I am so happy I did A course before jumping on this career path. I am pretty sure ANY course would help get started on this career path like it helped me switch into it. Tableau is highly in demand and you don't need this course to learn it, but the course sprinkles some context as to how you get and validate that data and (for me) it helped me validate that I really do love this type of work. This is what I want to do, and I'm glad I get paid to do it.

* Interview Prep - 4/5 if you have to do a technical interview to 5/5 if you are interviewing with executives. I would say, when you are contacted to schedule an interview, it is OK to ask what type of interview it will be. HR is mostly in the loop of whether it's going to be a behavioral screen or a technical interview. If it's the hiring manager who called you, you're impressing on them how you like to be prepared - ultimately an attractive quality when you are hiring.
* Job Prep 4/5 - Expect variety from workplace to workplace. Just like you may use JIRA in one place and ZenDesk someplace else (these are both ticketing tools to log work requests), the same is true for data analytics tools. The good news is once you know R, you can learn Python. Same with Tableau and its alternatives, the variety of SQL flavors, and with spreadsheet tools. You may also encounter data in other formats like JSON, XML, and such - the good news is there are plugins and libraries to just convert this into a table, which should be familiar to you by the end of the course. The most important piece, in my opinion, is the emphasis on understanding and communicating. Understand the analysis task, talk to your stakeholders, make use of the right professional forums to get questions answered, and work with your colleagues and you should be fine (at least, I hope I will!). Wish me luck the next 6 months as I discover if I am right here.
* Breadth 4/5. I don't think it's possible to cover everything, and not necessarily useful to dive deep into something like the usmap library in R if you will not be working with map data at all (this is something I took time to dive into for my own portfolio, not covered in the course). I learned how to read the R documentation and solve the hurdles I encountered to map the rent to income ratio across the US and I definitely could not have done that 4 months ago. You're taught how to fish, but there's a lot of different kinds of fish out there.

Edit 1. Completed course now, including the capstone. No new notes other than, the less work experience you have the more you should build a portfolio as the capstone suggests. That will put you in more equal footing to a more experienced applicant without a portfolio. Next update will be several months into my new job to re-evaluate the “job prep” ratings I awarded

Edit 2, Jan 17, 2022. 3 months into my new job as a data analyst. I am loving the job and thriving. My blood pressure is way better. I’ve been a better husband at home and my wife and I are expecting. Life is looking up. HYPE.

I stand by my review, except I’d say that the job prep is EXCELLENT on the logical / intellectual side and merely good on the technical side of things. You get to talk and have kick ass whiteboard (or zoom drawing) sessions that have impressed my colleagues. My Tableau skills are still miles behind the most experienced users, but I’ve been able to quickly up my game while contributing on the thinking / prototyping end of things.

Edit 3, Apr 10, 2022. 6 months in and I have two new things to say.

1- language is the biggest skill learned in this course. Googling assistance to solve a problem you're facing is much easier because you know the language better.

2- One data visualization resource NOT covered in the course that I've found supremely helpful is Steve Wexler's blog (if it is linked in the course, sorry Google) https://www.datarevelations.com/resources/ - Wexler talks through simplifying your visualizations in a very digestible, common sense way.",336,103,Free_Dimension1459,2021-10-07 11:59:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/q37irg/google_data_analysis_course_review/,1,dataanalysis

xx8z4a,Data Analyst First Job,"Well folks, I wanted to say this and just told my family and wife.  I don’t have a lot of friends to celebrate with.  So, I figured I would come on and say that I finally was offered a data analyst position.

I am still cautiously optimistic and still can’t fully believe it.  I got the formal offer and was both relieved/cried.

I’m self taught and don’t have a degree in data analysis, stats, physics or math.  I have a assoc. engineering tech degree I did years ago.  Also, have two other associates. I did it with a combo of mentorship, online courses, and other project guided videos, YouTube, to utilizing my skills to build an online portfolio.  Also, used every skill I could in my current job.  I didn’t do any certs.  Although, that was likely my next step.  I did have a background managing projects, worked closely with engineers, and did do visualization, data collection and data studies years ago.  I also have domain knowledge in the field.

This is not a brag, but I just want to tell others that it really is possible. It is doable, but the level of applications I did and applied to while maintaining my hope...was unforgiving and mentally abusive at one point.  I thought many times, and even told my wife, I wonder if Edison felt this way, like I was Edison trying to invent the light bulb or something.  I got so many rejections, so many interviews that led to only the first call only to get ghosted or rejected.  Others led to 2nd or 3rd and I did skills tests only to pass them then get told they were moving on with someone else.  Even worse was when I didn’t do well, and felt my inferiority.

I am almost embarrassed to admit how many apps I have done.  But it is well into the 400 plus range.  It is brutal and takes a tremendous effect on your psyche.

I still haven’t started the role yet.  However, I wanted to tell everyone sometimes persistence pays off.  My wife cautiously reminded me, but it “worked out” for you.  And “how many try, give up or are still trying.”  Also, the Phrase “insanity is doing something over and over again expecting a different result.”  It is sure what it felt like.

I just want to say, if you didn’t follow a traditional route....College, degree/internship...it is stupid hard.  Others may not think so.  But I rank this as one of the most stressful and challenging things I’ve ever done.  Period.

If anyone wants advice I am willing to provide some.  This community taught me a lot and I want to give back.  I couldn’t even look at it for a while because I just focused on the hustle.  Which I recommend you do the same.",320,75,ClassicHaunting6356,2022-10-06 16:06:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/xx8z4a/data_analyst_first_job/,0,dataanalysis

17g72kg,An update on the list of companies that employ remote data analysts,"Hey guys! 

A few months back, [I posted a list on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/14391e6/i_made_a_list_of_companies_that_employ_remote/) highlighting remote companies that employ data professionals, and the response was pretty great. This got me thinking about the demand for such content, and it motivated me to learn everything about the remote data market.

Because it all started on Reddit, I wanted to do an update post. I've since created a simple website ([www.datanomad.co](http://www.datanomad.co/)) and expanded the company database (I’ve added US remote companies, go check them out!). Moreover, I've discovered even more companies hiring remote data professionals, which I will be adding in the near future. Maybe also Europe, Latin-America, Asia? 

While the company database on the website is useful, a lot of people were wondering which companies were actually hiring. 

So, I started a newsletter in which I’m sending out jobs that I find and am trying to source from employers. 

To be honest, I do not really know yet what listings are the most interesting to subscribers, but I’m working on that.

viupg3,I Finished the Google Data Analytics Program - My Thoughts,"I have many years of data and analyst background. Here's an overall breakdown:

There are 8 sections but really 7 plus a capstone project (optional, I didn't do it) which includes interviewing and resume tips/suggestions. The main tools/skills covered are analytical thinking, problem-solving, Excel, SQL, Tableau, and R. The only thing new to me was R. The rest I have been using for a while now. 

This program provides an excellent foundation for starters. It teaches the basics and how to approach a project or data handling. The interviews with Google Employees provide a nice insight for individuals who are new to the field. 

The program states it takes about 6 months but it's really up to the individual's experience and knowledge. I think it took about 2 months and I was very slow about it too. I watched all the videos at 2x speed. I spent a lot of time on R which was new to me. I completed the certification for resume appeal and to see what Google is teaching. I went through my public county library which offered Coursera online for free. After this, I am planning to take another Coursera course on R and Python. 

Would the certification alone get you a job if you have 0 experience? I personally don't think so. But a nice portfolio or the capstone will definitely help. So if you don't have experience, don't skip out on the capstone. 

Just want to share my experience since there are frequent questions about the Google Data Analytics Program.",257,54,New_Pizza_Rich,2022-06-23 11:28:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/viupg3/i_finished_the_google_data_analytics_program_my/,1,dataanalysis

vl4bus,My suggestion for building a portfolio when you have no work experience,"If you're applying for a first Data Analyst role and have no work experience at all, then it’s very likely you’ll need to create a portfolio to develop and demonstrate your analytical skills. It’s not impossible to land a job without one, but having a good one will improve your chances significantly (in my experience).

It can be tough to know where to start or what projects to develop. You don’t want to waste your time developing something that isn’t effective at landing you a job, either because the portfolio doesn’t demonstrate relevant skills or the projects are very far off base what your potential employers are looking for.

When you’re developing your portfolio, it should ideally do a few things:

* It must help you actually practise data analysis. These take time and practice to develop. The more projects you can do, the better you’ll get and if you are in the fortunate position to be able to develop lots of projects, then you can afford to start revising your early attempts and make them even better.
* It’ll help you feel more confident when you are interviewing, especially if your projects touch on aspects of the roles you’re applying for.
* You develop the skills most relevant to your future first role.

An additional benefit is that you will become more data literate as your practice, so even if you end up taking an interim role while continuing your job hunt, you might find that you can leverage that interim role to start incorporating data analysis into it - further accelerating your skill development and perhaps making it easier to switch to an above-entry level role.

With this mindset in place, how can you optimise your time spent developing these skills?

1. **Pick your target industry**

My suggestion is to first pick an industry in one of two ways:

* One where you already have an area of interest or are really passionate about. Maybe you’ve always liked Sports Analytics, Healthcare, Marketing or something else, or;
* Pick one where most of the jobs seem to be and you feel at least neutral towards it. When you are job searching, take notes of which industry keeps coming up as hiring data analysts. In the case of the Netherlands, these seem to be Banking, Utilities and Ecommerce at the moment. All of these are always hiring for all levels. I say you should at least feel neutral towards it, because I will always advise against going for jobs in industries you just don’t like. I think it could stunt your future growth if you aren’t keen on the work.

By the way, you aren't forever bound to which one you pick. You are free to choose another, but you’ll start off with the cards stacked in your favour and hopefully the first try works out.

**2. Analyse the job ads**

Now that you have a target industry in mind, continue looking at the job ads (both active and expired) and start capturing notes on them. Pen and paper is fine but a google doc that you can later refer to is probably more convenient. Make one main list for this and just keep adding to it every time you look at an ad:

* What **skills** are they looking for? Every time they mention SQL, Power BI etc add a checkmark next to it.
* What **tasks** are they describing? Pick out the key descriptions (usually listed as bullet points of activities) and start figuring out what the pattern is across them. Try group them into themes or clusters.  Even if you don’t know what these are, write them down anyway. You might later learn enough that helps you understand what these tasks are.
* How do they describe their company and the **problems** they’re trying to solve?

**3. Outline your possible projects that optimise for this industry’s profile**

With your **list of skills** in hand, you should be able to see what tools and software to steer towards. 90% of the job ads mention PowerBI and not Tableau, then it makes sense to use PowerBI instead of Tableau.

With the **tasks** grouped and counted, you can focus on projects that demonstrate those that seem to come up the most. If they mention a lot of particular analytical methods, or data cleaning, or geospatial work, or web scraping - then work those into your portfolio wherever possible.

With the **problems or goals they’ve described**, these can be great sources of what business questions to centre your analyses around. Do they talk a lot about customer acquisition? Then do some more research around the problems of customer acquisition and let that form the basis of your analyses.

**4. Search for your datasets**

Now that you’ve got a good idea of the industry and their problems, search for datasets (or create them if possible) that get you close to being able to develop projects that attempt to answer them. If you can’t find exactly what you're looking for (which is very likely), then expand the scope of datasets you can find or alter the possible questions to be able to use what you have found.

This should help you be much more motivated to build a portfolio if it feels like you’re building towards skills you’ll use on Day 1 of the job. Let me know how it goes!

17w7muj,Where Data Analytics Beats Data Science,"When it comes to data-oriented careers, data science is by far the newest and sexiest. (Unless you count Machine Learning / AI as its own separate category.) In fact, plain old data analysts are at the bottom of the data heap, below all of the data engineers, actuaries, econometricians, statisticians, and operations researchers. Data analytics is most commonly seen as a jumping-on point to all of those bigger, better-paid careers, rather than a career worthy of respect in its own right.

But that doesn't mean that data scientists are better at every job than data analysts. When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail; when all you have is a suite of statistical forecasting software, everything looks like a problem that statistical analysis can solve.

My organization recently merged with another department in the corporation. Our department had very little in the way of data science resources; their department had a whole team of them. Naturally, their team was the one put in charge of developing a big, powerful sales forecasting model that could be used to set prices on our products. No problem, right? Except, their team developed and trained the model on the data they had access to, which was based on their sales channels, and the sales channels that were actually going to be *used* were the ones that our department had developed.

Sales channels, that is, aimed at a completely different profile of customers. Now, I might not be a data scientist myself, but I know a few, and one of the big no-nos of data science is developing your model on the wrong dataset. It's like trying to navigate from Brooklyn to Manhattan with a map of Los Angeles. No matter how accurate your map is, no matter whether it has fancy bells and whistles like the ability to track traffic conditions to calculate the shortest route possible in real time, even if it's the most accurate map of Los Angeles ever made... it's still not going to do you any good trying to navigate New York City. So hearing the data scientists' blithe assurances that their model was developed on lots of observations and therefore it would be more accurate than anything developed on our much smaller dataset, I was... skeptical, to say the least.

When the data science department handed over their specifications for the new model to be put into production, it was my data analysts who ran tests on previous customers and proved that things didn't look right, and raised the first red flags. Of course, you can't just kill major initiatives' momentum like that, but when the first customers priced on the new model started seeing prices that were way too high and sales fell off a cliff, it was my data analysts' reports that identified a problem before it cost the company millions. And when the data scientists needed help re-calibrating their model on the right data, it was my analysts who were able to provide it.

So take pride in your work, even if you don't have the newest and sexiest job title around; sure, maybe anybody can stick numbers in excel and turn them into a report. Maybe there's nothing a data analyst can do that a data scientist or actuary or data engineer couldn't. But just because they can stick numbers in excel just as well as you can, doesn't mean they know which numbers are the right ones to use, or what the report means when they're done.

That's my story - I'm curious to hear if other people have experienced the same!",226,46,MiddleAgedMiddleMgr,2023-11-15 23:39:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/17w7muj/where_data_analytics_beats_data_science/,0,dataanalysis

I needed to combine a bunch of file with the same structure today and I pondered if I should do it in PowerShell or Python (I need practice in both).

1bh4q0f,Got My First Data Analyst Job!,"Hello everyone, hope all are well. A couple of months ago I made my first post on here detailing my frustration with job applications. Well, after months of applying, I finally found my first data analyst job!

For context, I have a Bachelor's in Economics and the Google Professional Certificate. My professional background before this was being a teacher. My job right now pays $45.7k, which may sound low, but god am I grateful for just breaking through into the market. I am using skills and tools that are greatly important in the sector, in case I choose to leave my job for a higher-paying one in due time. My job has great benefits and work/life balance, which is the thing I really wanted most of all. I wanted to share my success, and drop some tips and thoughts here as well:

1. **The Professional Certificate course is good and will let you know if data analytics is right for you or not.** Many of the Tableau and Excel lessons taught through that course have been extremely relevant to my day-to-day job tasks.
2. The job market is REALLY tight - you and hundreds of thousands of other people are grinding and competing against each other to join this field. If you're like me and coming from a different industry with only the certificate, it's going to be even harder. **Give it a couple of months for job searching, remember to take breaks, and be graceful with yourself when times seem hopeless.**
3. For applications, be sure to apply intentionally and thoughtfully to positions you truly see yourself enjoying. Don't mass apply or end up in a job you only like because of the compensation - you deserve better than that. **If you're coming from a different sector like me, be sure to use thoughtfully written cover letters to explain your story and decision to transfer to data analytics.**
4. **Many recruiters use AI to help skim resumes (ATS, applicant tracking systems)**. Perhaps reach out to a professional who can help boost your resume and make sure they are ATS-proof and will pass their tests. I reached out to my undergrad career center for this, and it helped immensely.

Some of us are transitioning from careers with terrible work/life balance. Some want to upskill and earn the career that they want. No matter your background, I wish you the best of luck with your journey. It WILL be a journey - the destination to great money with minimal time is a delusion. Anyone trying to sell you that is scamming you. 

Living in this information age is hard enough alone, and most of all I encourage you to respect your humanity, integrity, and time towards making these hard decisions.

xaxvwd,Career Shift / Google Cert Success Story!,"Hello all! I'm excited to share that I've accepted an offer for my very first data analyst job! Here's how it happened...

I spent ten-plus years in the hospitality industry, mostly as a bartender, working at nearly every level from barback to beverage director in both major and smaller markets. The COVID era, along with simply getting older, brought about some serious burnout and an unhealthy lifestyle that I just couldn't maintain. I never saw my family, I was working super long hours, and not getting paid what I was worth.

Back in April I came across the Google Certificate. It immediately spoke to me. I had been working in Excel for years for inventory / costing / tracking profits and so I felt like I had a bit of a leg up. I also had a few close friends who had also transitioned out of the restaurant/bar world into tech and coding and bounced the idea with them and got a lot of encouragement. 

I picked up SQL and R pretty easily as I have an academic background and they basically feel a little like logic puzzles. I turned it into a game! Certificate coursework and query practice became a daily thing and I spent hours at local coffee shops with some lofi beats in the headphones and caffeine in the brain (Spotify has some great playlists designed for coding).

Besides the capstone project, I took a few other courses on Coursera on visualization, Python, and a more intensive SQL course, and all of that helped tremendously. I scoured through open-source dataset websites and found things that piqued my interest and created mini projects for myself.

I started applying and of course got many many many rejections but after a series of interviews with about 4 different companies I got one that seemed to be getting some traction. Although I was mostly interested in remote work, this one was on-site in my city. At first, this disinterested me, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized having a team with me would really help me nourish my newfound skills. Plus, I'm used to working on-site with people I can bounce ideas off of and be challenged by.

After 3 interviews I got an offer! It's a manufacturing company working mostly with Excel and SQL. It's $55k a year, full benefits, PTO, everything. They even have a gym in the office! I'm so excited to get started. I'm also terrified and having all the imposter syndrome feelings that many others I've seen on here deal with. I hope to update soon with some good stories!

One of the best pieces of advice I got early on was to start applying BEFORE you think you're ready. Just start getting a lot of rejections. You'll get used to them. And in the meantime, keep practicing and finding little projects to sink your teeth into. Utilize LinkedIn and the Skills Assessments they have. Put together a really solid cover letter that gives a narrative to your resume, and tweak it slightly for each company you send it to. Emphasize soft skills and do plenty of interview prep. 

Also, don't forget about Excel. It's tempting to go deep into programming languages and everything but a lot of companies still really love Excel. For good reason, too -- it's incredibly powerful and can do so much more than you may think it can. It's the foundation for data-driven business management. The Google Cert doesn't really go into Macros/VBA but take a look into that and you'll see what I mean.

Anyway, thank you for coming to my TED Talk! Wish me luck as I wish you yours!

18641wi,"First ever Data Analyst job offer, but company is (kinda) clueless about the field?","I come from a background in Environmental Engineering, but I developed skills in Data Analysis because of my research field (Meteorology). I learned mainly about Python, with some R and SQL on the side.

Now, I graduated months ago and every application I have sent to do this ""shift"" into Data Analysis has been met with silence. I applied to this company where they required Python, SQL and data visualization skills and after a couple of days they called me and told me they were interested.

I passed the first couple of filters then during an interview with the HR coordinator (it's for people analytics) he told me they all know a bit of Excel here and there but the company is just about a year old and around 3 months ago they realized their data collection and management is a mess (I'm guessing they have a bunch of Excel files from manual input), so they're bringing it a Data Analyst to tiddy it up and provide insights (So you see, they asked for stuff like Python and R but don't actually know how it works - ""code for cool stats and graphs"", or something like that).

That's the thing: I have SOME experience with things like SQL, but I don't know EVERYTHING about it, and have never ever created a database from scratch with real scale data. I was told I seem like a good fit, but would be the only Analyst supporting this process, and they are on the process of sending me the job offer. 

I am really nervous about accepting, mainly because I would have no real mentorship into developing techincal skills and because I fear I could completely fuck up this company's data and be punished for it.

I'm looking for some desperate advice since this is the only offer I've gotten, what should I do?",190,74,None,2023-11-28 19:14:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/18641wi/first_ever_data_analyst_job_offer_but_company_is/,0,dataanalysis
17xt68l,I feel I am a bad fit and need advice,"I was hired as a ""data scientist"" (more of an analyst/engineer) in June 2022. I had one data analyst internship in summer of 2021, but I felt it was lackluster and did not really enjoy it. In graduate school, I learned I enjoy Python programming. I got a MS in Stats, and I decided to apply for data scientist roles.

I have been working in my job for a little over a year. It started well, and I did some SQL on the backend and built two large programs needed. That finished in February 2022. After that, I did not have any big projects until I was assigned my first independent project in June 2022. I had to build a Power BI analytic tool. I used SQL to build a table on the backend and brought my results to Power BI. There was no project deadline, and the data was very messy. Unfortunately, it took me until October 2022 (my manager was frustrated and needed the project in August; this was never communicated). He wrote me a warning letter on my performance. Now, I am on FMLA to take care of my mental health, have been in therapy, and am working part-time.

Today, I shared my work for another project, but my manager is extremely disappointed again and expressed it verbally to me. I started to realize there are things he assumed I should have known, including:

1. When doing left joins on the backend, you have to validate your counts and ensure you know why your results increase or decrease.
2. We are using Hadoop, and I am supposed to know the primary, foreign, and other keys between the tables I join. This info is not shared in Hadoop nor is there a document to reference. When I ask my mentor, he does not always know, so I blindly join the tables (not good, I know now and feel bad).
3. Relation building involves one cross join between two tables.

I did not know these things, and I feel shameful. Nowadays, I have fight or flight dreams from my childhood tied to my manager's behavior, and I think I need to quit my job. Should I apply to data analyst roles or am I not cut out for data? I like SQL and have some Power BI experience now. I do want to become a data engineer within the next few years. I like building/programming things rather than analyzing numbers now.",188,52,need_data_help_plz,2023-11-18 00:05:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/17xt68l/i_feel_i_am_a_bad_fit_and_need_advice/,0,dataanalysis

13bur30,How I Became a Healthcare Data Analyst,"Over the past few weeks, I've seen a lot of folks asking about how to get into data analytics in healthcare. So I'm going to share my long story of how I got into the industry. Then next week (if enough folks are interested), I'll post a roadmap for you to follow whether or not you have pre-existing healthcare knowledge.

When I was an undergrad, I wanted to be a radiologist, which meant preparing for medical school. I took all the pre-reqs and sucked at my science classes and was a Biology major. By the time I graduated, I realized I wasn't quite cut out for medicine, and that to train up to be a competitive med school candidate, I would need to spend tons of money taking MCAT study classes. Maybe doing more science classes in a post-bac. Then I'd have to spend even more $$$ on med school applications.

I decided instead to still persue a career in healthcare, but not as a clinician. But I wasn't sure how.

So before I graduated from undergrad, I took a job as an Epic tutor. This wasn't a job working at Epic, I was a medical scribe at a PNW hospital, showing doctors where things lived in Epic. That was a temporary stint that lasted only 3 months. 

By the time that job was coming to an end, I applied to more jobs, and got hired as a data abstractor. Data abstractors go through medical records to pull pertinent information for quality improvement purposes. So I'd pull things out of a patient's chart like, did this patient develop Sepsis, or Surgical Site Infections after surgery? Did they get pneumonia? were they obese? history of smoking? etc. I would then enter that info into surgical data registries like NSQIP, MBSAQIP,  SCOAP, STS, NCDR, TAVR. 

This is where I started learning Excel, got exposure to medical concepts and terminologies. Learned about different surgeries. I learned about General surgery, OBGYN, Spinal Surgery, Bariatric Surgery, Cardiothoracic Surgery.

I got kind of bored of this after a year, so I applied to a masters in health administration program, and was accepted. So I did this for two years, and gained even more experience in the healthcare industry. And I started to learn how healthcare works as a business. I became known as the data guy in the program, as we had do a lot of finance and stats assignments in Excel. I also learned about Tableau while I was in the program, and so would incorporate those into my presentations and reports.

I realized from that experience though that I loved data, and not management of people, which was what the MHA program was focused on. So I did a couple of things. First, I started learning SQL, and then I also started asking my professors if they knew how I could break into data analytics. One professor directed me to one of his former students who was a director of a data analytics department at a hospital. He introduced me, and I had an informational interview with her.

She liked me, and encouraged me to apply to an open position they had for a clinical quality consultant role. Which was somewhat data oriented. I let her know that I applied, and she granted me an interview.

I prepared for one whole week for that interview, did multiple mock interviews. And as a result, knocked it out of the park. I was hired, did this for 3 months, then the data analyst in that department put in her 2 weeks notice. My boss asked me if I wanted to be the new data analyst, I said yes. Then my predcessor trained me on all the processes that she maintained.

Was a bumpy road for the first year, but I got really comfortable with the tools of the trade, have been doing this for 8 years now, and am currently a Sr. Data Analyst, moving towards Lead.

If I could go back in time, I would have probably done a dual-degree during my undergrad, learning public health and computer science. Then saved myself years of prep work by applying for a data analyst position at a hospital straight out of undergrad. But, eh, live and learn.

TLDR: 

1. Bachelor's Degree (BS in Biology, wish I did Public Health/Comp Sci dual major)
2. Epic Scribe/Tutor
3. Data Abstraction
4. Learned SQL, Tableau, Excel
5. MHA program
6. Networked
7. Got a Job as a Clinical Quality Consultant
8. Made a lateral move into Data Analytics

16sorn9,First job in DA,"Hey everybody. I just wanted to share what I did to change careers and land a job. I have found the stories of others to be extremely helpful and encouraging, I hope this is for someone in this community.

I am a math teacher by trade, having taught for 7 years at various high schools. I also have my masters in mathematics. Last fall, I did a professional certificate with EDX for Data Science to learn how to use different programs.

The most important thing I did, and the biggest piece of advice I can give anyone who is trying to get into DA, is to build a portfolio. Create different projects on stuff you are interested in. Your curiosity will propel you into findings and reports, and you’ll be able to show off your skills and abilities.

Once such project I did was investigated the increase in disciplinary issues in public schools in Florida since 2020 (Covid). Being a teacher and seeing more problems arise, I was curious about this. Plus, I wanted to be a DA in the education or healthcare field. 

This particular project landed me a job interview at a university and ultimately a job offer. 

In this process, I applied to well over 150 jobs and interviewed three times before getting a job offer. It was discouraging and disappointing and I didn’t know if I could make the career change, but in the end I landed what I consider to be a dream job.

Don’t give up! You can do it too.

# 1. General Observations

## Stats

DataAnalyst.com is celebrating being live for 4 months, and we've brought over 1,100 hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site - all of them including a salary range.

There's now 918 people subscribed to the newsletter, and I can't thank you enough for your support and for joining us on the journey.

While in March we've seen just about 3,000 visitors, in April the site grew to over 5,000 monthly visitors across 26,000 pageviews, and we've been able to register approximately 4,000 data analyst applications being started from the site!

This bump is primarily to Google finally taking the site seriously, and after 3 months of sending us no visitors, the site has finally started ranking (for ""data analyst jobs"" search), gaining impressions and clicks, overall accounting for about 20% of this month's visitors.

Super happy to see this, as having multiple channels is crucial to long term growth and protecting the site and traffic from algorithm updates.

SEO game is still a very new topic to me, so I am grateful to couple of people who reached out in previous comments, sharing tips and low hanging fruit for me to address.

## Ongoing challenges - shifting focus to cover United States only for the time being

As I was mentioning over the last 3 months, I am worried that I am not able to effectively cover the UK market any more. Why? Starting with lack of salary transparency, but also the market is largely being operated by recruitment industry, resulting in lower number of direct company listings.

As a solo-founder, prioritization on which activities I spend time is crucial, and since I am committed to my approach to only have job listings with salary posted, I decided to pause my coverage of the UK market for the time being.

All in all, I simply realised that I wouldn't be able to consistently add quality data analyst jobs for the individual market, which would eventually lead to poor job seeker experience.

As the site grows, I will look to expand the team, and eventually have more bandwidth to cover the UK and other international markets.

I certainly hope that DataAnalyst.com will still be able to provide value even to out-of-the-US data analysts - be it with market insights, expert interviews, or with guides and other education material that we have in the roadmap.

## Slow and steady - building partnerships

Something that I have touched upon in my update last time - we still haven't had any paid posts published on the site. Over the last 4 months, there's been very little done to reach out to HR departments of companies and to educate them about DataAnalyst existence, and our proposition. The primary reason is that I'd still like to see the traffic numbers improve, so when I do speak to those accountable for hiring, I could build the case of us being able to bring them qualified leads, much easier.

In March, I was super excited to share the news that we've been cooperating with a data startup (an alternative to Snowflake that's fast, simple to use, and open source), to bring them qualified candidates, and to help them build out their data team.

Well, in April, I witnessed first hand the power of community, of bringing people along on the journey and putting yourself out there.

Huge shout out and thank you to Maggie who writes the Data Storyteller newsletter, which she sends out every couple of weeks. Not only she highlighted DataAnalyst.com to her audience few times, but when a hiring manager from Michelin reached out to her about promoting a job, she connected us instead. Fast forward, and over the next couple of weeks I'll be speaking with Michelin' talent acquisition team, and figuring out a way how Data Analyst can bring qualified candidates and help them build out their data teams.

This is another huge milestone toward the overall goal - to continue developing trusted partnerships with organisations, to bring more expert interviews, and data analyst job opportunities on our site, for all of you to learn from and explore.

## Some fixes

I've integrated a ""Search by Anything"" filter into the job feed - you can now search by company name, location (including the state), industry but also a specific role focus - just try it! (Warning - it's highly experimental).

# 2. Data Analyst Job Market Insights (monthly)

As the amount of job opportunities on the site grows, we're utilising the data available to bringing you the fourth (April) edition of Market Insights - a deep dive into the data analyst job market, where we can have a look at the job openings and provide you all with insights on the latest hiring trends for the past month in the US market

With the insights I'm trying to bring answers to questions such as: Which industries are hiring the most? Are we seeing any salary increases? And what about the remote working trend?

I can totally see that at least at the start, this will not be extensive enough to highlight any trends, but I do believe that doing this on a monthly basis, it is something that will provide value over the long term to those looking for roles - the more data points we collect, the more insights we can uncover.

***For the US, April edition, you can see the full report*** [***here.***](https://www.dataanalyst.com/blog/april-2023-market-insights-data-analyst-jobs-in-the-united-states)

# 3. ""Day in the Life"" - a series of interviews with data analysts sharing their experience, thoughts and advice.

The next edition of our ""Day in the life of a Data Analyst"" is out, and this time we spoke with Elijah, who's currently working at Humana. 

We chat about his experience, as well as dip our toes into what seems to be on the mind of pretty much everyone right now: Is AI/Chat GPT a threat to data analysts?

Golden gem - his advice for those aspiring to enter the industry:

*""Build portfolios. This is especially important in the absence of a college degree. With or without a degree, a portfolio is the best way to prove you have used SQL, Tableau, etc. in an applied context. This step is incredibly important. Don’t skip it.""*

Highly recommend reading the [**full interview**](https://www.dataanalyst.com/blog/elijah-my-data-analyst-career-journey)**.**

For our next interview, we'll be speaking with **Tisha, who's a Data Analyst at Tesla**, and we'll be aiming to publish it on **Thursday, May 13th.**

# Things in the pipeline

* New data analyst jobs, added daily
* Actually launching the weekly newsletter with the pick of best jobs directly to your inbox (yes, I know....)
* Monthly US data analyst market insights
* Improving the overall site experience (this one is a never ending activity)
* Continuing to bring you Data Analysts across their experience levels, to share tips, tricks and their thoughts
* Tested a feature that would allow visitors to report an expired job posting - it broke, trying to find a fix

17nqx7p,Next Wave of Hot Data Analysis Tools?,"I’m an older guy, learning and doing data analysis since the 1980s. I have a technology forecasting question for the data analysis hotshots of today.

As context, I am an econometrics Stata user, who most recently (e.g., 2012-2019) self-learned visualization (Tableau), using AI/ML data analytics tools, Python, R, and the like. I view those toolsets as state of the art. I’m a professor, and those data tools are what we all seem to be promoting to students today.

However, I’m woefully aware that the toolset state-of-the-art usually has about a 10-year running room. So, my question is: 

Assuming one has a mastery of the above, what emerging tool or programming language or approach or methodology would you recommend training in today to be a hotshot data analyst in 2033? What toolsets will enable one to have a solid career for the next 20-30 years?",168,51,PropensityScore,2023-11-04 17:44:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/17nqx7p/next_wave_of_hot_data_analysis_tools/,0,dataanalysis
nn5yu7,How I got my dream job in 5 years starting from no experience.,"I see a lot of posts in general from people starting out and trying to figure out how to advance - what they need to learn and what they don't need to learn.

I've put in a lot of work on my own path and feel I am at the point where I can at least share my journey which I hope can be of some use to those who are just starting out.

I'm not here to brag, only offer insight from one person's journey hoping it may help someone.

I now make 100k in the midwest and work as a data engineer/analyst.

I am available to answer any questions.

TLDR at bottom.

&#x200B;

**My Background:**

Midwest.

Graduated in 2016 with bachelors in Sociology.

I learned absolutely no technical skills in college and had almost no idea of what data analytics was or what I wanted to do. I knew no sql, python, or even excel for the most part.

&#x200B;

# First Job

*Title = Product data specialist. $10/hour*

**How I got my first job**

(no skills test)

All I did was search ""data"" on Linked In, hit ""easy apply"" and took the first job that called me. The interview was beyond simple and I was told I was hired because the interviewer ""liked me"". The point here is, SMILE, be engaging, be human, in addition to everything else.

It was $10 an hour doing basically data entry. It didn't even require excel in my initial role. I took pdfs of product sheets and typed the information into the company backend.

**How I grew within the company**

I discovered pretty quickly that when I'm getting paid I have a strong desire to fix all the stupid things and inefficiencies and inconsistencies around me. That's mostly what I did. Without being asked, I created documentation of our processes. I created formalized excel templates. Since I'm lazy, I eventually learned a little VBA and sped up some manual copy/pasting type stuff in excel. It was a small company and they quickly had me filling in work in two other departments, one of which was completely unrelated. I was told it was because I was a ""fast learner"".

**Key Takeaways:**

Even a low paying, simple job at a small company can have incredible opportunity if you LOOK for it and just do things without being asked. Superiors notice quickly because apparently most people don't take initiative to improve things or learn without being told.

**Skills Update**

I learned excel and a little bit of VBA on the job but also spent time learning excel outside of the job - really digging into understanding formulas more.

&#x200B;

# Second Job

*Title = Reporting analyst, promoted to sr. data analyst. 42k/47k salary + 5-7k annual weekend work.*

**How I got my second job**

(no skills test)

Now I was a little smarter and expanded by search criteria to include ""analyst"". I found a company I liked and spent two hours on a very tailored cover letter. I don't know how much that improved my chances but I feel it helped. I spent probably 4 hours researching the company and preparing for the interview. I still didn't have much technical skill, but the job I was applying for only required excel and sql, I already had excel. I sold myself mostly on my ability to learn quickly and improve things quickly. I had a lot of energy and brought a friendly demeanor. These always help but I feel especially when you don't have much else to lean on.

**How I grew within the company**

At this job I discovered I have a high level of curiosity. I was given full read access to the entire companies databases (small company). I began doing my own analysis on questions I had like ""is it possible to predict which of our ads will perform better before we launch them?"" Through this, I taught myself python, r, machine learning basics and took it upon myself to give a presentation of the results. Most of this was done on my own time outside of work. But this got me immediately promoted.

Additionally, I used VBA to improve our excel work. I learned python and api usage to speed up our reporting. I took it upon myself to roll some python automation out to another team. All told, I had helped save thousands of hours of work on a yearly basis. It was a startup, no one was worried about being replaced because we were actually doing real work and there was always more work to do. I took it upon myself to teach an analysis class in R to about 15 coworkers, after having taught it to myself. I learned a bit of javascript to create google sheets automation, which we used heavily.

I took the machine learning and deep learning specializations on coursera.

And in my own time I began taking on complex python projects (extracting midi from an acoustic piano using raspberry pies, a script that would create templatized youtube videos, etc).

The bottom line is I worked my ass off and probably worked 40 hours a week at the job + 20-30 hours a week outside of work learning and teaching myself. The way I saw it, this was an investment in my future. The faster I upped my skills the faster I could make more money. And I wouldn't have to work like that forever, only until I got to where I wanted to go.

Learning coding was not easy for me, especially with no real-life teacher. I often thought I wasn't capable of it and I wasn't smart like ""those other people"". I do feel I'm slower to pick things up than other people, but I overcame this mostly because there were so many questions I wanted to answer and systems I wanted to automate that I forced myself to learn what I needed to learn to do what I wanted to do.

**Key Takeaways**

Don't be afraid to spend time learning outside of work and outside of school. You'll outpace almost everyone if you do. Take initiative within your company to improve things without being asked. Also, be friendly. And if you feel you aren't smart enough, hey, I felt like I was a dummy for a long time. I didn't do well in school. But I eventually made it. If you keep working hard (in my case, really hard) and efficiently, it's almost impossible not to improve.

**Skills Update**

Python, R, Sql, excel, vba, some javascript, good basic understanding of machine learning.

&#x200B;

# Third Job

*Title = Business Analyst. 67k*

**How I got my third job**

(no skills test)

This one was a mess. I wanted to get into data science but I found out I didn't have enough hard skills in that area. I wanted to continue growing in a more challenging role so I took an analyst role at a mega corporation, but the company I worked for had almost no work for me to do. It was horribly run and i hated every second of it. Eventually I left. I quit with absolutely no job prospects lined up and without even being actively interviewing anywhere. I had a couple months money saved up.

**Key Takeaways**

Don't stick with a job you hate.

**Skills Update**

No change.

&#x200B;

# Fourth (current) Job

*Title = Data Scientist (but do the work of an engineer/analyst) 72k as contractor, then 92k when promoted to full time with 10k annual bonus.*

**How I got my fourth job**

(skills test was writing 1 query and creating a pandas dataframe)

The biggest things that helped me here were: 1) I had done so many personal projects and taken such initiative on my own and they really liked that (some companies really don't seem to care about that though). 2) When they asked me a question I didn't fully understand, I asked for clarification before answering it. I learned later this was a huge deal in their minds and also learned a lot of people don't do this. 3) I also asked a lot of questions. That's important as well, especially in a higher level role where they need to know you're able to use your own brain and figure things out. That's very correlated to being able to ask high quality questions.

**How I grew within the company**

I have stood out in this position the same as previous positions: I improve poor quality systems where I can. Let the team know generally about design weaknesses that I see. Create documentation where the is none. Do things without being asked. Question why things are done the way they are. Put in 110% effort and make sure everything I put out is high quality. I find that even at a higher level, a lot of people still don't put in as much effort into their work as I would expect. Put in a lot of effort, continue learning and you will stand out.

&#x200B;

# TDLR

* No amount of experience is too small to get started in the field. Wherever you're at now, start learning and progressing.
* You don't HAVE to go back to school to start in the field. Start learning on your own. You don't even need to pay for classes online or do a bootcamp. I never did. But I worked hard.
* Opportunities for growth will probably not be handed to you. Find them. Create them. And implement them on your own. Don't wait for permission (if it's something simple, like a team-process enhancement)
* Do high quality work. Every time. Never be lazy in your quality of work.
* Question why things are done the way they are, particularly if you have better suggestions or see an obvious flaw. I haven't personally worked for companies that aren't receptive toward improvements.
* Work your ass off by:
   * Learning on your free time and doing things at work that further your skills and up your quality of work. This is an investment in yourself.
   * Don't kill yourself in a job that demands a lot from you but isn't improving your skillset or paying you like crazy.
* Don't waste time learning things that won't be useful to you. There are too many distractions. Stay focused. Do only what brings you the most value. I only ever focused on learning tools that would help me where I was at, not where I wanted to go in my ""next job"".
* You may increase your salary in a shorter timescale by job/company hopping than by staying in one job.
* If you feel like you're too dumb to do this work, don't worry too much. I felt incredibly dumb for a long time, but I pushed forward in spite of it.
* Technical skill doesn't make up for other deficiencies. I have seen highly technical people who lacked business sense, lacked curiosity, lacked social skills, lacked interview skills, lacked self-awareness - to their detriment. Inspect your own weaknesses and improve. Always improve.
* Excel/sql/python/pandas are definitely at the top of the list for being useful in this field. Along with tableau/powerBI. Pandas doesn't have much value in getting you a job because somehow a lot of companies aren't terribly aware of it, but has been invaluable for making my life easier within my roles.
* I feel the best trait to be a good data analyst is enjoying distilling structure from ambiguity. And you need a high level of detail orientedness. I developed this trait over time.
* Follow the [golden rules of data analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H2gqi_2InEC2iqwqavj8ig0xrG4izax7DFrjMgI3kfA/edit?usp=sharing)
* Follow these [interview tips](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1suVRIbYJLsC4-KW9dmJqU8JDREg48OodO0whfDi_B9k/edit?usp=sharing)",166,20,None,2021-05-28 19:47:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/nn5yu7/how_i_got_my_dream_job_in_5_years_starting_from/,0,dataanalysis

90% of the job is done in Excel, because it's a small company with very little data to work with.

Despite having a masters from an analytics program at a university, I basically can never get a decent data job.

My skills are shit, and frankly everything seems too damn hard to learn. Trying to do SQL problems on stratasearch is just completely demoralizing, because it highlights how little I know. My skills in R and Python have atrophied too much, and attempting to learn that stuff again just seems completely overwhelming.

My company is trying to pigeon hole me into doing QA work because they realized after hiring me that there is very little work to do with data here. Trying to find a new job seems like a fruitless endeavor, because I simply am not skilled enough and the job market is awful.

18c4n18,DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the summary of how it's going after the 11th month,"Hi all,

on Dec 19th I launched [DataAnalyst.com](https://dataanalyst.com) \- this is the 11th update, covering performance for November, with hopefully many more to come.

DataAnalyst.com has now been live for just over 11 months, and we've brought over 1,550 hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site - all of them including a salary range.

Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on.

While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/DataAnalysis might benefit from the site, especially those looking for a new data analyst job. I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey.

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.

Let's dive right in:

# 1. General Observations

## The tale of two halves.

*Twas the first half of November, and the traffic never been so high,*

*but it all disappeared one day, in a blink of an eye.*

*as Thanksgiving approached, visitors did depart,*

*leaving behind pageviews, an abandoned art.*

*The analytics weeped, as stats took a fall,*

*a virtual ghost town, no visitors at all.*

*So, my dear job board, be patient, get through the night,*

*and await the return of the digital light.*

**TLDR: first two weeks highest traffic ever, then everyone went away, to stuff the turkey and themselves with some treats**

Another part to this was Google giveth and Google taketh away, and if DA was ranking in the top 15 results for the last month, after recent updates it's down to 40th+ place.

It clearly shows the importance of diversifying traffic acquisition channels, and yet again, the importance of a memorable, descriptive and ""on topic"" domain name. Whatever Google does, there's still been over 3,000 people who typed in the domain and came directly.

**Where did 7,600 people come from?**

* Organic - 52%
* Direct - 40%

As I've mentioned before, I launched BusinessAnalyst.com - where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over the last 11 months with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infrastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (after-all, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa).

Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any consistent revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck.

While as mentioned above, the lack of revenue is concerning, I'm mainly raising eyebrows about the lack of progress I'm seeing with BusinessAnalyst, as shared in the previous update as well.

I've created the site with all the learnings from DataAnalyst - automations, site structure, on-page SEO + programmatic pages, automated social media, filters, Google schema and job posting distribution.

What the heck is going on there? Is there's some sort of penalty on the domain? Have Google updates been aggressively punishing the site?

I fully understand that the demand for data analyst roles, and data analyst as a career path has skyrocketed in recent years, which likely drives the interest in DataAnalyst site, but the difference should not be that drastic.

What it also doesn't explain is the lack of results from the SEO side. Scratching my head.

Anyone any ideas?

# 3. Day in a life of a Data Analyst, with SJ, Ani and Muthalib

Hopefully end of year also means some quiet time for all of you.

To scratch your productive itch over this period, we brought you 3 interviews to read. All sharing extremely interesting journeys, with truly unique perspectives being offered in each case.

I highly recommend reading all three interviews in full. The real life evidence of achieving goals through determination, resilience and going one step further than most are willing to do.

## From business owner, to absolutely loving his data analyst role, with SJ

Originally, SJ ran a successful small business for almost two decades, then COVID hit and things shifted. He feels like what he did is completely opposite of what you see people on social media doing. Most people work an 8-5 and dream of working on their own. He had the business, loved it… but it was time for a change.

There was a particular point that I wanted to highlight from SJ's experience.

*""Towards the end of my initial interview, my (current) boss asked me if I had ever just read code to see what it was doing. He explained that they have a bunch of code, so I wouldn’t always be writing new SQL, but changing, adapting old code. I hadn’t done that, and I said that… but, while I had no experience up to that point actively interpreted SQL code, I fell back on my experience with my small business; I was always looking at the metrics I had available to see what worked, whether that be a social media ad or a picture… why one was successful while others were not. I explained this in the interview and we continued on. At the conclusion of the interview, I was given no indication that I would move to another round….*

*I wanted this job and made the conscience decision to actively go after it.*

*That night I went home, and found several examples of SQL code- I then deciphered what it meant and wrote up summaries of what each code did. I sent this to him along with other examples of my portfolio. It was this action that landed me a second interview. The fact that I was proactive, did a little bit more work based on our conversations and sent it to him without being asked. See, they weren’t looking for someone who was just a data order taker, they wanted someone who would go out find the data pain points for people and get them the data they needed.""*

What really stood out, was what he did after the first interview for the role - taking the time after the interview, finding some example of code, and with a summary shared it back with the interviewer.

**98 out of 100 people will NOT do that.**

[Full interview with SJ](https://www.dataanalyst.com/blog/sj-my-data-analyst-career-journey)

## Starting career as frontline agent, and growing into the director for analytics role, with Ani

In our second interview, we spoke with Ani, who's career spans 18 years, beginning with a hands-on tech support role as a frontline agent. From being a self-taught analyst to advancing to Director of Product Analytics, he's now the founder of Framework Garage Consulting, where his passion lies in elevating analytical maturity for his clients and coaching analysts.

Something that's not just specific to data analysts, but it's universal across different career paths, is career progression toward leadership roles.

Just because one is a brilliant individual contributor, it doesn’t necessarily mean they will be a great team/leader. As Ani says, **leadership requires a very different skillset and many forget to hone it on their way.**

*""However, remember that being an exceptional analyst does not automatically qualify you for leadership. The transition to a leadership role involves acquiring a different skill set—strategic thinking, people management, and a broader business understanding. Demonstrating these skills, such as your business acumen, your proposals for solving problems, and the tangible impact of your work, is crucial. These experiences illustrate your leadership potential, not just your analytical expertise. If your pitch is about how excellent you are as an analyst, then you are walking into a conversation about growing as an analyst. Showcase your readiness for the next role.*

*Leadership is about influence, impact, and decision-making. It’s about being in charge of your team, their careers, personal growth, and development as much as professional achievements. Crafting a narrative that convincingly showcases your readiness for leadership is key to setting yourself up for success.""*

## From being a Dentist, to a data analyst role at a healthcare company, with Muthalib

In our last interview, we spoke with Muthalib - he studied at a dental school in 2019 and worked as a dentist until 2020 before moving to states, where he did Masters in Medical Informatics.

In another great story of persistence, he did volunteer work for over 12 months to showcase his interest and loyalty as a health data management intern. This followed by landing a data analyst job as well as having the company sponsor his visa.

As evident from our last three conversations, he's shared something that all 3 people had in common - none started their careers in the data analyst role:

*""Don't try to only focus on data analyst positions. Focus on any title that uses these technologies. That way you may have an upper hand. Your primary goal is to land a job. From there you can switch to your career if interested.""*

I'm a data analyst that has been in the industry for a 8+ years now. I'm an online instructor and content creator and I also teach short courses in data analytics at a tertiary institution.  You can search databudd on google to find out more.

**What is in it for you:**

* Access to my courses I've created  (Free obviously). There are courses on Excel, Python and Tableau that can be accessed through Udemy.
* Interview prep - I've interviewed many data analysts and can you give you tips on how to improve
* Resume prep - We can also work on your resume
* Project assistance for your portfolio - We can work together to create a practical and interesting porfolio
* Group sessions with other mentees to discuss progress etc.

**Why am I doing this all for free?**

* Well, I do have my own business and eventually I want to monetize this into a more formal program but I don't want to do this without actually testing if it works/ or is beneficial.

At the moment, I can take on 5 - 10 people for the next 3 months.

17g284e,Two years of being a data analyst from a non technical background,"Hello everyone! 

For everyone from a non technical background who wants to get into data analytics here’s a story: 

In college I studied biology and minored in CS. My parents forced me to study biology and after a point I couldn’t take it anymore. I decided to take control of my own life and live on my own terms. I decided to change my career into something I’m passionate about. I loved working in my research lab as a data analyst and decided to work towards that. Unfortunately I didn’t have the luxuries to take another two years in college due to the expense and decide to just do a minor. 

Currently I am working at a well known company and I wanted to share my thoughts here: 

1. When I first started as a data analyst, I was in a very different field (marketing data analytics) and since it was a junior position I didn’t have a lot of impact however my manager taught me well and because of her I was able to improve my skills. I’m still in touch with her :) 
2. When I switched jobs I came into this extremely high stress environment which has even kept me up on the weekends but the impact is very large that’s why I’m so scared to fuck up. 
3. I always feel that since I came from a non technical major I’m at a disadvantage but then I think that so many people applied to this position but they chose me so it doesn’t matter how old you are, how many degrees you have. If you show them that you are innovative, hard working that’s all they care about. 
4. In this field skills always need to be up to date so I highly recommend to keep taking courses and move into an area where you are the subject matter expertise and use data analytics as a tool or go into data science to have skills to make you irreplaceable. Unfortunately in this industry layoffs happen every now and then :(",143,37,Intelligent_Cow_4567,2023-10-25 11:07:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/17g284e/two_years_of_being_a_data_analyst_from_a_non/,0,dataanalysis

zauu9a,Finally got an Entry-Level Data Analyst job!,"So after months of searching, I've finally got my first associate Data Analyst job!

Little back story...

I recently graduated in May (Finance and Information Systems), and was working for this company in a year long graduate rotation program. Through the program I was working through different departments such as :

1. FP&A

2. Data Analysis

3. FP&A again (someone going on maternity leave)

4. Accounting.

After my first rotation with FP&A, I went to my boss and said basically that I wanted to go to another department for my 3rd rotation because I didn't think FP&A was for me. Little did I know that because of this, they said they are using my headcount to hire someone to fill that role for the person going on maternity leave. Basically it felt like they wanted to use me as a cheap option and that they were planning on me doing FP&A all along for them in the long term, when I originally did a rotation to figure out what I want to do professionally. Along with this, my experience with the rotation has been awful through 5 months... most of the time I've had nothing to do, and have been trying to teach myself Data Analyst skills while taking courses to keep myself busy.

They said I am not continuing my rotation, and that I have to find a full-time job with them immediately or leave the company. It never sat right with me that they did this, so I wanted to leave and prove them wrong. I had until they hired someone to make a decision, and I got the job before they did thank god.

Data Analysis was always something for me that sounded interesting, but I knew it was hard to get an entry level role. After a couple months of applying, practicing online, and interview prepping, I FINALLY got a role after having two online interviews, and one in-person.

I can't wait to give my former company my notice on Monday, and I couldn't be more excited to come into this field.",140,16,BuckyMcFly99,2022-12-02 19:18:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/zauu9a/finally_got_an_entrylevel_data_analyst_job/,0,dataanalysis

17qepjz,What is usually tested in a SQL /Python/Excel interview?,"I am just starting out in data analysis professionally and am interviewing for this position. I read online that this company conducted a surprise  ""tech"" interview on someone and they did not do well. The job requirements state that a mastery of SQL and Excel is required and that the job entails statistical analysis, creating models, forecasting different paths, and creating reports. It also says that Python is a ""nice to have"". I know Python, SQL, and Excel but now I'm sort of nervous because I don't have the code for statistics/regressions/visualization memorized in Python and I'm pretty sure it does not even exist in SQL. Usually I have to look things up so I get the syntax right. Like for example, say I want to do a logistic regression in Python; I do not know the command off the top of my head. Obviously, I do have the basics memorized like selecting, grouping, aggregating in SQL, some pandas things in Python, and the common formulas in Excel. Do people actually have these things memorized? Are they going to be testing in the interview whether I can program something very specific with no internet? I thought that they only tested the basics, but after reading that one person's experience I'm not so sure because they said the reason they didn't pass was because they had to do the code on a Mac, which they aren't used to. I'm having trouble imagining what type of code would be different on a Mac versus any other type of computer/operating system. So I'm just wondering what everyone's experience is with these types of interviews. It appears to be an entry level position only requiring two years of experience.

Update for posterity/anyone wondering the same: So I actually made it to that third tech interview and the assessment ended up being take home, SQL and Excel. 

I ended up using window functions, joins, where clause, and subquery/ctes. Also dates were everywhere.

It was hard primarily because I had to make up my own tables and create them to test my code and also because I wasn't extremely familiar with that industry's type of data so understanding the question took longer. He said I could have a couple hours but it shouldn't take me more than 1. It took me 2.5.... It was on sheets and docs too so they can see I worked the whole time. I'll admit I took a significant amount of time to format things nicely and wasn't in much of a hurry; didn't want to ask chatgpt because I figured all the other candidates would and I don't want to have code identical to theirs. Now I kinda wish I did because this company is my top choice (by which I mean none of the other ones I'm interviewing for come anywhere close to them). Kind of feel like I blew it. 

So yeah I guess my advice to anyone in that situation would be to look up examples of data from that industry and familiarize yourself with it and practice window functions.

Today I had my very first data analytics interview for an entry level data analyst job and I just wanted to say how useful the course is for those wishing to get into an entry level role. 

Thanks to the course I was prepared for the general questions on why data is important, what is data analytics etc. 

As someone entering the industry, it's given me a lot more confidence in the wider picture, beyond the technical element. 

I'm not going to say that the certification got me the interview, I doubt that's the case, but it certainly prepared me for the questions. 

I would recommend it.",134,21,Prestigious-Delay916,2021-08-17 15:52:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/p66kjd/google_data_analytics_feedback/,0,dataanalysis
12lyue5,Review of Google Advanced Data Analysis Certificate Program,"The Advanced program is great as a whole. You work on a ton of different projects throughout the course. The course is practically 100% Python. definitely more data science than data analytics focused, but they adopt the perspective of ""data professional"" which encompasses both fields. Here's the breakdown: 

Course 1 -- Learning About Data Science in general. its a good introduction to the field and pretty thorough. 

Course 2 -- Learning Python Basics. definitely take your time on this unit, especially if you are new to Python environment like I was. You really need to do the labs on your own without referencing the cheat sheet because you need to get familiar with the basics before you move onto more advanced stuff. really good stuff in this course, similar to a bootcamp/crash course style of learning. highly recommend download anaconda and python on your own, and using jupyter notebooks on your own machine rather than through the virtual labs. 

Course 3 -- this is the best course from the program in my opinion. all about exploratory data analysis, best practices procedure wise as how to do EDA, a little bit of Tableau. really great instructor. 

Course 4 -- statistics. this is the worst course from the program in my opinion because it kinda covers really basic stuff you should already know before getting into the program ie) hypothesis testings, what probability is, etc. i come from an econometrics background so i practically just did the labs from this course and skipped the videos and stuff. you do work on an A/B testing project, which is nice. but again, its basically just hypothesis testing and testing for statistical significance. really basic. 

Course 5 -- regression analysis. again, something i am deeply familiar with given my background. but really good unit. covers linear and logistic regression methods and how to interpret coefficients. covers some more advanced statistical concepts too like anova analysis, chi-square test, and other tests. if you aren't familiar with these concepts already, definitely take your time here. its a lot thrown at you at once. the most math heavy course from the program. 

Course 6 -- machine learning. personally, im completely new to this subject. it was interesting albeit not necessary ultimately. this just felt like an ancillary course added on for the heck of it. for 99% of people, machine learning isn't something you won't be doing day to day in the field. you work on some cool projects though via naive bayes methods. you do some stuff with decision trees as well. 

Course 7 -- capstone, combining all the stuff you learned throughout the program into a singular project. learning about resumes, interviewing, job prospects, etc. 

Overall Review: great program. definitely would recommend. 

who should take this program? people who completed the first program, people who already have a good foundation when it comes to statistics and data science, or people early in their career in the field. people who are already experienced probably wont get much out of this program other than something to put on a resume and some portfolio projects. 

who should not take this program? people who lack the foundation in statistics and coding in general. i knew a little bit about coding from R from the previous certificate program & personal projects. also knew a good bit of SAS and STATA from my education. its easier to learn a new language once you already have a good foundation in some others. a lot of the syntax or skills are transferrable. but ppl lacking any coding background will likely struggle. same for people who have never taken a stats course. ppl trying to skip steps going straight to the advanced cert rather than the basic one as well will struggle as well more than likely bc they will lack that foundational knowledge. 

Best part of program: frequent projects, i added a bunch of different projects to my personal portfolio of work. learning at your own pace is nice too. they provide you with example code in the labs too, so if you get stuck you can refer to the example. i wouldn't recommend just copying and pasting though from the example because you wont really learn that way. ultimately, its about learning. putting the cert on your resume is just another benefit but the real benefit is actually learning ""how to do"" data science.",133,34,CamxThexMan3,2023-04-14 14:19:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/12lyue5/review_of_google_advanced_data_analysis/,0,dataanalysis

# 1. General Observations

## Stats

Google impressions and clicks are accelerating, with organic traffic outperforming direct for the first time since the launch. I know there's been multiple Google SEO updates over the last month, but not sure how much of an impact it actually had. I'm attributing the increase to my efforts over the summer to clean up on-page SEO (but that's just a hunch)

I'd be greatful if someone could please explain to me Google Search Console Clicks vs Google Analytics Visitors - shouldn't each click that comes from Google Search, leading to the site, also mean that's a visitor coming in?

**Where did 4,552 people come from?**

* Organic - 42.8%
* Direct - 42.2%
* Social - 12% (automated job postings on Twitter, Linkedin, Reddit, FB/IG)
* Referral - 3% (honestly no idea where that's coming from)

Also worth noting that Google Analytics finally gave up on the site, and I'll need to shift to GA4. Expecting tons of issues and inconsistencies, since I've been running GA4 in parallel, and none of the numbers line up with GA.

## Things on top of my mind

**a) Ads & Affiliates**

I'll put my commercial hat on for this part here - and really open to feedback and thoughts from people who have experience in this field, as I'm starting to unpack this topic.

When I was preparing to launch the site, I knew ads & affiliate partnerships as a revenue stream would be an option, but it wasn't an option that I actively pursued nor considered. Personally, I use ad blocks myself, but I do understand that in certain cases, advertising and affiliate partnerships can do good for all parties - the site owner, visitors and advertisers.

A very simplistic view of this world is that aspiring and professional data analysts are an extremely valuable audience.

On the entry level side, people are usually driven, bright, in higher level education and searching  for an edge how to enter the in demand and well paid industry. (Target audience for bootcamps, course and certification providers)

On the experienced level, these are people with higher salaries, disposable income, and at a managerial level also in many cases decision makes on what tools, conferences etc their division/team/company runs. (Target audience for tools, platforms and other tech providers as they are building up and scaling their propositions + leadership level certifications and coaching)

As the site keeps growing, over the last few weeks I've had several companies (across both segments) reaching out, and inquiring about options to advertise on the site.

My response was that I don't really have an advertising proposition defined yet, but when I do, I want it to be transparent and meaningful to all parties involved (now and in the future).

What I do know, is that I don't really want to have the site filled with various ads and affiliate links.

What I don't know, is what those terms & conditions should look like in the case where I go exclusive (with 1 or 2 advertisers) for longer period of times.

Doing some initial research on other advertising platforms, if we take the segment of bootcamps/courses/certifications, the top 5 advertising organisations pay upwards of $100,000 a month on Google ads, to reach (imho) minuscule appx 16,000 clicks combined ($6.25 cpc) , on targeting audience searching for ""data analytics / data analyst + courses / certification / bootcamp""

Now, now, don't compare yourself to Google, I get that.

At the same time, the people visiting DataAnalyst ARE the exact audience these companies are trying to reach, all on one site + directly reachable and responsive through a growing newsletter.

It is something that I need to really shape going forward, but as it stands, ads were never really my intended primary revenue stream, and I'm not really looking to make rash decisions just for a couple of $.

I don't have this one figured out yet, and I am trying to do research + data driven approach, but if anyone has direct experience and ideas, please do reach out, would love to learn.

**b) Spray and Pray University outreach**

I mentioned in last months' update that I noticed quite a few .edu emails signed up to the Newsletter. Thought it could be an interesting angle to explore, reaching out to universities, sharing that their students are using the site. I was hoping this would lead to both driving in visitors, as well as potentially getting a backlink that would help increase the authority of the site.

Well, that's a lot easier to say, than to achieve, and I've classified my efforts as a surprisingly spectacular fiasco - altho as a retrospective, it couldn't have ended in any other way.

Why?

Well, I found a .xls spreadsheet online, with approximately 1,700 educational institutions in the US and their admissions' email address.

Mistake #1 - timing - I thought with Universities/Colleges starting in September, it would be a good time to get on their radar - just as they new students coming in and discovering what those institutions have to offer. Truth is, it's also the time when you have an enormous amount of freshers spamming the admissions office looking for directions to their dorms.

Mistake #2 - audience - on the topic of admissions office - they do not care of anyone reaching out to build partnerships, literally, that's probably the last thing on their mind.

Put the two together, and I ended up with 2 (thanks but no thanks) replies out of appx 800 emails sent. Silver lining - the email still had appx 50% open rate, so no harm done to email deliverability (spam score).

Good idea, awful execution, but it did provide me guidance for my next steps. Will repeat the process, this time however looking at .edu backlinks at some of the similar job-boards, and directly reaching out to the institutions' career centres.

## BusinessAnalyst.com

As I've mentioned before, I recently launched BusinessAnalyst.com - where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over the last 9 months with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infrastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (after-all, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa). Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any consistent revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck.

**TLDR update**: Still dead, but slowly starting to see signs of life

# 2. Data Analyst Salary guide update

As you've probably noticed, a lot of time over the last few months has been spent on updating the data analyst salary guide.

While there have certainly been positive steps made in the legislation toward salary transparency, there's currently only 9 states (with New York being the latest) currently requiring employers to disclose to job applicants how much a position pays.

Job seekers across industries are in most cases put in a position where they have no idea about the compensation prior to making time for interviews, case studies and other shenanigans - that's one of the reasons why I am so adamant on only having job opportunities with salaries on the site (and yes, I admit, there are cases where the salary range listed is bigger than King Kong's first dump of the day - brownie points for those who get the reference).

Now, back to the salary guide.

With approximately 1,350 data analyst jobs listed on the site up to this date, in the salary guide and respective pages, you can now find the following breakdown:

**Industry** \- breakdown by specific industry, overall minimum, maximum, median and average salary + salary breakdown by years of experience

**Years of experience** \- breakdown of all jobs on the site by years of experience - entry level (0 - 3 years), senior (3 - 5 years), lead (5+ years)

**State** \- this is where it gets tricky. Now, as it usually is with this kind of exercise, lumping the data all together you come up with an insane range. On the other hand, if you split the data in 52 different ways, you'll get a whole different set of issues where N is not large enough to draw any conclusions - and for some states, there's simply no data at all (not to single any state out, but I'm looking at you, Wyoming).

As an experiment (and primarily targeting SEO benefits) I've also included average data analyst salaries at all the **companies** that are listed on the site. Truth be told, it's probably a useless metric, but I am hoping to rank for some of the long tail ""what is a data analyst salary at X"" keyword searches.

As the site grows, and the number of jobs on the site increases, I do still believe that I'll be able to bring an addition source of information about salaries, complimenting those already available on other sites.

So far I've done this quarterly, with the next update expected in January to close off the year, and will move to 2x year updates starting in 2024.

As a side note, I am considering releasing the full database of jobs on the site (for 2023) in January. This could probably provide some value, as anyone can deep dive and analyze for themselves (for example what are most in demand skills, qualifications etc.). It could be an interesting data analysis project to showcase in a portfolio, or if you're having troubles falling asleep.

If that's something of interest, please send me a message and happy to collaborate in sharing the insights back with the community.

181hi9a,Should I take this new job?,"Should I take this new job?

I graduated in 2022 with a degree in Math and CS.

Currently work as a business analyst for a tech company in the DC Area earning 60k. I exclusively use Excel and Power BI. Oftentimes find it boring because I like coding(Python), but no one else on my team knows how to, so no one can take over when I’m on vacation or leave the company. I should also note that it’s just me and my manager responsible for the data on my team. So if I take this new position, I will be leaving him by himself.

I got an offer to join the Business intelligence team in this same company to be a Data Analyst. This position would have much more responsibility with project management, and it would be mainly in SQL. I don’t have much experience with SQL but want to learn since most analytics positions require it. The interviewing team told me that they expect it to take 6mo  for me to be fully comfortable in the role and be self sufficient. 

The offer is only 70k, and I don’t think I can negotiate since they know exactly how much I’m making now and my experience. 

The issue is that my fiancé is in the military and we will be moving next summer across the country.

Would it be unethical of me to take this position, for only a small salary bump, but really good experience - when I already know I will be leaving the company in 6-9 months?",129,52,HeavyExample7701,2023-11-22 19:30:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/181hi9a/should_i_take_this_new_job/,0,dataanalysis

11blobr,Honest Review of Google Analytics Certificate,"I am about done with my capstone project in the final course of the Google Analytics Certification Process. I was a Planning and Analysis Manager a decade ago and took the course to get back into being a Data Analyst after a decade in marketing, martial arts, travel, and other projects. I found that my personality and skillset are best suited for working more on my own as an analyst.

I took the course to brush up on my skills and learn new ones. I watched a number of Youtube videos on how great the course is for getting into Data Analytics. Most of those videos have affiliate marketing links and aren't an unbiased take on the course and many of the people making reviews likely didn't take the course.

Here are some of my thoughts and observations.

The course says it takes 240 hours to complete. I think it could be done in 80 to 100 hours while watching all the videos in each course, doing the learning logs, practice problems, and capstone. If you are a college student on break, just bite the bullet and knock it out in 2 to 3 weeks. If you are a full-time professional, put in 10 hours a week and knock it out in 2 months.

If you are new to data analysis, the background, thought process, how to present findings, ideas, and career advice are very helpful. You can get much of the same advice from other online sources as well. If you have experience, you are basically doing the course for the certificate and picking up some new tricks and tips.

The technical aspects on Excel are solid. The Tableau, SQL and R are very basic. Anybody who takes the course as a beginner will need to learn a lot more Tableau, Excel, SQL, R or Python in order to really prepare themselves for a data analyst role. Also, depending on field, AWS, Salesforce, Google Analytics Tags, etc.

I have seen some people on here post their gripes about the course. Its a great start, almost like a Data Analytics 101 class, but then you have to challenge yourself to take the 200, 300 and 400 level classes in Tableau, Python, R, SQL, and Excel to build upon that foundation. Networking and building a portfolio are important as well. As you learn something new in SQL, or tableau take on a new project while the learning is fresh and pop it up on your portfolio.

The certificate and course aren't a silver bullet or magical. Its just the initial foundation that will require a lot more time, energy and work to learn, build a portfolio, networking, and apply for jobs. Its just the start, not even close to the finish.

Also, I looked at the job postings within the Google Data Analytics job site. Most of the jobs aren't entry level and a number of them require Bachelors or Masters in STEM fields. I am not sure they would really consider a non-college grad with just the certificate.",131,42,Aggravating-Mind-657,2023-02-25 14:00:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/11blobr/honest_review_of_google_analytics_certificate/,0,dataanalysis

# General Observations

While in January we've seen over around 800 visitors, in February the site grew to over 3,200 monthly visitors across 16,300 pageviews, and we've been able to register approximately 2,300 data analyst applications being started from the site!

&nbsp;

For those of you visiting the site, you may have noticed that Europe region is no longer being covered, and the site is now purely US & UK focused. There were couple of reasons for that. First, salary transparency is non-existent in most European markets. Second, out of those jobs that were posted and included salary, majority of them would be in the local language. All in all, I simply realised that I wouldn't be able to consistently add quality data analyst jobs for the individual market, which would eventually lead to poor job seeker experience - simply put, if there aren't quality enough listings being added over the course of the week, you'll extremely likely not to come back.

&nbsp;

There is also little bit of a worry about the UK market for similar reasons - lack of salary transparency, but also the market is largely being operated by recruitment industry, resulting in lower number of direct company listings. I am committed to my approach to only have job listings with salary posted, so will need to monitor over the next few months if the time spent on the UK is worthwhile, particularly by a solo founder with limited time on my hands. 

&nbsp;

While not directly related to the site, through the whole process I did make an extremely important realization. It's actually not that surprising, it's pretty obvious, but once I started writing newsletters, blog posts, as well as these summaries, it became painfully clear: 

&nbsp;

**I need to learn how to write better.**

&nbsp;

Effective writing is a critical aspect of being able to properly communicate to inform, influence, entertain, evoke emotions and create a connection with the reader. 

Not only that, but good writing fosters good thinking that follows a certain logic, a story, a narrative, which is easy for others to follow. Writing out what you want to communicate forces you to organize your thoughts. On top of it, the more you write about a subject, the more you understand it, and you are then able to communicate your point of view in a much clearer way. 

&nbsp;

As the world keeps moving toward digital, as we continue shifting toward remote work and async communication, effective writing becomes a superpower.

# Data Analyst Job Market Insights (monthly)


As mentioned last month, we're utilising the data available to creating Market Insights - a deep dive into the data analyst job market, where we can have a look at the job openings and provide you all with insights on the latest hiring trends for the past month in the US and UK markets - with January and February editions available on the site. 

&nbsp;

With the insights I'm trying to bring answers to questions such as: Which industries are hiring the most? Are we seeing any salary increases? And what about the remote working trend?

&nbsp;

I can totally see that at least at the start, this will not be extensive enough to highlight any trends, but I do believe that doing this on a monthly basis, it is something that will provide value over the long term to those looking for roles - the more data points we collect, the more insights we can uncover.


# Things in the pipeline


- New data analyst jobs, added daily
- Actually launching the newsletter with the pick of best jobs directly to your inbox (yes, I know....)
- Monthly market insights (for the US & the UK market)
- Improving the overall site experience (this one is a never ending activity)

### Next up: 
""Day in the Life"" - a series of interviews with data analysts sharing their experience, thoughts and advice. 

&nbsp;
 
We'll be sharing the **first interview next week, 9th March**, and it will be with **Eddie (he's also a Redditor), who is a Clinical Data Manager for a pharma/biotech company**! 


# Building in public - how sharing the journey on Reddit got 45k views


One of my favourite subreddits is r/dataisbeautiful - I find it amazing how talented some people are, being able to gather data from all over the place, structure it, and visualise it in a way that it tells a story so simple, yet so captivating.

&nbsp;

Building in public is scary, it doesn't (probably) get easier - it is however a huge opportunity to learn something new, improve your work, and grow.

&nbsp;

With that in mind, I decided to publicly share my journey of building Data Analyst on Reddit. As most of you probably know, you never know which way the comments section is gonna go, so I was understandably nervous.

&nbsp;

The feedback however was overwhelmingly positive, and the post racked up over 45k views. 

&nbsp;

I'm incredibly thankful for all of you who interacted with the post and shared your thoughts. I read through and replied to all the comments, and decided to do a wrap up of the experience in a post - summarizing the most asked questions, tech stack as well as added some general thoughts. I won't link here, but you can find the full post on the site/blog. 

# Add On: Domains, domains, domains

There was a lot of questions and comments about the domain name, and in general, when people consider starting a project, the importance of the domain name is one of the most frequent topics discussed. 

&nbsp;

While I won't be sharing the exact cost, here are some of my thoughts: 

&nbsp;

What I can say is that I've been building a portfolio of domains over the last 5 years, as I do believe that they are the key to growing a successful (not just online) business. 

&nbsp;

There were couple of reasons for going with the exact match .com domain:

1. **Instant credibility** - I've started talking to some HR departments, and once I introduce myself and what I am operating, they pretty much don't question my intentions at all. This doesn't just apply to conversations with companies, but also to anyone who comes across the domain - it will help me shape, attract and help the people in the niche.

2. I'm a firm believer in **""Start as you mean to go on""** - in this case, fully committing to the project and planning for success.

3. There's absolute tons of reasons why this experiment might fail, but the **domain is a long term asset** in fast growing industry / job role - no matter what happens with the site, the **domain name will hold value over the long term.**

10r5eve,Announcement: Limiting Posts Related to Career Entry to a Monthly Megathread,"## Announcement

Hello Data Folks! 

In order to allow this subreddit to flourish and in order to better help everyone, we are now limiting career-entry (_“How do I get into data analysis?”_), resume-feedback (_“How can I improve my resume?”_), and certification (_“What course should I take?”_) questions, where the focus is on individualized advice, to a monthly megathread. Going forward, moderators will remove posts where the focus is general career-entry and resume-feedback for individuals, redirecting those making the post to the megathread. 

## Background & Rationale

### Community Feedback

Six months ago, [we sought feedback on what to do with regard to questions focused on career entry](https://old.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/w20v9f/should_rdataanalysis_limit_how_do_i_become_a_data/) in this subreddit. The results were less clear-cut than we had hoped, with the subreddit’s participants split between continuing to allow _""How do I become a Data Analyst?""_ questions (42%) to various options for their discontinuance (58%). The top option among those favouring the discontinuance of _""How do I become a Data Analyst?""_ questions was to redirect them to a megathread.

In order **to sustain a healthy community** here, change is needed, even if some do not agree. Reflecting on that survey, in addition to many comments within as well as sent to modmail, we mods believe this is worth trying. No change is permanent, and we will re-evaluate the situation within the next 12 months. But we have reasons to believe it will help and will improve the subreddit for all participants.  

### Maintaining Balance

Many topics that are (or should be) central to r/dataanalysis are generally being drowned out by the high volume of **questions related to career-entry, training, and resumes**. The outcome is a kind of [“Eternal September”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) effect — the influx of new and inexperienced participants asking basic questions — resulting in a perpetual reduction in quality of conversations and a shift of focus away from the subject itself as other matters become drowned out and diluted.

This subreddit isn’t the data analysis equivalent of r/cscareerquestions, but rather meant to fully be r/dataanalysis. We want everyone here to be able to enjoy this subreddit as a community which is relevant to them and their interest in the core of data analysis.

### Focusing Help

**This is not to say that either these questions or new and inexperienced participants are unwelcome; far from it.** We want to _include_ you. But inclusion should not result in the exclusion of others. And past practices here are not beneficial to you, either. Rather than 100 people asking the same or similar questions in separate places we want to bring you together to maximize the benefit. Separate questions reduce the benefit to those 100 different people because it dilutes the response and exhausts those who want to help! Many have suggested, “just search previous answers”, however [Reddit’s search function is underpowered to say the least](https://i.imgur.com/Oh2YlGa.gif).

The better answer is to concentrate and concatenate those questions. Additionally, having a monthly thread means that those who ask for help might not just have their question visible for a few hours. Your question will be in a thread which is pinned for a month and linked in subsequent months. 

We would ask that those with expertise or willingness to share ideas still drop by these threads to offer feedback. Welcome newcomers and offer advice! 

## What does this cover?

If you have a **question** or are **seeking out feedback** along any of these lines:

-   _“How do I get into data analysis?”_ as a job or career.
-   _“What courses should I take?”_ 
-   _“What certification will help me get a job?”_
-   _“How can I improve my resume?”_
-   _“Can someone review my portfolio / project / GitHub?”_
-   _“Can my degree in …….. get me a job in data analysis?”_
-   _“What questions will they ask in an interview?”_
    
… take it to [the megathread!](https://old.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/10r5f3f/megathread_how_to_get_into_data_analysis/)

Especially if the question is focused on you and your career, as an individual. 

## What this doesn't cover

This doesn’t exclude you from making a detailed post about _how **you** got a job doing data analysis_. It’s great to have examples of how people have achieved success in the field. Give lots of details while maintaining your privacy.

It also does not prevent you from creating a post to _share your data & visualization projects_. Showing off a project in its final stages is permitted and encouraged.

## Future Plans

This is just a first step. There have been suggestions from community members that we should utilize Reddit’s wiki function to build a FAQ. If you are interested in helping to build that, [please reach out to us via modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/dataanalysis). And for other concerns as well, please [send comments to modmail](https://tenor.com/view/business-cat-working-cat-boss-angry-gif-13655998). We may not reply, but we will read constructive feedback and we are open to ideas.

17pwcfc,New at Data Analytics and Struggling,"Hi everyone,

As you could probably guess from the title, I am a new data analyst who primarily uses excel and sql for my job. I am struggling with meeting deadlines for alot of my reports and am getting increasingly concerned. For a little bit of context, sometimes my coworkers don't meet deadlines as well and I am scared that this is something that happens constantly with my work. It eventually gets in their hands but I just wanted to ask if its normal for report to be delayed because of problems arise while doing the report that wasn't accounted for/is it okay to acknowledge that it will take me longer to do  some reporting so as long as the client gets it and is a bit late? I would opt to work on the weekends but I am super busy most of the time.

1456cav,DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the summary of how it's going after the fifth month,"Hi all,

on Dec 19th I launched [DataAnalyst.com](https://dataanalyst.com) - this is the fifth (May) update of hopefully many more to come. 

Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on.

While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/DataAnalysis might benefit from the site, especially those looking for a new data analyst job. I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey.

If it's not something that belong here, have absolutely no issues to take the post down and / or keep the updates to a different subreddit.

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.

Let's dive right in: 
&nbsp;

# 1. General Observations

###Stats
DataAnalyst.com has been online for just over 5 months and we've brought over 1,250 hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site - all of them including a salary range.

There's now 1,200+ people subscribed to the newsletter, and I can't thank you enough for your support and for joining us on the journey. 

While in April the site grew to just over 5,000 monthly visitors across 26,000 pageviews, in May we've been able to cross the 5,000 visitors yet again, with over 28,000 pageviews - not only that, we registered approximately 4,500 data analyst applications being started from the site!

Additionally, I've also had multiple people reaching out, both in comment section of my previous updates, but also in DMs, sharing that they have found the site to be extremely useful in their job search, and that they were able to get interviews and onboard new roles through the site - I absolutely love this, and even if the venture doesn't end up being commercially successful, I'm super happy to hear that it has indeed helped people when needed. 

**Google impressions** are over 50% up, albeit the amount of people clicking through to the site remained flat. 

On the positive note - the site has finally ranking for all the major target keywords:

""data analyst jobs / data analyst job / data analyst / data analytics jobs""

Pumped about this, as having multiple channels is crucial to long term growth and protecting the site and traffic from algorithm updates.

###Things that happened
a) Expired Listings - 
There's feedback regarding some of the jobs on the site already expiring and leading to non-existing listings. I am trying to come up with a solution where visitors would be able to upvote/downvote and thus highlighting status for everyone else. For now, I went through job listings and marked those roles no longer open as ""Expired"".

b) Product Hunt launch - Early last month I decided to share DataAnalyst on Product Hunt. The idea wasn't necessarily to try and rank up to the top, but mainly get the site out there, and gain a backlink from ProduntHunt that's going to help the site's authority. Overall the voting process is extremely cumbersome, but we did end up with 36 upvotes which was more than I expected.

###Expecting a summer slump
With summer, there's typically very little hiring happening / it's extremely slow as people are taking well deserved time off. I'm expecting activity on the site to decrease, and my main goal for this period is getting together a plan of action to start reaching out to companies in Q4 and Q1, educate them about the site, the value proposition and hopefully get a few partnerships on the books. 

What that will look like, I honestly have no idea, but experiment, iterate and go again.

Some of you may have noticed that I've also recently launched [BusinessAnalyst.com](https://bussinessanalyst.com) - where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over the last 5 months with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (afterall, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa). Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck. Anyways, how this will work out is a case study for another time. 

# 2. The Salary Guide 

On a monthly basis, we've been utilising the data available to developing and sharing Market Insights - a deep dive into the data analyst job market, where we can have a look at the job openings and provide you all with insights on the latest hiring trends in the United States.

With these insights I'm trying to bring answers to questions such as: Which industries are hiring the most? Are we seeing any salary increases? And what about the remote working trend?

With that in mind, I'm excited to share that the first five months of insights were consolidated, and **[the Salary Guide](https://www.dataanalyst.com/salary-guide)** has now been published. 

The data analyst salary guide provides the overview of salaries in various industries - and now also shows a more detailed view on each industry page, with a deep dive into how much entry level, senior and lead data analysts can earn depending on their experience.

This is only based on job opportunities on the site, and no external data sources are utilised. The plan is to have it updated quarterly, with the next update in September. 

For the US, we've also released the May edition of Market Insights, you can see the full report [here.](https://www.dataanalyst.com/blog/may-2023-market-insights-data-analyst-jobs-in-the-united-states)

# 3. ""Day in the Life"" - a series of interviews with data analysts sharing their experience, thoughts and advice. 

The third interview from our series has been published. In these interviews, we aim to share stories and experiences about the route to becoming a data analyst, keeping up with the skillset, recommendations to aspiring data analysts and much more.

Tisha, who is a data analyst at Tesla, has shared some fantastic insights, and I'd love to highlight couple of my favourite quotes from the interview.

On what she loves about being a data analyst:

*""For me, the most exciting aspect of being a data analyst is the opportunity to unlock meaningful insights from vast amounts of data. I enjoy the challenge of uncovering patterns, identifying trends, and translating complex data into actionable recommendations. The ability to make a tangible impact on business outcomes and help organizations drive growth is incredibly rewarding.""*

On her advice for those aspiring to enter the industry, she shares 6 points that everyone should focus on:

1. Acquire a strong foundation in SQL. This is an essential tool for data analysis and manipulation.
2. Familiarize yourself with data analytics tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Alteryx. Demonstrating proficiency in these tools can enhance your employability.
3. Seek out internships, projects, or volunteer opportunities where you can gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets and analytical challenges.
4. Continuously enhance your skills by staying updated with the latest trends and best practices in the field. Online courses, webinars, and industry conferences can be valuable resources.
5. Showcase your skills and projects through a portfolio or personal website. This allows potential employers to see your capabilities and the impact you can make.
6. Network with professionals in the data industry through events, online communities, and LinkedIn. Building connections can lead to valuable opportunities and mentorship.


We've also touched upon the Question of the Year: Is AI/Chat GPT a threat to data analysts?

Highly recommend reading the **[full interview](https://www.dataanalyst.com/blog/tisha-my-data-analyst-career-journey).**

14419dx,Want to get a data analysis or related job? Here are some things to keep in mind.," A bit about my background. I've been working in some data related field for about a decade now. I've worked in logistics, defense and tech. I've done operations analysis, budget analysis and decision support analysis. I've also been in leadership, technical and support staff roles. I've recently helped in hiring and recruiting, but I'm not a recruiter or a hiring manager.

I provided these tips in a post a while back and I think it's worthwhile to put it into a post.  


1. Experience and domain knowledge is king. Work experience and projects are the first thing I look at, because it's usually the only thing that was really different from resume to resume. The main thing I looked for was outcome - did your analysis work/project inform important decisions? Did it provide insight into some process or measure? Did it find anomalies, discrepancies or gaps? etc. 
2. Education matters. The resumes I saw already went through a first or second cut. Every resume I saw had at least a bachelors, predominantly with STEM degrees, I'd say at least half had masters and a sprinkling had PhDs. I honestly didn't pay much attention to the education portion and it didn't have much effect on my decision to reject or pass on.
3. Most DAs are internal hires. The resumes I looked at were all external. I can't say for sure, but I believe that internal applicants went through a more streamlined process. Most of the people I work with (including myself) are internal hires/transfers. 
4. Reputation and networking is extremely important. I understand that not everyone will have a reputation or a robust network, especially those that are starting out, but if you want an advantage, you need to develop and leverage your network and build a good reputation. 
5. Certs don't mean much, if anything at all, at least not by themselves. There are some certs that are stand outs, i.e. PE, PMP, CISSP, CEH, etc. but those are very industry and job specific, and if you have one of those certs it's highly likely that you have some work experience and domain knowledge that goes with it, which will be far more interesting than simply having the cert.

If you've read this far, the final and most important tip I have is: don't get discouraged and don't give up, but set some realistic expectations. Analysts are support type jobs, we are mainly consultants and advisors, we don't make a sellable product or make decisions about an organization. We inform, illuminate and advise. Technical skills are important, but what's more important is to know your industry, sector, business and stakeholders (especially their priorities). I've seen my fair share of new hotshot analysts present beautiful and complex analyses that are irrelevant, inconsequential and sometimes even misleading. This is one of the main reasons why DA is generally not considered an entry level job. If you want the best chance of breaking into DA, figure out the industry/sector/business you want to work in and learn about it, or better yet, get a job in it. We need more analysts, there's so much demand for data driven analysis, but too few of us that know how to properly provide it.",117,50,F00lioh,2023-06-08 06:19:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/14419dx/want_to_get_a_data_analysis_or_related_job_here/,0,dataanalysis

19fifre,Career change success story!!,"  

Hi all,

I see a lot of doomer posts of people unable to land interviews or being turned down even when they get interviews. I was just offered a position as a logistics data analyst and I thought I'd share my story to give some people hope and to give some tips for how I was able to transition careers. Some background on me: I have a bachelor’s degree in applied mathematics. When I finished college I had no internships or experience in anything really so I just applied to everything I could and eventually got a position in an administrative role in logistics. In the beginning I was satisfied just to have a job but I quickly realized all the lost potential of my degree. So I decided to focus on trying to become a data analyst. Took me around 3 months to learn SQL, Python, Tableau, and I had on the job experience learning excel. From there I took data from my department and started analyzing it on my own. I requested access to Microsoft SQL server for an analysis project and I also started automating certain tedious aspects of my job using excel. This way I got real world experience in data analysis. From there I worked on projects in Python, SQL, and Tableau. I worked on three large projects that would really show off my prowess in the programs. After those were done, I started applying for jobs. Initially, I applied for all kinds of data analysis jobs but got a very poor callback rate. So I changed my approach and tried applying to data analyst jobs in fields related to my job in logistics. Things like supply chain analyst, demand planning analyst, logistics data analyst, etc. I also changed my resume to highlight my experience analyzing data at my current job. After I did all that, within the first two weeks I had 4 callbacks. 3 of those calls ended up in an interview. 2 of those 3 interviews progressed to a 2nd round interview. Of those two 2nd round interviews I was just offered a job for one of them and I haven’t even had my 2nd, 2nd round interview yet!

All this is to say that a career change is definitely possible. It takes a lot of hard work and dedication. You also have to find clever ways to get real world experience, but it is definitely possible. I hope I was able to inject some hope and give some useful tips. If anyone has some other questions, I am willing to answer some. 

EDIT: 
Hello all,
I've been getting various DMs asking about resume, portfolio, and interview advice. I thought I should just add that information to my original post for everyone to see. 

Firstly, resume wise for the formatting I used ""Jakes Resume"". Here is a link: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs
I didn't mention it in my original post but I slightly edited my resume for each job I was applying to, to give a higher chance for a callback. My understanding is that a hiring manager will give each resume a 5 second glance and in those 5 seconds you need to show the hiring manager why you would be worth a callback. Customizing each resume specifically to the job you are applying to increases this chance.

Secondly, for portfolio there are tons of examples out there if you just Google but my advice is to cater your projects to the industry/department you will be applying to. For example one of my projects was an inventory analysis on Tableau. I analyzed KPIs from old inventory data of a real company and created a pretty dashboard. I also used Python to forecast possible future inventory needs. This project was specifically catered for logistics. 

Finally, in terms of interview I researched each company so I was super knowledgeable on exactly what they needed before the interview even started. I also made sure to have some knowledge on all of the duties listed on the job description and how my current work would translate to those duties.

10q93tk,DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the summary of how it's going after the first month,"Hi all, 

on Dec 19th I launched [DataAnalyst.com!](https://DataAnalyst.com) - this is the first update (hopefully many more to come).

Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on.


While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/DataAnalysis might benefit from the site, especially those looking for a new job. 

I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey. 

If it's not something that belong here, have absolutely no issues to take the post down and / or keep the updates to a different subreddit.

**Early stages vision** is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.


Where I would like to see this going - my **long term vision**, is building a community of aspiring and professional data enthusiasts. A place for those who love data to collaborate, share, learn and develop their careers.


So, let's dive right in.


######**Statistics for January, 2023**

Number of jobs posted: 269 (United States: 208, United Kingdom: 45, Europe: 16)

Paid job posts: 0 (although currently, some jobs were featured free of charge as they coming from my ex-Google network)

Users: 795

Total ""Apply Now"" clicks: 634 (only data available for the last 3 weeks)

Avg. session duration: 3min 52sec

Pageviews: 4100

Avg. time on page:  1m 35sec

Returning visitors: 17.7%

Total Google Impressions: 410 


#General observations: 

- It's hard to find jobs with salaries - atrocious in Europe, US is better due to salary transparency laws in certain states, but even then we're looking at a range bigger than King Kong's first dump of the day 
- UK is much more ""Recruiter agency"" driven - most of the data analyst jobs are being posted by a 3rd party, rather than directly by companies' own HR.  
- As I'm hand picking jobs from various sources, noticed a lot of jobs which have had 100+ applicants are being reopened - what does that mean? Not enough quality candidates in those 100? Are companies just hoarding CVs?

###Thoughts: 
Overall I'm pretty happy about the progress so far, probably actually exceeding my expectations. Even though my initial announcement (19th Dec) mainly attracted my friends / colleagues, the site is getting some traffic through direct type-ins, Twitter and LinkedIn engagements. 

What is more important for me is that I can see visitors spending time on the site, clicking through job posts, and some are actually coming back to check out what's new. 

Something that's annoying me (and most likely also is annoying visitors to the site) is that currently the site is very much US focused, there's no doubt about that. Multiple factors in play - from agency postings in the UK, job being posted in local language, to absolute lack of salaries available in the EU. This obviously has a trickle down effect - imagine you're looking for a data analyst role in France, confirm your filters and you'll see one job - well, that might be an extra job you haven't applied yet, but if there aren't further quality enough listings being added over the course of the week, you'll extremely likely not to come back.

Could that be solved by posting jobs without a salary - yes, it probably could and it would definitely increase the amount of jobs posted for a certain country, on the other hand, I hate not knowing what the salary range is when applying myself. 

Another option would be only focusing on the US market in the initial stages, but I am really not sure how I feel about that.

The site is still extremely fresh, so will monitor behaviours for the first 3 months and make a decision then. 


#Things in the pipeline:

- Monthly Data Analyst jobs Hiring Insights - which industries are hiring, salary trends - watch out, January edition coming this week!
- The complete data analyst guide (how to become a data analyst, career path, responsibilities and skills...)
- Day of a data analyst (people in the industry sharing their journey)
- Launch the newsletter - honestly this should be much higher on my to do list, but really out of my depth to automate it
- Start reaching out to HR / job posters directly



######**So, there are 3 ways you could get involved:**

1. Looking for a new challenge? Check out the website - I'm adding new jobs daily

2. Looking to hire a data analyst to your team? Shoot me a message on Reddit (or alex@dataanalyst.com) and I'll upgrade your first listing for free!

3. I'm in early stages of creating a ""Day of a Data Analyst"" section - if you're open to do an email based interview about your data analyst career journey (and be one of the first featured), just send me a message and we'll organise something.

16gsdwt,Feeling like a Failure,"Hi everyone, 

I just don't know what to do, so I wanted to post this here and see what you all think. 

I was recently hired by a company as a data analyst. I was on contract with them for a year, and now I'm a full time employee as a junior analyst. Anyway, a project I was handed has absolutely blown up and I can't help but think I'm a failure. 

I was given a project to report company financial data to our deputy CFO. I was tasked with gathering requirements, building views in Snowflake, validating the data, and creating a dashboard. I was put on this project alone as a junior analyst, but the parent company asked for this and it's very important, so I was thrust into it. Anyway, I've discovered that we cannot meet the deadline because of several issues:

1. We base our validation on existing reports, but several of the reports conflict with each other and nobody has determined which reports are right. 
2. There are several issues with ETL. Bridge tables missing data, poor population of fields, etc. 
3. Some business logic is very poorly defined and isn't written down anywhere. 

I feel awful because I'm being blamed for not catching these issues earlier. This is a critical job and it's about to fail. I don't think I should have been placed on such a critical project alone as a junior analyst, and validating the ETL team's work was never part of my job description. Is this normal? Should I enter a different industry?",111,41,Immunittty,2023-09-12 14:09:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/16gsdwt/feeling_like_a_failure/,0,dataanalysis

13cxiw5,Encouragement: You WILL Get an Interview (If You're Adapting/Improving),"Hey all,

Like a lot of people on this sub, I'm pivoting into DA with a Google certificate, a portfolio of work, and a dream of gainful employment.

I landed my first interview yesterday for a junior DA role after \~2 months of regularly applying to jobs, and I just wanted to let other folks know that it can/will happen to you too if you don't go into auto-pilot mode as you apply.

For me, the breakthrough was when I finally got over myself and chopped my 2-page resume into a single, concise page. I had worked with a resume writer who insisted on a two-pager, despite my reservations. I don't think it was a coincidence that I started getting traction once I made that change.

Basically, if your current strategy and tools aren't working for you...change them. Think critically about how you're presenting yourself and to whom. Get outside opinions, and don't stop practicing your skills while you apply.

Every ""Thank you for applying to \_\_. Unfortunately..."" email is a data point that you can and should use to enhance your job hunt.

zzqdwo,Why is the Google Data Analytics certification viewed so positively?,"I saw it getting a lot of hype and positive coverage from websites and YouTubers, so I gave it a go, and out of all the Coursera courses I've done, this was easily the most useless.

People said it would take 200 hours, but I finished it in one day. I didn't watch most of the videos, I just skipped ahead to the quizzes hoping eventually I would find the ""technical part"" of the course, but there was none. The quizzes were mostly about using common sense and behaving professionally, with a tiny bit of spreadsheet/SQL/R syntax sprinkled in.

I thought it would be something that really would build up core skills for data science, but it has basically zero Maths/Stats theory and doesn't have a single Programming assignment.

I don't see how this qualification is viewed in such a positive light. It lacks any proper assignments for developing actual useful technical skills or a theoretical foundation for Data Science and Machine Learning.

All the other data science Coursera courses I did (Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, Mathematics for Machine Learning specialization by Imperial College London, Applied Data Science in Python by University of Michigan) I felt challenged and was learning practical skills and theory.

16upzpj,What do you like about being a data analyst?,"Background: I am a former teacher. When I was preparing to leave education, I spent months working on data analyst courses. When the time came to interview, I was overcome by mad imposter syndrome and found the job listings very intimidating. I ended up get a job as an instructional designer with a healthcare company. 

Now, this healthcare company has several departments with data analysts. I feel like I have a great opportunity to get my foot in the door here. So I’ve been networking and meeting analysts. I reached out to one connection about shadowing someone in her department. She talked to her boss (the director), and they will work to arrange it. The boss man would also like to meet me! I’m a little nervous because I believe they have had an open position for almost a year now. 

I feel like he is going to ask me why I’m interested in data analytics and my top reasons are salary increase, work life balance, etc. I should probably have some better reasons! I do like the scope of the work from what I learned in my courses. But I’m curious to know what analysts actually like about their jobs???",103,33,zebracakesfordays,2023-09-28 20:03:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/16upzpj/what_do_you_like_about_being_a_data_analyst/,0,dataanalysis
xl3pe2,I’m back again with another tip for aspiring analysts :),"My background: I’m coming up on 3 YOE as a BI analyst, and I got into this field with no formal education in analytics. My BS is in business, and I have an MBA as well. 

I see a lot of posts here about which technical skills to learn, and that’s great and extremely important, but I wanted to add on something that I don’t see being discussed very often. In my opinion and experience, when getting jobs in this field, it’s really beneficial to have an understanding of business concepts as well. Employers have generally been pretty willing to overlook some technical skills I needed to gain experience in because they also value my business knowledge. 

Having an understanding of the principles of finance, accounting, marketing, etc has been so advantageous for me, and it can really set a candidate apart from other applicants when searching for a job. When I got my first job in this field, I only had a very rudimentary understanding of SQL and had never used a visualization tool, but my boss told me he was willing to take a chance on me because he valued my business understanding so much. 

Having technical skills is great! But IME, adding on these business concepts can help you convey the value your work can provide to the business, as well as give you much more context for the problems you’re trying to solve. It helps a lot to be able to talk about these things in an interview. (As an example: Even just being able to explain the differences between profit, margin, cost of goods sold, return on assets, break even points, etc has provided much benefit to me.) 

I just think it’s something not discussed very often here when talking about what skills to work on, but it’s an important part of a well-rounded skillset!",103,27,hollow_asyoufigured,2022-09-22 14:58:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/xl3pe2/im_back_again_with_another_tip_for_aspiring/,0,dataanalysis
wkf0o3,Confused on Data Analysis Career Path,"I started off learning about data analysis through Googles Data Analytics Certificate program on Coursera. I felt like it gave me a pretty solid foundation but knew I would have to build on it, and that it wouldn’t alone get me a job. Since then I’ve done a few case studies, some just taking clean data and analyzing and visualizing it, and some starting by gathering the data and cleaning it myself. I have experience with Tableau, Excel, Sheets, SQL, Python, R, and feel pretty comfortable using all of these. I have a portfolio showcasing what I can do for work. I have six years of experience working in healthcare and a bachelor’s degree, but I can’t land a job in data analysis. 


So far I’ve only had one interview, and it was for a pretty low paying position, but most of the interview questions were about machine learning algorithms (which I know nothing about). I am unsure if this is par for the course (I figure it’s not and they were trying to get a data scientist for the price of an underpaid junior data analyst).

I don’t know where to go from here. I’ve been doing the courses on Kaggle to learn about machine learning, although I do understand they do not cover the theory behind machine learning and more the implementation of it. I am not sure where to go from here in my learning journey, and don’t know why I am having such a hard time with landing an interview.

zull8f,Got an analysis job!,"Hello everyone! 

Background: I have a degree in biology, and during peak pandemic I decided I didn’t want to go to med school. 

Recently I finished a data analysis internship at FANG where I learned basic python and tableau. Post internship, I sharped both of those skills and have been studying SQL.

I recently got a job where I’ll be doing IT Analysis. I’ll be building computers and installing them in health care settings around the country, then analyzing the data we get. We will be using SQL, Hex, Tableau and basic python. 

I think this is a good halfway point into becoming a data analyst. Next year, I hope to be a full on data analyst.

Update: how I got the internship at FANG. I used to work Apple retail, and they have internships just for retail employees (in addition to non retail employees) to allow retail employees experience corporate and for corporate to find new talent. I applied through the internal portal. I applied to the “technical” group, and my resume was viewed by hundreds of technical managers at corporate.

15mn9ii,DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the summary of how it's going after the seventh month,"Hi all,

on Dec 19th I launched [DataAnalyst.com](https://dataanalyst.com) \- this is the seventh update of hopefully many more to come - it'll be a shorter one this time.

Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on. 

While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/DataAnalysis might benefit from the site, especially those looking for a new data analyst job. I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey.

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.

Let's dive right in:

# 1. General Observations

## Stats

DataAnalyst.com has been online for just over 7 months and we've brought over 1,500 hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site - all of them including a salary range.

There's almost 1,600 people subscribed to the newsletter, and I can't thank you enough for your support and for joining us on the journey.

Following the site traffic and visitors peak in April/May, there's been a noticeable drop on those metrics.

In the early days, I would be posting between 10 - 15 jobs daily, looking to brute-force the marketplace conundrum and bring initial traffic in. At the same time I knew this was not sustainable in the long run, particularly on the monetization front - if companies see jobs added by me for free, why would they engage themselves?

So for now, I'm attributing this dump in traffci to the decrease in number of job postings added daily to the site and potentially also the wide-spread summer slump - people taking time off, organizations are slowing down hiring (which I've also noticed when hand picking available roles) and overall, activity drops.

The decrease also goes hand in hand with decrease of social media posts on Twitter/Linked, leading to less social media traffic. I have however added new profile pages on Facebook and Instagram, similarly automating job postings there, so will see how those channels perform.

While looking at the numbers go down isn't a pretty sight, I do believe that in combination with the organic traffic, it makes sense to have the (hopefully) short term dip, as it'll pave way for monetizing. Obviously this means there will be less jobs to apply to for now, but until I see steady inflow of company-posted jobs, I will not be looking to decrease the frequency / quality / quanity of listings any more.

I've also spent some time last month using tools such as SEMRush / Ahrefs / Moz to run some high level audits and understand how the site performs on the SEO front. This led to a lot of time spent on making significant on-page changes to improve keyword optimisation, rewriting meta descriptions and adding alt descriptions to all the images on the site. This is probably something that could (and should) have been done a lot earlier, but oh well.

## BusinessAnalyst.com

Some of you may have noticed that I've also recently launched [BusinessAnalyst.com](https://businessanalyst.com) \- where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over the last 6 months with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (afterall, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa). Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck.

Seeing July has been the first full month of having the site up, I will be also documenting the journey and posting a progress update on appropriate subreddits.

# 2. Expanding the data analyst salary guide

We are continuing on our mission to building out DataAnalyst.com - not just as a job board, but also as an educational hub - from interviews with experienced professional, best practices, to advice about getting into the industry. 

As mentioned in my previous updates, there's been guides recently released.

**How to become a data analyst guide** which covers topics such as:

* understanding the role and responsibilities of a data analyst
* becoming a data analyst, and what it obtains - from education, experience, to technical and soft skills
* the well known not-so-secret hack - building your own portfolio
* career development and salary guide (yes, our own!)

[**The data analyst salary guide**](https://www.dataanalyst.com/salary-guide) \- which provides the overview of salaries in various industries - and also shows a more detailed view on each industry page, with a deep dive into how much entry level, senior and lead data analysts can earn depending on their experience. 

Over the course of last month I've been restructuring some of the ways I collect and store data about available job roles, and I was able to expand the data analyst salary guide beyond just industry - now also detailing **data analyst salaries across different states in the US.** 

Now, as it usually is with this kind of exercise, lumping the data all together you come up with an insane range. On the other hand, if you split the data in 52 different ways, you'll get a whole different set of issues where N is not large enough to draw any conclusions - and for some states, there's simply no data at all.

As the site grows, and the number of jobs on the site increases, I do however believe that I'll be able to bring an addition source of information about salaries, complimenting those already available on other sites.

For the US, we've also released the July edition of Market Insights, you can see the full report in the blog section on the site as well.

# What's currently on my mind (random musings)

**Re: Newsletter** \- when starting, I wanted the newsletter to be sent on a weekly basis, containing the latest jobs. The more I thought about it, the more I became against the idea - afterall, people could visit the site and see, why spam their emails? At the same time, the point of the site is to help people find a role - once they would, they wouldn't really need weekly emails with latest jobs. 

I was recently able to implement better tracking of job views - how many people have viewed which job post. It may be that I could use this data to send a weekly ""hottest data analyst jobs on the plafrom for the last week"" - however, to do so, I believe I need to include segmentation into my email list i.e people looking for a job will receive these, whilst others would be able to opt out. This will require some restructuring of the current newsletter onboarding flow, but that's probably better to be done sooner, rather than later.

**Re: Improving site experience** \- I go through every single comment I receive on Reddit, and there's been a few in the last month or two, highlighting some inconsistencies in terms of UX/UI experience across mobile/table/desktop versions. I've spent some time over the last few weeks to address some of those bugs, discovered a whole bunch more, and have been fixing them one by one. I do want the site to be easy to use, with consistent styling and experience - so, if you come across bugs, please just let me know :)

# Things in the pipeline

* New data analyst jobs, added daily
* Actually launching the weekly newsletter with the pick of best jobs directly to your inbox (yes, I know...., but...above...)
* Monthly US data analyst market insights
* Improving the overall site experience (this one is a never ending activity)
* Continuing to bring you Data Analysts across their experience levels, to share tips, tricks and their thoughts

DataAnalyst.com has been online for just over 13 months, and we're bringing new, hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site daily. As it stands, we've published over 1,800 data analyst jobs in total, all of them including a salary range.

If I had to sum up January, it would probably be along the lines of:

*""New Year, New Me, New Job""*

Basically from 2nd January onwards we've seen incredible surge in visitor numbers over the course of the month. The only significant down days were when I accidentally deleted all the job postings from Google jobs schema, but managed to identify the issue fairly quickly - live and learn, right.

Unfortunately we're continuing to see layoffs, particularly in the tech industry, so combined with people's New Year resolution to move toward better pastures, I would say those were the main drivers for an uptick in visitors and applications made.

**Where did 10,000 people come from?**

* Organic - 65%
* Direct - 28%
* Social - 5% (automated job postings on Twitter, Linkedin, Reddit)
* Refferal and others - 2%

# Scaling up ain't easy

I've been chatting and more actively keeping up with some other people in the job board industry over the last month, and overall the stories are very similar.

Those who purely provide a job board service (i.e no recruitment/coaching services attached), the experience over the last year has been largely the same - companies have very much stopped/decreased their hiring efforts, and any revenue from job posts, have virtually disappeared.

The sites that are doing better are those who also provide those coaching services, CV/cover letter reviews, and are operating more as a recruitment agency with a job board, rather than the other way around.

The second type of sites that are able to bring in revenue, are those that scrape all the jobs, don't do any curation, and then put a paywall and have job seekers paying for access.

Why am I saying this?

With the site hitting over 10,000 unique visitors, as well as over 50,000 pageviews, I've started receiving headache-inducing emails - ""You're running out of bandwidth, upgrade your plan today to protect your site from downtime""

Alongside these emails, I've also noticed that one of the no-code tools that I am using, was recently sold (change of ownership) - how did I notice? Well, some of the features stopped working and support went AWOL.

And with the newsletter subscribers' count skyrocketing, I'm now also over the limit with my email marketing provider. I know, I know, it's a good problem to have (pls keep reading my emails and don't unsubscribe).

Put all three together, and the site is potentially about to face issues with job filtering, I'm pretty sure the view-count of individual jobs is also off, and as I'm trying to move to Amazon SES for emails, I've been fighting it off with their email support, over the last few days.

My main advantage still is that I'm ""splitting"" the costs of all these tools between DataAnalyst and BusinessAnalyst, so I still only really need one of the two to start getting traction.

As the technical issues started piling up over the last couple of weeks, it did also cross my mind to move toward a white label job board solution, that provides a comprehensive (and mainly) functional solution that won't need as much upkeep as my current monstrosity.

Upside:

* an option for people to create personal account and set up functional job board alerts into their inbox, submit their CVs for employers to browse and reach out directly
* overall probably a better option to monetize through various (already integrated) channels
* depending on the provider, some might also be able to do company outreach and sell directly for the site

Downside:

* all job boards look mostly the same
* no option to tweak and customise the solution to fit (what I personally think might be the best) user experience
* potentially higher expenditure per project, or on the other hand, profit sharing agreement with the provider
* depending on the provider, losing all the existing SEO benefits

No decision made, and I can continue as is, but I do personally feel that it won't be that long before I'll need to either monetize through ads, or through affiliates, in order to at least keep the costs at break-even.

But now, to the fun part.

# Day in a life of a Data Analyst, with Gene and Rennie

Another two interviews from our series has been published. In these interviews, we aim to share stories and experiences about the route to becoming a data analyst, keeping up with the skillset, recommendations to aspiring data analysts and much more.

Huge thank you to Gene and Rennie for taking the time, and I highly recommend everyone to read their stories, there's an absolute gold mine of experience and tips that you can learn from.

## Gene shares valuable insights into how data is being used in gaming companies

Honestly, this was an extremely entertaining and educating interview, that I can't really properly cover in a few paragraphs here, so let me provide a few bulletpoints that Gene covers

* from a Marketing Data Analyst role, to Head of External Operations (through a change of business ownership due to a gambling founder)
* how is the role of an individual contributor different to the one of a leader
* various ways how data insights drive behaviours and profits in a gaming organisation
* turning his passion for lacrosse, into an app

It was a rollercoaster of a few years for Gene, but he also shares some of his advice about starting out, and how does building your own projects help during the recruitment process:

*""If I were to give advice from this point in my career (between retirement at 32 and unretirement at 37), I would say to definitely do projects, use online certifications as a proof of concept and to make sure you like what you're doing. Do some projects for yourself, you'll put more care into them. Everyone can copy a project from a youtube tutorial, but if you can find something you're interested in, your results will usually be better than if it's just some project you need to do to get a job.*

*For example: hate dating? gather data about your data and break it down, expand on it. Like sports? do an analysis on your favorite team or player. Nobody really cares about logistics rates and times personally unless you own the company, do something you actually care about.*

*I can, however, give a bit of insight from the employer's perspective. The things we looked for was results. Can you do this? Can you do that? I don't really care what school you think you got some prestige from (if any), I don't care what you got on your gender studies exam. I'm worried about what you can actually do.""*

## How an internal survey helped Rennie land her Marketing Data Analyst role

As we've seen with multiple people already, the path toward her marketing data analyst role started internally within her organisation.

When the company launched a firm-wide initiative to understand upskilling potential, Rennie was selected for parnership to complete a data science program, during which she learned python and used tools to create data visualizations.

It's after the completion of the programme, that she felt comfortable and confident enough to apply for data analyst roles, eventually leading her to her first data analyst role.

In her current role she works on major campaigns and brand partnerships with professional sports programs and non-profit organizations to increase membership growth and brand loyalty. 

She shares her best advice for anyone interested in becoming a data analyst, and recommends a few things:

* *Learn SQL, most jobs will require some type of querying experience in your everyday role. There are a lot of free or low-cost resources available such as W3schools, Coursera, Datacamp, Udemy, YouTube, etc.* 
* *Learn a type of data visualization tool such as Excel, Power BI or Tableau. Excel and Power BI are free and easy tools to get creative and test your data visualization skills. I believe Tableau is discounted if you’re a student.* 
* *Learn a scripting language such as Python or R programming. Some roles may or may not require this skill, but it’s always a good thing to have more skills and experience with it.*

*The big thing is practice, practice, practice. 😊*

u6pjy8,don't apply for the brainnest data analysis remote internship on LinkedIn,"I applied for it and they rejected me but offered a ""Data analysis"" program in which YOU pay 140 euros for it and its for 1 month, the whole thing is a very smart scam. They post a remote internship offer in MULTIPLE countries for data analysis and other positions every week or two then reject you to offer a training program.

Now here's the funny thing, what they teach in the data analysis program is ""technically"" data analysis but it's not,  what they taught me once per week for a month was literally basic concept in statisitcs using SPSS (Statistical  analysis software) which i was taught in my university (business degree). And they don't even dive deep into it they just rush it so much and give you an easy task.

The instructor i was with told us that she has around 120 students in this month alone. Now do the math for all those poor people who fell for this scam and paid 140 euros, and that's just ONE MONTH. The operation is quite smart I'm not going to lie.

18yfhrg,DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the 2023 recap,"Hi all,

on Dec 19th, 2023 I launched [DataAnalyst.com](https://DataAnalyst.com) and this is the 1 year in update, covering the first year of building the site.

Let me start with wishing all of you, the absolute very best in the New Year 2024.

These monthly updates for the last year have been immensely helpful for me - from consolidating my thoughts, reflecting on results, and primarily from engaging with people on Reddit who took their time to ask questions, share some of their own experiences, thoughts and feedback. I've always tried to answer every single one of the comments (apologies if I missed some, not on purpose), and I do appreciate your continuous support.

While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/DataAnalysis might benefit from the site, especially those looking for a new data analyst job. I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey.

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.

**TLDR:**

It's going to be a long one, so I'm going to share one key learning that I'm taking from the last 12 months, and that I would like each and every one of you to at least think about.

**The power of consistently showing up - how much can one achieve, if they spend 30 mins, every day on an activity or a set of activities contributing to a goal they have in mind.**

Even though from the $ monetary side it's been an unprofitable year, the amount learnings I'm taking from operating the site can't compare to doing anything else in my career so far.

From developing skills to build the site, experimenting with growth tactics, writing and creating content, tinkering with UX/UI design, to actually making at least couple of sales and mainly, helping people on both sides of the job market. 

**30 mins, every day - it'll all add up**

Two graphs to kick us off, monthly stats to see the month on month progression, and full year stats to see it all come together.

# Where we started?

When DataAnalyst.com launched, I aimed to bring data analyst jobs from the US, UK and European markets.

After 3 months, I decided to no longer cover Europe & the UK region, putting the main focus on the United States.

There were couple of reasons for that.    

First, salary transparency is non-existent in most European markets. Second, out of those jobs that were posted and included salary, majority of them would be in the local language. All in all, I simply realised that I wouldn't be able to consistently add quality data analyst jobs for the individual market, which would eventually lead to poor job seeker experience - simply put, if there aren't quality enough listings being added over the course of the week, you'll extremely likely not to come back.

UK market for similar reasons - lack of salary transparency, but also the market is largely being operated by recruitment industry, resulting in lower number of direct company listings.

# Tech-Stack

Webflow - Website + CMS

Jotform - Form + Stripe payments integration

Airtable - database with job posts

Make - automating the flow

Placidapp - generative pre-populated images for social media

Jetboostio - smart filters + autoarchive + some other customisations (could be replaced by Finsweet for filters, which is free, but haven't had a chance to dedicate time to making it work)

Buffer - social media posts scheduling

EmailOctopus - newsletter

Nocodelytics - for visitor, pageviews and apply now button tracking

GSCTool - for faster Google indexing

Ahrefs - using free version, also offering monthly free credits to conduct a free site audit

# What we've done?

## Paid job posts:

To get this one out of the way.

From monetisation perspective, my original thinking was that paid job posts will be the primary revenue driver. While that may in the future be the case, at least in the first year it fell very short of expectations.

**Simple reason -  I did not really do any sales. Honestly, full stop.**

**I can't expect organisations to proactively find the site, with very little historical authority, and pay for a sponsored job post.**

Now, saying that, this is still a two-sided marketplace - applicants looking for roles, and companies looking for qualified candidates.

I believe I couldn't convincingly sell the site to organisations in the first year, and therefore decided to brute-force the job postings side first.

What this means that every single day I shared curated data analyst jobs (all including salary), interviews with experienced professionals, and salary insights across experience levels, industries and various states.

All in the hopes of being able to consistently attract the best data analyst talent on the market to the site.

**On a positive note, there were two organic paid job posts, and couple of experimental collaborations with companies  who found the site, and reached out.**

**I'm very happy to say that after struggling on other platforms, those who posted with DataAnalyst were able to make their hire within one or two weeks after sharing the job opening - that to me indicates the calibre of data analysts visiting the site daily is extremely high, exactly what I was building toward.**

Now I have multiple successful examples that I can build on going forward. (That doesn't change the fact that I still very much dislike selling, but at least that's a ""me"" problem)

With this out of the way, onto some of the activities that I spent time on, and what were the outcomes.

## SEO optimisation

I've spent some time over the summer using tools such as SEMRush / Ahrefs / Moz to run some high level audits and understand how the site performs on the SEO front.

This led to a lot of time spent on making significant on-page changes to improve keyword optimisation, rewriting meta descriptions and adding alt descriptions to all the images on the site.

The structure used to achieve this, was to programmatically target the following long tail searches:

* Data analyst jobs in p(State) - i.e Data analyst jobs in Illinois
* p(Industry) data analyst jobs - i.e Financial data analyst jobs
* p(Industry) data analyst salary - i.e Financial data analyst salary
* p(Experience) data analyst jobs - i.e Entry level data analyst jobs
* p(Experience) data analyst salary - i.e Entry level data analyst salary

What I've also done, is to optimise data analyst jobs for Google Jobs Schema - so all the jobs that are posted on the site, are immediately also listed on Google Jobs - therefore expanding the reach.

This is probably something that could (and should) have been done a lot earlier. Having said that, it's now something that I pay attention to with each update that I make on the site.

**Results:**

Personally, as mentioned before, I hate this - I am publishing somehow duplicate but not exactly duplicate pages, for the sole purpose to please the SEO overlords. I understand that going step too far would have a massive hit on the user experience, so I am trying to be very intentional to ensure the key information is consolidated and easy to find.

Overall, the content of the site is now ranking between 1st - 100th result on Google, for approximately 3,100 search keywords.

The biggest win is being able to rank between 10th - 20th place for ""data analyst"" search, as well as consistently showing up high enough to get some attention for ""data analyst jobs"" search, which drives most of the organic clicks.

Between optimising for Google Search Results, and Google jobs, the site has seen approximately 1,21 million impressions on Google - almost 1 million happened from September to December, right after my summer optimisation efforts.

## Backlinks

Similarly to SEO optimisation, having authoritative sites linking back to DA.

In the first experiment, I found a .xls spreadsheet online, with approximately 1,700 educational institutions in the US and their admissions' email address.

Mistake #1 - timing - I thought with Universities/Colleges starting in September, it would be a good time to get on their radar - just as they new students coming in and discovering what those institutions have to offer. Truth is, it's also the time when you have an enormous amount of freshers spamming the admissions office looking for directions to their dorms.

Mistake #2 - audience - on the topic of admissions office - they do not care of anyone reaching out to build partnerships, literally, that's probably the last thing on their mind.

Put the two together, and I ended up with 2 (thanks but no thanks) replies out of appx 800 emails sent. Silver lining - the email still had appx 50% open rate, so no harm done to email deliverability (spam score).

Learning from the experience, I decided to tailor my approach.

I've pulled together a spreadsheet with information about the University, Career centre or Course detail (i.e MSc in Data Analytics etc), direct link to the section where they are currently sharing resources, and emails for both someone from the department and the career centre.

**Results:**

With 30 institutions identified, results where much better this time (after appx 5 follow up emails, because, yeah...):

Uni 1 - gained 1 backlink to both DA and BA, Uni 2 - in the review process to be added on the site in their next refresh in January 24' Uni 3 - call scheduled to discuss partnership opportunities

I've also hit the popular directories / communities (such as ProductHunt or YourStory) to submit DataAnalyst on their site, with some backlinks gained as a result.

As a side-note, some people will claim that getting listed on University' career pages is extremely easy for niche job boards - after-all, the job board is providing free-for-students alternative to find opportunities to kickstart their career.

At least from my experience, this couldn't have been further from the truth, so don't count on your backlinks before they are linked.

## Newsletter

When starting, I wanted the newsletter to be sent on a weekly basis, containing the latest jobs. The more I thought about it, the more I became against the idea - after-all, people could visit the site and see, why spam their emails? At the same time, the point of the site is to help people find a role - once they would, they wouldn't really need weekly emails with latest jobs.

Secondly, since I really haven't put much thought into the structure of the newsletter, I had no subscriber segments identified - so even if I wanted to send out tailored job alerts, the current workflow simply doesn't allow it.

So, for now the newsletter will stay as is - sharing important guides updates, monthly market summaries, new interviews, and highlight promoted job opportunities.

**Results:**

Overall, newsletter open rates have stayed pretty consistent, at around 60%, with CTR rates hovering between 5-7%, indicating that people are reading, and are engaging.

I don't want the list to grow just for the sake of a bigger number, so I did go through pruning, unsubscribing people who haven't opened any of my emails in the last 6 months.

## Market Summary

Since the first month, I wanted to utilise the job data available to create monthly market insights - a deep dive into the data analyst job market, where we can have a look at the job openings and provide insights on the latest hiring trends - which industries are hiring the most, remote working and salary fluctuations.

With me being the one curating the jobs that end up on the site, it could be argued that these trends are not really representative of the overall market.

**Result:**

Saying that, I do still believe that even the said monthly snapshot, and the month-on-month comparison can provide some useful tidbits and observations - so, every month for the past year, a monthly job market summary was published.

I'm perfectly happy to accept that it does not provide extraordinary value, primarily because:

1. even if only few people find it useful, that's a win in my book
2. the content still shows up in search results, helping drive more people to the site
3. it provided me the platform, the structure and the data required to consolidate all the information to create the Data Analyst Salary Guide.

## Salary Guide

With approximately 1,650+ data analyst jobs listed on the site up to this date, analyze data to develop data analyst salary guide (updated quarterly) - the guide has now been updated to include data for the whole 2023.

**Results:**

Visitors can now find the data analyst salary breakdown, by these areas:

**Industry** \- breakdown by specific industry, overall minimum, maximum, median and average salary + salary breakdown by years of experience

**Years of experience** \- breakdown of all jobs on the site by years of experience - entry level (0 - 3 years), senior (3 - 5 years), lead (5+ years)

**State** \- this is where it gets tricky. Now, as it usually is with this kind of exercise, lumping the data all together you come up with an insane range. On the other hand, if you split the data in 52 different ways, you'll get a whole different set of issues where N is not large enough to draw any conclusions - and for some states, there's simply no data at all (not to single any state out, but I'm looking at you, Wyoming).

**Company view** \- as an experiment (and primarily targeting SEO benefits) I've also included average data analyst salaries at all the companies that are listed on the site.

Truth be told, until the amount of jobs per company gets into at least double digit numbers, it's probably a useless metric, but I am hoping to rank for some of the long tail ""what is a data analyst salary at X"" keyword searches.

As the site grows, and the number of jobs on the site increases, I do still believe that I'll be able to bring an addition source of information about salaries, complimenting those already available on other sites.

## Interviews

Alongside the job board, my other focus is to bring interviews with data professionals across the experience levels to share their journey, tips and advice.

Overall, we've published 8 interviews, that I believe bring different point of views, stories of growth and sharing unique paths that each individual took to navigate their careers.

There's an absolute ton to learn from these:

* how to land data role internally within an organisation
* the power of showcasing and reframing your experience outside the direct data analytics field
* and how moving into more leadership roles requires more than just being a data wiz

**A lot of the people who took their time to share are also Redditors, so just wanted to give a shout out and say THANK YOU again.**

**CTA: If you'd like to share your experience, please DM me, would love to feature more people!**

Insights from these interviews are also incorporated in the how to become a data analyst guide, which was published in the second half of the year.

## How to become a data analyst

Over the long term, I would like DataAnalyst.com to grow - not just as a job board, but also as an educational hub - from interviews with experienced professional, best practices, to advice about getting into the industry.

I wanted to build even further on our knowledge base of interviews, insights and resources, and put it all together in the first version of a guide to becoming a data analyst.

Result:

First version released, with the guide covering topics such as:

* understanding the role and responsibilities of a data analyst
* becoming a data analyst, and what it obtains - from education, experience, to technical and soft skills
* the well known not-so-secret hack - building your own portfolio
* career development and salary guide (yes, our own!)
* incorporating insights and quotes from interviews with experienced professionals

The goal is for the guide to be a living document - constantly evolving and incorporating new findings, advice and insights.

# What's next

Now that the structure and processes are fairly optimised, and the site getting traction with attracting aspiring and experienced data analyst, the main ""thinking / action"" that I have on my plate is to figure out the path to successful monetisation.

Some of the avenues that have proven to work in the market, and for me to investigate:

**Company paid job posts**

* as previously mentioned, this is where I thought revenue would be coming from
* will require selling and outreach from my side
* could consider both one off payments but also subscription type of a service

**Reverse job board / candidate database**

* users create profiles, specify their availability (freelance, contract etc) companies pay access to that pool of candidates - this requires very little screening, and the main effort is just in developing the membership aspect
* in addition to this, it would be an interesting idea for member profiles to look like mini-portfolio sites - which is something that pretty much all data analysts should have and be able to share

**TopTal-like proposition**

* heavy screening and testing candidates to only have the top 3% of data analysts who are available for freelance/short term contract work
* requires a lot of effort, particularly for the screening / tests / attracting the best
* company pay for access and % of salary upon hire

My main concern with both Reverse job / Candidate pool is that once you start handling user information + sensitive info in CVs, I think it gets really, really tricky with privacy laws, data storage and security overall - particularly a danger of laws being different across regions.

**Ads**

* not a fan of having ads on the site, but maybe could be tailored sponsor ads to the audience (data tools, data courses)
* would open up opportunities for sponsored posts in the newsletter

**Coaching / interview / CV help**

* would not prefer this, not really scalable + there's tons of people more qualified than I am

**Subscription based for data analysts**

* I've noticed some niche job boards that have struggled attracting companies, have shifted to subscription model where applicants pay a monthly fee to access job opportunities ($10 / month)
* Personally not a fan of this, it's stressful enough to be looking for a job, let alone to also pay for access, however, job boards that went this route found that people were willing to pay and support, and eventually they were able to make profit and reinvest back into growing the site

# Things in the pipeline

* New data analyst jobs, added daily
* Figuring out what to do with the newsletter
* Monthly US data analyst market insights
* Improving the overall site experience (this one is a never ending activity)
* Continuing to bring you Data Analysts across their experience levels, to share tips, tricks and their thoughts

17kwgrv,Pricing Analyst,"I recently landed a job offer as a Pricing Analyst, and I'm slated to start on November 27th. While I'm elated at the opportunity, I'm also a bit apprehensive since this will be my first foray into the corporate world.

My background is primarily in marketing, which undoubtedly played a pivotal role in securing the offer. However, I'm curious to understand the day-to-day responsibilities and expectations of a pricing analyst in a corporate setting.

For those experienced in this domain, I have a few questions:

1. What does a typical day of a pricing analyst look like?
2. What are the primary duties and tasks I should expect?
3. Given my marketing background, are there particular skills or perspectives I should bring to the table?

Additionally, the HR team asked for my preference between Mac and Windows for my workstation. Personally, I've always used a MacBook, but while self-learning tools like SQL, PowerBI, and Excel, I've found Windows to be somewhat more user-friendly.

For those in similar roles, would you recommend a Mac or Windows for this kind of job? Any specific reasons for your preference?

I sincerely appreciate any insights, advice, or anecdotes you can share to help ease my transition into this role. Thanks in advance!",92,49,eyedd007,2023-10-31 21:52:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/17kwgrv/pricing_analyst/,0,dataanalysis
s5a44q,Tips on getting started in data analytics,"SQL is absolutely the most important skill you should start with. From there, I would recommend getting some real world experience using the modern data stack:

- Fivetran / Stitch for data ingestion
- Snowflake / BigQuery for data warehouse
- git for code management
- dbt for transforming data
- Looker / Mode for data visualization

These are the tools that leading data teams are using nowadays (the dbt Slack channel is a great resource/community as well)

As an example of the kind of project you can use to get started, you can work with small businesses to collect their Square transaction data and calculate customer retention rates over time (and even look at segmenting retention by who’s working the register, time of day, or the products purchased) and comparing to industry benchmarks",93,7,Eastern-Hand6960,2022-01-16 11:36:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/s5a44q/tips_on_getting_started_in_data_analytics/,0,dataanalysis

On the other hand, I can’t help but feel like it’s also a way for nosey people like me to have some fun. I’d be the person who’ll tell the company how and where they lost money and maybe I’ll spot some other company “secrets” along the way. Or maybe if I work in marketing, knowing what ~50 year old men tend to buy? That’s so juicy. Like a juicy gossip about someone/something without a name if it makes sense.

18c74cy,Anyone want a buddy for working on their Data Analytics portfolio?,"Hi there -

I've been needing a little extra motivation to get non-work projects done. Wanted to do a portfolio for years and never succeeded. I'm not looking for a project idea or someone to work with, I am hoping that someone else has similar struggles with task initiation (ADHD anyone?) and that we can decide on a time (weekly or whatever) to ""meet"" virtually and just work on our respective projects for an hour, possibly chatting a little bit or brainstorming if we get stuck.

Doesn't quite matter what you're working on or what level you're at, but I've been a Data Analyst for a couple of years, mostly working with Tableau, Power BI, and Excel. I'd probably like to do my project in Tableau to start. My intention is to post on Tableau Public so I can have something to point to and talk about for any future job prospects.

Discord would probably be a great place to meet, especially if multiple people are interested and have different schedules. I'm happy to set that up. Otherwise I'm open to other platforms.

175heqg,I have lost my mind...,"I just took on a contract data analysis - data viz gig for a few months. It's more data viz than anything right now...but the problem is...these people have no idea what they want.

There are some standard monthly reports with like 2 KPI's presented in several different ways (why?).

All they know is they can't continue to do this as manually as they have been and that they want more value out of the data.

I've asked them:

1.  what is the story they're trying to tell with their data. 
2.  I've asked them what do their customers want to see or find valuable. 
3.  I've asked them what's not working with what you currently have.

No real answers to those questions (yet).

Their data is not complex. It's literally one gigantic ass table of by the minute observations that can be categorized with 4 options in one column. There are a few date-diff numbers they want. (like, how long did that take to change from the beginning of this entry). It is *not* sales data. It's literally just data entry data. Each row is datetime stamped from when they started entering the data and when they completed it. - SO MANY rows are blank (e.g., out of 14,000 rows from last month, only 1700 have completed timestamps). The row will have a start time and no stop ""we consider those didn't finish."" 

I am having the biggest brain fart ever and I think I am too far down into the weeds and can't see the forest.

I realize this may be a very broad question, but:
 
 * Can someone pull me out of the weeds and help my brain see what type of story or data I can pull out of this type of data? 

An example of what they have that I can tell you is a pie chart split 20 different ways that tell you nothing more than ""this observation occurred more than the other one"" - which is like no information. No drill downs, nada...like..what was that observation? Why do we care if it is bigger than the others?

13i98gv,Healthcare Data Analyst Roadmap,"Last week, I did a post about how I became a data analyst in healthcare.

How I became a data analyst in healthcare: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/13bur30/how_i_became_a_healthcare_data_analyst/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

In this post, I'll try to create a roadmap for those that want to do the same. Keep in mind that I work in patient safety and quality at a hospital, so that's what I'll focus on here. But there's tons of places in healthcare you can work. Insurance, Biopharma, Research, Genomics, etc.

I invite my fellow redditors who are also healthcare data analysts to contribute to this guide.

1. First, it's going to be very tough to get into this field without a college degree of some sort. The degree doesn’t necessarily have to be clinical or healthcare-oriented. In fact, most of my co-workers have only a 4 year degree, and their majors are widely varied: physics, English, biology, psychology, etc. 

Personally, I majored in Biology, I eventually also got a Masters in Health Admin, but I don’t think I needed this, and it was verrrry expensive.. If I were to go back in time and do it over again, I would have just done a dual-major in Public Health and Comp Sci.

2. Work experience: most of my coworkers, myself included, started in an entry-level role in healthcare that involved working with data to some extent. Project Assistant, Program Coordinator, Research Coordinator, Data Entry/Data Abstractor (the latter is what I did before becoming a data analyst).

One tactic to work your way into data analytics at this stage is try getting a mentorship with a data analyst, and work in some projects involving SQL, and Data viz like Tableau/PowerBI. I’ve seen people at my hospital make their way into analytics after completing a mentorship program, and then applying internally to entry or junior roles when there is an opening.

3. Hard Skills: Learn SQL, Excel, Tableau/PowerBi. Tons of free resources online. When I learned SQL, I started off on SQLzoo.net, and once I got the hang of the fundamentals, I did SQL challenges on codewars.com. If I were to go back in time, I would have also tried personal projects with a free SQL resource like Postgres or MySQL.

With Data Viz, I like Tableau Public. It’s free, and it is quick to learn the basics, but can take years to get so good that you can make your work not only look stylish, but practical at the same time. So don’t be discouraged if your stuff looks like garbage at first. My certainly did, and my crappy portfolio still landed me a job back in 2016. 

One way you can learn the fundamentals is by just following several tutorials on Youtube. Almost like understanding how a board game works by learning the rules as you play.

4. Portfolio Development: Once you’ve gotten the hang of things, check out Vizzendata.com. The author, Lindsay Betzendahl, is a Tableau Ambassador and Zen Master in the Public Health space, and has curated a wide collection of Healthcare and Public Health data over the past couple of years. And this has resulted in a very impressive suite of dashboards on Tableau Public published under the hashtag #ProjectHealthViz. See if you can make some on your own, without following a tutorial. Then compare your work to what others have done to see if you thought similarly to your peers, and if your line of thinking is on the right track.

Develop at least 3 entries in your portfolio so that you can display them during an interview. 

It would be awesome if you could incorporate something about Health Equity, and social disparities in the portfolio, because this is a very important subject that hospitals are starting to embrace.

5. Building Domain Knowledge in Healthcare: the buzzwords I often see for data analyst positions in healthcare are “Quality”, “Process Improvement” and “Metrics”. Besides working in the healthcare space (See step #2), some other ways you can get knowledgeable about patient quality and process improvement in healthcare is to do these things:

• Visit the IHI Open School and complete their 20 hour online training (Free if you have a .edu email account, or if you live in a WHO-designated least developed country). This teaches you the basics of quality, patient safety, and process improvement

• Can’t get the free version? They also have some free online videos on their website. But if you want more, and can’t afford their pricetag for the complete series, there are cheaper courses that are also good on udemy/coursera.

• Understand what ICD-10-CM codes, CPT codes (I think these are confusingly also HCPCS Level I, but don’t quote me on that!), and ICD-10-PCS codes are. I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to learn what HCPCS Level II, LOINC, and SNOMED are as well. But I barely know them myself, and haven’t yet needed to know what they do.

• Understand what Donabedian’s Model is, as well as the 6 domains of care (AKA the SEPTEE model)

• Read anything by Atul Gawande (I like his books the Checklist Manifesto, and Complications)

• Read the executive summaries of “To Err is Human” and “Crossing the Quality Chasm”. These articles are eye-opening. Somewhere between 100k to 400k people die every year due to avoidable medical errors. It’s more dangerous being a patient in a hospital than a passenger or driver of a car.

• Metrics: Figure out what ALOS, HAIs, Readmissions, Patient Census and ADEs are. This is just a short list of well-known metrics that are nice to know. There’s plenty of others, but there are so many that it will be impossible to memorize them all. If you are curious about the many types that exist, check out the national quality forum (NQF). They endorse tons of metrics. 

6. Network Network Network. I didn’t get my first job by mass applying to positions. Nowadays, it’s easier for me to get noticed via applications because I have built up a good resume. But when I first started out, I had to do informational interviews. And this is still my most effective strategy to landing an interview.

Here’s the idea. Connect with as many people as you know personally on LinkedIn. The more people you know/get to know and later connect with on Linkedin, the greater the probability that one of those connections works with healthcare data (your 1st contacts), or knows someone that works with healthcare data (your 2nd contacts).

Go to linkedin.com, search for the hospital system you want to work for, see the people that work there, and look for the 1st contacts and 2nd contacts in that order. Reach out directly to your 1st contacts, or if you only see 2nd contacts, ask the 1st contact to introduce you to the 2nd contact. Either way, ask the person working there if you can get an informational interview to learn more about the work they do.

When this informational interview happens, this is your opportunity to learn more about the work that they do, what they like about the company and their job, etc.

The informational interview is also helping you make a good first impression on someone who may influence the hiring process, and you are gently hinting to that person that you want a job where they work as a data analyst. It sounds flimsy, but I firmly believe that this will get you much further than mass applying to jobs. This process got me my first interview (and subsequently, my first job). I still continue to do this, and not too long ago, it got me an interview at a very prestigious hospital (though I didn’t get the job, ugh!).

So I’d recommend trying out both of these strategies to cast as wide of a net as possible.

The job market is tough out there, so I hope this is helpful in some way. 

TLDR:

•	Step 1: Four year degree
•	Step 2: Work Experience in Healthcare (Program Coordinator, Project Assistant, Research assistant, data entry, etc.)
•	Step 3: SQL, Excel, Tableau
•	Step 4: Portfolio of 3 items. Try to make them healthcare-themed. Try to incorporate health equity in one of them.
•	Step 5: Build knowledge of basic coding concepts, patient safety and quality concepts, and metrics
•	Step 6: Network, a lot.

12hql2k,You might be doing this wrong,"TLDR: it’s a rant/suggestion post about people not  understanding the analysis part in DA. Folks focus more on coding/software and not on building impactful insights. 

People trying to “learn” DA miss out such a key factor, which is unfortunately not taught in these online courses too. It is about learning WHAT TO ANALYZE. 

This frustration filled rant comes from taking a series of interviews and working with junior analysts daily (I work as a SDA for a retail company). Most of the above mentioned people I come across are great when it comes to being SQL monkeys; and trust me I know that organizations need them and you always start out in this field as one. But you are hired to find insights, not just write code!! 

Basically, people are technically sound, but they have no intuition or process to find issues and build solutions. People focus on what new visualization software is out there, not know how to properly VISUALIZE DATA. They can write code for complex KPIs, but don’t have any intuition to find or build any, ML projects are the same. 

I hope you get where I am going with this. If you are in any phase of learning or working, PLEASE emphasize on what to analyze and the different ways to treat, predict and visualize it to solve a problem or find an insight.

18bgbg1,Is it possible to find jobs that mostly only focus on data visualization ?,"I’m currently in my first data analyst position and I’m finding it quite difficult. It’s difficult mostly bc my manager sucks honestly. I got zero on boarding and the team I’m on is on another continent so communication can be very disjointed and I work very siloed. When I tried confronting him about this he was overall an ass and just told me my performance sucks and maybe this job isn’t in my skill set or interest. Super frustrating bc his onboarding basically consisted of him telling me to go ask another junior to train me, amongst a bunch of other contradictory things. This combined with how complex the work is, has been really burning me out and I often work crazy hours on projects trying to meet a deadline (while not even being very productive or delivering quality work bc of how this department is managed tbh) — also unrelated but I’m currently 4 months pregnant so it’s just kinda shitty. I’m hoping to push through until maternity leave and then look for another job during then.

Basically I’m a junior analyst, expected to deliver senior analyst work, without proper onboarding of training. It’s especially difficult bc it’s a highly specialized area of data analytics (bibliometrics), and everything is kind of new to me (programming, writing these very particular types of reports, the data visualization in tableau). I know I would be capable of doing it all, but I’m having real trouble balancing everything bc of how new it is to me and also my general circumstances of how little onboarding I have with a team not in my own time zone. At this point I’ve given up on the the programming part, which sucks bc I had hoped to learn more in this position. I only really have capacity to focus on the visuals and writing, my managers style of management is just so stressful for me.

My strong suit though is data visualization, and I wish I could honestly just got this and focus on this. I mostly work in tableau for this job, but I’d also be interested in expanding my skills using programming languages to create visuals (python, R etc)— with how much I’m struggling with everything else though I honestly have zero chance to even get to that point of being able to do this.

Does anyone have any advice for me? Are there roles out there that might offer this for me in the future? What should I look out for? On another note I think I might prefer a role that’s much less client facing this one.",84,86,lem0ngirl15,2023-12-05 16:48:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/18bgbg1/is_it_possible_to_find_jobs_that_mostly_only/,0,dataanalysis

srlxs4,“Breaking into Data Analytics” or too good to be true?,"Hi everyone! I’m new to this subreddit, so my apologies if this has been asked before. 
I’ve been contemplating pursuing data analytics for a little while now. I currently have a Bachelor of Science in Public Health, so not a data analytics related degree. I’ve seen so many people online rave about the fact that you can “break into” data analytics by taking courses and certifications on SQL, python, and tableau. However, is this too good to be true?? Can one really become pretty proficient in these and *actually* break into data analytics without a related degree or entry level experience? I know learning these platforms would take a lot of time and dedication, which I’m willing to do. 
This sounds so promising but also like it could be too good to be true. Is there anyone that has actually done this and broken into data analytics with out a related degree? Or any job recruiters or hiring managers with an opinion on this?

17uu0fb,for aspiring data analysts unsure how to stand out in today's job market....,"i'm hosting a **free online workshop this friday, nov 17th, 11am est to share a framework used to make your resume stand out** to data hiring managers. 

as a director in data / hiring manager who's worked in analytics since 2017, the 2 key aspects i look for in early-career applicants at the resume stage: 

1. hands-on projects that represent the real day-to-day of an analyst
2. a clear narrative around your transition to data, especially if from another industry

without these two elements, it's really difficult for your resume to stand out among others who have professional data experience. i'll be a doing a demo based on a resume from a student from my mentorship program, who got his first data analytics position just weeks after the program ended and started a few weeks ago. will be eye-opening and hopefully take some of the confusion / overwhelm out of the job hunt process, especially **for those of you who want a more clear roadmap** on what's actually required to become a data analyst. :)

18bmrkg,Am i getting paid fair enough?,"Hello,

After obtaining my Master's in Business Analytics from a prestigious university, I spent around a year finally landing an offer. My Current company offered me temporary employment that pays around $30/hour in NYC.
Since they didn't have any analytical tools like Tableau, Data Warehouse, etc., they wanted me to build everything from scratch. They had around 20 million rows of data in EXCEL and wanted to start building a data warehouse.

During my contract, I was able to clean the data,transformed them into SQL structure, developed multiple ETL tools and data warehouse, automated the ETL Excel->SQL process, answered business/management questions by developing analytical queries .

After my initial contract ended, they wanted to extend the contract, but I requested an increased pay. However, they were only able to increase it by a few dollars per hour. Do you guys think I'm getting paid fair enough? I know in NYC it's not enough. Still, I wanted to make sure that I'm getting paid fair based on my skill set and what I've done for them.

12buzr2,DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the summary of how it's going after the 3rd month,"Hi all,

&nbsp;

on Dec 19th I launched [DataAnalyst.com](https://dataanalyst.com) - this is the third update of hopefully many more to come. 

&nbsp;


Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on.

&nbsp;

While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/DataAnalysis might benefit from the site, especially those looking for a new data analyst job. I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey.


If it's not something that belong here, have absolutely no issues to take the post down and / or keep the updates to a different subreddit.

&nbsp;

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries, and providing a platform for people to share their career experience.

&nbsp;

Let's dive right in:

# 1. General Observations

###Stats
DataAnalyst.com has now been live for just over three months, and we've published over 950 hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site - all of them including a salary range. 

&nbsp;

In March, we've seen steady traffic with just over 3,000 unique visitors, 15,000 page-views and we've been able to register approximately 2,900 data analyst applications being started from the site! While the numbers are a little bit lower than in a (shorter) February, I'm still very happy with the engagement, especially since very little marketing of the platform is done. Google impressions are also growing, so hopefully we'll see a steady increase of organic traffic in the coming months.


&nbsp;

###First Testimonial

As you may have already noticed, we still haven't had any paid posts published on the site. Over the last 3 months, there's been very little done to reach out to HR departments of companies and to educate them about DataAnalyst existence, and our proposition. The primary reason is that I'd still like to see the traffic numbers improve, so when I do speak to those accountable for hiring, I could build the case of us being able to bring them qualified leads, much easier. 

&nbsp;

Nevertheless, I have been reaching out and talking to my Xoogler network (many of them are either running their own startup, or advising on growth), and I'm super excited to share the news that over the last month we've been cooperating with a data startup (an alternative to Snowflake that's fast, simple to use, and open source), to bring them qualified candidates, and to help them build out their data team. 

&nbsp;

While those roles were not necessarily purely data analyst ones, the data analysis skills are transferable in the sense where one can also develop their career as data engineer or data solutions architect, particularly for those with more experience under their belt.  

&nbsp;

Being able to bring qualified candidates is extremely important for us, and this was a great first step in showcasing our authority and reach in the data analyst hiring space. 

&nbsp;

We will build on this experience, and continue developing trusted partnerships with organisations, to bring more expert interviews, and data analyst job opportunities on our site, for all of you to learn from and explore.

&nbsp;

###Ongoing challenges

It's not all roses, and I am worried about being able to effectively cover the UK market - starting with lack of salary transparency, but also the market is largely being operated by recruitment industry, resulting in lower number of direct company listings. I am committed to my approach to only have job listings with salary posted, so will need to monitor over the next month if the time spent on the UK is worthwhile, particularly as there's less than 5% of the visitors coming from the UK, and as a solo founder with limited time on my hands. 

&nbsp;

###The ""other side"" of building with no-code solutions as a non-technical person
&nbsp;

*""Things take time, things break, and little annoying bugs add up.""*


&nbsp;

It's something that I have been trying to figure out how to address - I don't know how to code, to the degree where I couldn't code myself out of a box. 

&nbsp;

Now, I know how to copy & paste code that can help me on the task, how to ""read"" the said code and tweak it to do what I need (on the 100th attempt), but when it comes to putting together few lines of code from scratch to fix an issue or deploy a new simple feature, I am absolutely clueless. 

&nbsp;

When it comes to no-code solutions, they are brilliant in a sense that they can provide few pre-built blocks so one can quickly stitch up a working prototype, or even a simple end-to-end solution. However, either the feature that you need is available in the core proposition, or one has to custom code it and integrate themselves. Another alternative is that there's an add-on with a monthly subscription fee, but that gets expensive really quickly.

&nbsp;

Let me just illustrate it with an example: I have received multiple follow ups from people mentioning how there's quite a few expired job posts on the site. If I would put myself in the shoes of the visitor, I'd honestly be annoyed too. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

- No-code solution within Webflow? Auto-archive job postings after 45 days. While simple, and would probably clean up 80% of expired posts, it would still miss out on some expired, and archive some that are still active. 

- Optimal solution? Offer a button / emoji for people to report expired jobs, display the reported count on the posting to inform others, and auto-archive on a certain threshold. Effective, but I've been successfully failing all my experiments with this. 

&nbsp;

So, where I'm heading with this - reminder to myself, and to all those who build - **80 / 20 rule exists, and it works for a reason.**

&nbsp;

Also, I want to thank again to those of you who reached out with ideas, and feedback for improvement - I really value and reflect on all your thoughts, you are being heard, and just note that with me learning to code as I'm building the site, it does take a while to get things working, and launch on the site.


&nbsp;


# 2. Data Analyst Job Market Insights (monthly)


As the amount of job opportunities on the site grows, we're utilising the data available to bringing you the third (March) edition of Market Insights - a deep dive into the data analyst job market, where we can have a look at the job openings and provide you all with insights on the latest hiring trends for the past month in the US and UK markets. 

&nbsp;

With the insights I'm trying to bring answers to questions such as: Which industries are hiring the most? Are we seeing any salary increases? And what about the remote working trend?

&nbsp;

I can totally see that at least at the start, this will not be extensive enough to highlight any trends, but I do believe that doing this on a monthly basis, it is something that will provide value over the long term to those looking for roles - the more data points we collect, the more insights we can uncover.

&nbsp;

***For the US, March edition, you can see the full report [here.](https://www.dataanalyst.com/blog/march-2023-market-insights-data-analyst-jobs-in-the-united-states)***

&nbsp;

# 3. ""Day in the Life"" - a series of interviews with data analysts sharing their experience, thoughts and advice. 



We have shared the first interview on the 9th March, and it was with Eddie. He's also a Redditor, so if you're reading this, holla and thanks again for sharing!

Eddie spoke about his career journey at a pharma/biotech company, where he started as Clinical Data Associate, grew into an analyst role, and now is in a Data Manager position. 

My key insight from the interview was his advice to someone trying to get into the industry: ""Don't overestimate your competition. Many people just assume everyone else is an expert. They're not! I've seen people in high level data roles that are only just starting to learn how to program.""

**Highly recommend reading the [full interview](https://www.dataanalyst.com/blog/ernie-my-data-analyst-career-journey).**

For our next interview, we'll be speaking with Elijah, who's a Data Analyst at Humana, and we'll be aiming to publish it on Thursday, April 13th. 

# 4. Company directory

We've added a new page on site, where you can browse or search our list of companies who are currently looking to expand their team and have data analyst jobs available.

You can search for a specific company (i.e Apple, Nike), or keywords (i.e healthcare, logistics), our intelligent search can find it all!

Warning, it also looks for broad results in company descriptions, so you may come across a match or two that won't make much sense, but hey, experiments.

# Things in the pipeline

- New data analyst jobs, added daily
- Actually launching the weekly newsletter with the pick of best jobs directly to your inbox (yes, I know....)
- Monthly market insights (for the US & the UK market)
- Improving the overall site experience (this one is a never ending activity)
- Currently testing a feature that would allow visitors to report an expired job posting



# 3 ways you could help
1. Looking for a new challenge? Check out the website - I'm adding new jobs daily

2. Looking to hire a data analyst to your team? Do you know anyone looking to hire? Shoot me a message on Reddit (or alex@dataanalyst.com) and I'll upgrade your first listing for free!

3. As I mentioned, we've just launched the ""Day of a Data Analyst"" series. For those of you who are open to do an email based interview about your data analyst career journey, please just send me a message and we'll organise something - would love to get you featured and share your experience with our readers!

If you have any questions, concerns, come across glitches - please just reach out, happy to chat.

&nbsp;

Thank you all again, and see you in a month. 

&nbsp;

P.S: I realize these are getting longer, **TLDR: Overall numbers good; First positive Testimonial; UK numbers down; Coding skills leaving a lot to be desired; Market Insights published; Great interview with Eddie; My writing still shocking, so is my Reddit formatting**

tjwdjp,A way to get Google Data Analytics Certificate for free - The American Dream Academy,"**\*\*EDIT:\*\*** Sadly they're ending the program soon. New learners can register until Oct 16, 2023. All learners will have access until Apr 30, 2024.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I just found out a way to access the entire data analytics certificate on Coursera for free. The American Dream Academy is allowing any 18+ US residents with valid IDs and high school diplomas to enroll.

You just need to select the Google Data Analytics Certificate as your certificate pathway.

You would need to complete the ""Beginning with Me"" intro course, one of the certificates (Google Data Analytics in this case), and 2 workplace skills courses within 6 months of when you sign up.

16y3x7a,Started working as a data analyst and I’m worried I’m just using limited tools,"Hello! This is my first post on Reddit, so im sorry if there’s something missing. 
I graduated this year with a masters in engineering (not related to data analytics) and made a few projects using Sql, Power BI, python etc for my portfolio! 

I was really lucky to land a job in this field without any prior experience due to me doing an internship at the same company! 
The thing is, my role involves making reports on Power BI for different departments like a finance and HR! We usually get the data from excel files in SharePoint or APIs for finance.
I really like the job as I’m getting better at Power BI(reporting and admin side as well) and my team is really supportive and appreciative of my work! 

It’s a small company (with amazing work culture) and  I’m doing everything on my own from start to end but the thing that bothers me is that I’m using only one technology.

I’m practicing Sql and Python on the side, but would it be a problem to land another job later on without having real experience? It just stresses me out a lot at times. 

Of course I’m really grateful to have a job without any experience given the current market, but I’m looking for some advice on how I keep learning without getting real experience in it!

I am quite experienced in writing SQL queries (and data analysis in general).  
If you need any help with specific queries (home assignment, testing, etc) – I can help you with that. 

If you need to learn basic SQL from scratch – I can help you with that too.   
The only thing I need in exchange is language practice with a native speaker, especially in behavioral mock interviews.

irok5l,"the jump from Excel to Python, SQL, and Tableau is so worth it.","Earlier in my career I took time to learn Excel. VBA functions, pivot tables, VLOOKUP, you name it. I felt like I had a good foundation for data analysis, but I wanted to sink my teeth into Python, SQL, and Tableau. 

I noticed so many job descriptions from big tech companies that wanted analysts who could code and automate things. I started to run through Python courses, SQL tutorials, and analysis projects. I ended up landing a data analyst role at a record label and fell even more in love with data analysis.

When I got to the record label I started building data (ETL) pipelines, creating visualizations in Tableau, and conducting in-depth analysis using the pandas library in Python. 

The jump to Python, SQL, and Tableau truly was worth it, but I also don't want to throw any shade at Excel. I used to want to move away from Excel as quickly as possible, but I realized it provided such a solid foundation for what I'm doing now. 

Kind of similar to the manual and automation dynamic. You have to understand the manual process before you can automate. I feel that you have to understand what Excel does before you can understand using Python, SQL, and Tableau together. 

I want to encourage anyone who's currently using Excel and wanting to make the jump into Python, SQL, and Tableau.

It's worth it.

Keep going, keep studying, and you'll move to a point where you're comfortable using Python, SQL, and Tableau over Excel.

Get as much use out of Excel as possible. Maximize your time with it because it will only help your understanding of other technical tools and software later on. 

&#x200B;

I understand this post might elicit a few questions. What do you think? What technical skill do you want most? Agree/Disagree with anything I said? 

Would love to know what you guys think. In the meantime, if you're struggling with learning a technical skill or solve a data analysis problem in any way, would love to be of help.

I am the sole data analyst for my particular department and I moved into this role as the previous analyst is moving into another department.

I think my main critique is that my data is often missing the “so what” factor, for executives to know what the data means for our business. And an ability to get that information by glancing at the sheet not trying to figure out what I’ve done. And even actionable points.

While I think my data visualization and clarity has improved, I know I’m missing this factor. My question is, how did you strengthen this skill? How did you get to a place where you could do this effectively?

182uajh,Satured market?,"Hey guys, I'm a 28 yo Canadian living in Argentina since 2006. I'm currently working as a DA in a local company. I mostly write SQL and DAX queries, develope Power Apps and Automate to make my work and others easier, clean data and other math functions with Python (also one or two RestAPIs to connect to external data sources), and last but not least, I create reports and dashboards with Excel and PBI. I manage data from all around the company (logistics, finance, accounting, sales, etc). Obviously ChatGPT and BingChat helps me through my daily work. I 've a degree in business admin and been working in different companies as an analyst since I was 19.  
It recently came to my knowledge that I can do the same thing for a company abroad and they would pay me almost triple of what I'm earning today (600usd vs 1500usd monthly). I know that 1.5k for an American or a European isn't much, but here in Argentina with that money you're a millionaire (literally).   
So I started my job hunting on LinkedIn and other platforms (mostly LI) and I had ton of interviews and ""data challenges"", which, tbh, I struggled a little. 

It's been more than a month or two now and I've got nothing but rejections. I've searched for jobs before, I know how it is, it's not always gonna turn out the way you want. But I'm very suprised by the amount of interviews and challenges that I had (between 15-20), all ending in the same message: ""Unfortanetly, we've found someone else that fits better with the position"". I think I know what I'm doing as a DA, I work directly for the CFO, but in the IT area, so I have two bosses, both of them are really happy with my work and never been reprimanded for lack of performance.  
Reading a bit on reddit I saw the the market is a bit satured, lots of bozos applying. And on the other hand, I started to think that us DA are not that interesting as we were a year or two back.   
Am I late for job hunting? Is the job market for DA falling? Or is it just me being a sucker and blaming others for something I need to improve?",72,25,kana_diense,2023-11-24 15:14:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/182uajh/satured_market/,0,dataanalysis

13l44m0,Creating a post with my experience breaking into DA without a degree.,"Hey guys,

I wanted to share my story on how I became a data analyst. I did not go to school for this. I started from scratch about two years ago and trained myself completely online.

Between 2014 and 2019 I was working in sales for a small business that sold industrial equipment. The pay was not great (around 35k a year) and there was no opportunity to grow. Basically, I felt stuck. I was a college drop out, I had no prospects or marketable skills. However, I was very determined to improve my situation. I found that I really enjoyed excel and writing formulas to work with and keep track of my numbers. Eventually I became obsessed. I began building complexed calculators that became really useful tools in my role. This is when I began to see that I had potential in the field of data analytics. 

Fast forward to 2018. A close friend of mine and I were talking about some of my work and he offered to pass my resume along to his company. This was a huge corporate company dealing with pharmaceuticals. Looking at some of the positions I felt that they were way out of my league. For every requirement on the job postings, I probably met maybe two of them. However, he assured me that I should apply anyway, so I did. I sent application after application and eventually, after about 3 months I got an interview for a low level position in master data governance. Unfortunately, I totally bombed the interview. But still, I keep trying and applying. Finally, after 8-9 months of applications, interviews and rejections I secured a role as a junior business analyst. 

Now, in 2019, in my new role as a BA I was basically doing general office work. Managing customer accounts, creating reports, and data entry.  I knew I wanted to be a full fledged data analyst, but this role was far from where I wanted to be. I wanted to move up, so I tried what always worked for me; persistence. However, I ran into a wall. For another year I went through the same process of interviewing, and getting rejected. I decided to step back and focus on training in my free time.

Looking at the plethora of bootcamps, training courses, and tutorials, data analytics is one of the most widely covered topics on the internet. It was very easy to find material for study, but the problem was how to find the best path forward. I eventually landed on codecademy.com as they offered a full data science course for only $40 /month. I was able to get through this in about 6 months. Along with learning the basic skills like python, SQL, and data concepts, I also started learning VBA for excel. VBA was my favorite tool by far as I was able to automate a lot of my job with it. 

Moving on, I continued to apply for new roles, but even after I went through the training, I still was not having any success breaking into a data role. I had to try something different. Think outside of the box. I realized that not having a degree was setting me back in the eye's of potential new teams, but I really didn't have the time or money to go back to school. However, the automation I had set up for my day to day was getting noticed by my boss and other teammates. They where awestruck at the potential. I figured this might be the best way forward.

I decided to put all my energy into networking. I'm usually pretty introverted, but I put a lot of effort into showcasing my skills to other teams. I created a VBA class that I shared with all other teams and many people had joined up. Through this I was able to meet new managers and could show them my aptitude, eventually someone from the data analytics team took notice and tapped me on the shoulder. They finally offered me a position as a full fledge data analyst. 

To summarize, in order for someone to break into this role like I did, you need to be obsessed with DA, persistent, and lean heavily on networking.  It's hard work, but fun and rewarding.",71,21,kkessler1023,2023-05-18 16:47:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/13l44m0/creating_a_post_with_my_experience_breaking_into/,0,dataanalysis

Hi! I am ar\_t\_e\_m\_is, a senior data scientist and member of this sub :) I did create a new profile for this, but I do have a main I'd be willing to share if someone would like to DM.

I am hoping to offer an opportunity for aspiring and junior data scientists or analytics professionals to see what data science and data analytics is all about, by doing a live-stream of a data science project :). It is very common in industry, especially non-tech, for stakeholders to ask for a ""proof of concept"" quickly. I'm going to build one live :)

On **Thursday July 21** around **830pm EST**, I will be doing a livestream on Twitch with a dataset I have never analyzed, and working on a machine learning solution while live streaming :) I will analyze the dataset, prep it for a modeling problem, and try to build and optimize a model while also unlocking business-driven insights :) And, yes, this does include searching Stack Overflow and debugging along the way! During the stream, I will be talking about my career path, how I got to where I am at, and offering insight into the successes and failures of my career.

If you'd like to learn more about my background, I've included a redacted version of my resume.

Would LOVE to see you there, and will be very responsive with answering all questions about the process, my career, and the data science field in general.

If you have any questions, feel free to post below or DM!

Hope to see you there :)

u2glbh,Data Analysis CV Advice from Senior Data Analyst," Hi guys, I thought this might be helpful. I have been working in data analytics for 15 years. I get a lot of DMs on LinkedIn on what makes a data analyst CV. Also I see the question pop up a lot here.. I've hired about 30 analyst in my career and interviewed a ton. 

Here are the things I think really work

1. ROI - If you can demonstrate how you increased cost savings, saved time, or increased X, it catching HR and reviewers eye. This is due to the eye scanning for $ and % signs.
2. Bullet Points. I know this is basic but if you are in data, you need to be exact and making the complex simple is a great skill. Having a novel like resume is a great way to make someone miss out on your skills.
3. Listing the Software and skills in a separate section. Often times, an organization can't hire a candidate if they are not familiar with a specific tech stack of software. This is due to the time and cost for training is factored in to the decision making.
4. Projects--List the projects that or assignments that you received list this out with how and ROI associated with these. It helps show you know how to use data solve problem.

10zwafm,Faked interview led to a 80k job and suffered ever since - what should I do?,"
I’m a 29 F never had any full time job before. With a all-star career coach’s help (he is my partner), I landed an analyst role in a tech company. My teammates are awesome, they are convinced that I’m a multi-functional talent with strong personality and placed me in a project facing role to deal with complex situations.

The reality is I’m beyond incompetent, suck at writing, communication and analysis. This is my first proper job, I even struggled using Excel. My major in college is landscape design and I’m a half decent drawer and painter.

Over the past year, my partner shadowed me for dealing with all the difficult situations, helped me prepare for each presentation and rewrote most of the important emails. I’ve learned a lot but obviously not enough. Something like financial/ analytical mindset is so hard to train. 

Family wise, I have 3 young kids. Meal prep, housework, taking care of kids while doing my current job just seems impossible.

After landing the job, I got vertigo several times, at least once a week I need Tylenol for headache, had one blackout and gained 15 lbs. I had many panic attacks and constantly wake up around 3 am sweating about next day’s work.
I feel ashamed and completely useless, having trouble looking in the mirror.

I see 3 options:

1-Quit my current job and find another analyst job on my own
2-suck it up and learn
3-switch career to art/ design field

Please share your thoughts.

Edit:
Thank you everyone! I didn’t expect this many responses. Apart from sharing my art work, I’ve never posted anything on any social media before. You guys truly helped me organize my thoughts and see possibilities.

I think what stressed me the most is presenting and meetings. My current role only requires SQL, Excel and a little bit of Tableau. I’ve improved quite a bit using tools and will continue to learn, but still very uncomfortable presenting. 
I gave the wrong signal during interviews, mislead them to think I’m the presenter type. Our team has 9 analysts and I’m the one with most exposure to the rest departments in the company. My manager is very supportive, whenever I need to present, she’ll always try to be there in case I can’t handle some questions. I stuttered and felt nauseated many times.

Here’s what I’m going to do:
1- hire help for housework 
2- my year end review conversation is coming next week. I’m going to ask to switch for a role with less exposure, that’ll reduce pressure on me
3- go to the office more often, so my help is out of reach. When WFH, we set a new rule where he will not touch my keyboard 
4- exercise regularly

If there's not too much judgment needed, then getting some good background music going, putting my detective thinking-hat on and starting chipping away at it is something I really look forward to. 

What's even better is when there's really no way around starting the analysis until this gets done, then its more fun :).

y195rf,How can I greatly improve Analytical Thinking?," 

Hi all, I've recently started my first Data Analyst Job back in the beginning of Spring and I can use a large deal of improvement in the Analytical thinking department. I do very well in creating reports and complex problem solving on the technical end but I seem to fall short when it comes to presenting the reports as I feel I do not have a grasp of the thinking side of an analyst. I then get anxious and flustered and it all falls down hill.

I ask questions, but I always seem to be wrong in my approach. Overall, I get generalized tips from peers, but at this point I'm looking for a possible solution in regards to maybe a Course or 2 that can rework my thinking (if that's possible).

Thank you guys for listening. This has been really really stressful as we're a really small team and my recent review didn't fair so well.",68,16,exitwoundsz1,2022-10-11 13:31:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/y195rf/how_can_i_greatly_improve_analytical_thinking/,0,dataanalysis

127tqf7,"How do you use Excel, SQL, Python in your jobs?","This sounds silly or borderline stupid, even, but I really want to know how do Data Analysts actually use the tools on a daily basis?

I know that Excel, SQL, Python, and R are some of the most common tools data analysts use, but how do you actually use it at work?

Do you use them all together connectively? For example, you use Excel to create a database then you transfer it to MySQL. Then you analyze using Python.


Or do you use either one of them depending on what you are working on? For example:
-You either use Excel or SQL to create databases.
-You use either Excel, SQL, Python or R to analyze data.

I'm trying to find videos on YouTube that explains this but can't seem to find one. All of the ones I could find just explains how they work and how to use them.

1arhoqs,"Hiring for data analytics, junior role","We are a small business, about 80 employees. A touch less than half of that are in sales, most of the remainder are in production, then office. 

My brother and I taught ourselves enough to get by in Crystal Reports, and I self taught myself SQL. Looking at the various discussions on SQL competency in r/sql, I would consider myself an advanced SQL writer. 

So the question is... Who am I actually trying to hire, and what can I expect for various pay grades? (US north east) 

As it is right now, my brother and I are, more than normal, saying we don't have time to generate a report on X to either make a decision ourselves, or to hand to one of our employees/managers. Similarly, sometimes we don't have time to analyze existing reports to make recommendations to employees/managers. 

This is especially true when it comes to inventory analysis - how much do we have, how much do we have, how much is where? The discussion to investigate hiring a DA was born out of this discussion, but there are so many other places we need to either generate insights or follow up on previous insights. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, if we were to hire a junior - analyst, what could I expect? I'm thinking recent college grads or a couple years practical experience. Need to know SQL beyond `SELECT * FROM` but not query optimization or recursive CTE's. For the most part, I expect to feed them requests for data and have them compile it, sometimes make it pretty in (crystal reports, excel, apache superset, whatever). Anywhere that they get stuck I could certainly help them with get going. 

&#x200B;

At times, I would like to ask them to follow up on the data they export, things like ""the data says we need to order X product Y days ago - you should probably talk with \[employee\], this seems to be a recurring issue with them not ordering when the report says to order."" I would direct which reports I would want them following up on on whatever basis. Someday I would hope they would know enough to pull on threads and find insights that I'm not thinking about - but I don't expect that for a long time. In my area, the starting salary seems to range between $50-70k, and I think I'd be comfortable allocating a salary in the middle of that range. No decision on in office vs hybrid - haven't thought about it. So... are my use cases and expected salary in line or am I off base? Or am I not looking for the right discipline?

13ft7gy,Haven’t been able to pass hiring manager interviews. What am I doing wrong and how do I improve?,"I’m struggling to pass interviews, especially hiring manager screens where I have to talk about my experience. Questions like “tell me about a data project where you had to work through ambiguity” or “when did you use data to come up with a recommendation” type of questions. On paper I think I have the requisite requirements (MS degree, 3 YOE as a data analyst) but it seems like the projects I’ve done are not impressive enough to get me through the screening rounds. My Python and SQL skills are fine but my actual project experience lacks depth and don’t know how to improve this to get past interviews. 

I think I’m at a disadvantage because my projects were for external clients and many of them were short < 1 week projects that were existing analyses reproduced for different clients so there wasn’t too much complexity or ambiguity. I was also not communicating with these clients directly but through another client facing team. Many of these projects were on the ETL side of automating data reports with python and sql and I’ve found them hard to make interesting. I’ve done a bit of text mining too to mine insights but these were just using NLP models out of the box and interviewers don’t seem to be that interested when I talked about those projects. I also don’t know how much detail is necessary and struggle to find the balance between too little detail and confusing the interviewer.

They seemed like cool people and the company sounds like they're really growing and up to some cool projects with automation and AI that I'll be able to get into one day when I have a better understanding. So, lots of room for growth which is what I want. Then, ten or so minutes after the interview, the recruiter for the position called me and told me I got an offer!

Considering I started this journey only a month ago, I feel super lucky. I realize I'll be starting at the bottom but idc, I have room to grow and a starting salary that is better than my current salary in a job I've been in for years, and its remote! I feel like I hit the jackpot!

For anyone also starting a career transition, working with the recruiter was absolutely key for me in finding a job. Reach out to them and let them know what you want. Don't be afraid to ask for what you really want, because in the end they'll just find you a job you didn't actually want if you don't make it clear to them.

Some background and context, I am (35M) currently working a full time job as a basic office admin (mostly data entry using SAP and EXCEL) in a large scale company (over 40000 employees) in Dubai, UAE. I plan to apply for a data analyst position in my company by the end of the year, that department uses SQL, PYTHON and TABLEU/POWERBI. I am married and have a 2 year old kid, so I don't get much free time apart from the very late hour or two in the night when all the day's activities and responsibilities are over.

This is when I do my self learning. Currently focusing on SQL as i am fairly decent in Excel since I use it daily at work and will pickup whatever extra is needed as I go along.

I just picked up two books, SQL FOR DUMMIES and after I finish that I will start the SQL COOK BOOK by ANTHONY MOLINARO.


My plan is to go through these books while practicing on Kaggle.com so I learn and use/practice at the same time since in my current role we don't use any thing apart from Excel for the run of the mill trackers and reports, while entering data in SAP.

I have watched and gone through some videos on YouTube and LinkedIn, just the basics in SQL and I intend to stay away from YouTube as it is very easy to get distracted.

Will this be a good plan to start my learning journey? I am in no hurry and want to take my time so I can get my understadings of the foundations right and build up the knowledge gradually.

16ifzv1,How clueless are you allowed to be in a new job?,"

I started a new job 6 weeks ago as a data analyst for a large company. I’m still quite early in my career, and although in my last job I did a lot of data analytics, my role was much more broad. Now I’m in a purely analytical role and worried I’m performing worse than is expected of me

My manager has assigned me a few tasks now that take me longer than I think he expects for me to complete. Twice now I’ve had to ask for more time after he asks if I can have it ready by X date. He never complains about how long I’m taking, but I feel like if he asks for it by a report or a spreadsheet by a certain date, then he obviously thinks it shouldn’t take me any longer than that to do it 

The biggest things that slow me down are

1. The volume of data. My last company was tiny and so I didn’t have to do a ton of data manipulation. Now because there’s so much data, I’m having to spend more time extracting and cleaning, which takes me longer because I don’t have a lot of experience with it 

2. Non-visual presentation. Again, because my last company was so small, a lot of the reports I created were for my eyes only. I do have pretty good dashboarding skills, and I prefer dashboards because they’re easier for the end user to read. But when I’m asked to make a spreadsheet for someone else, I find myself stressing out how confusing it might look to someone else  

3. My own nerves. My manager doesn’t give me a ton of guidance when he asks me to do something, which makes me feel like he assumes I should know how to approach the task. He always assures me I can ask questions if I need to, but then I worry about asking something that’s “obvious,” which leads to me spending a lot of time trying to figure things out myself

The longterm goals that my manager has established for my role are huge milestones that would totally change the way my department is run. He’s not expecting me to accomplish these things immediately or anything, or even within the first year, but I find myself wondering how I’m ever going to create these huge complex reports/dashboards/systems he eventually wants me to create, if I’m struggling to even pull together a simple spreadsheet",61,40,Icy_Juggernaut1138,2023-09-14 11:32:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/16ifzv1/how_clueless_are_you_allowed_to_be_in_a_new_job/,0,dataanalysis

1b5xo50,My data analyst experience is useless.,"I am a career shifter and have been employed as a data analyst for about two years. I self-studied SQL, Excel, R, Python and Power BI before starting. But we only use Microsoft Excel and SQL. My tasks are just menial work like updating files in Excel with data from database and but no real impact on the business itself.

Our company is small and they've asked me to do dashboard mock-ups in Power BI,  but they're too scared to jump the gun and buy a license. So my dashboards are not being used in a company-scale.

I will be moving countries and I am currently rendering my notice period. In a last ditch effort, I created another dashboard but still no response. Also, I am applying to jobs with required Power BI experience and I am feeling really inadequate cause I don't know how Service works and how to truly manage a dashboard.

I am trying to make a portfolio and plan to do some certifications (PL-300 and Scrum Master) and will try to refresh some python knowledge. But I don't know if  this would suffice. Any help?

EDIT: Hey everyone, thanks for the responses. I think I now have an idea on how to reframe my experiences.

Also for those interested in my job, this position is neither in the US, nor the EU, nor India. Thanks for the interest though and good luck to us on our job searches :)",62,29,parasuko,2024-03-04 01:01:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/1b5xo50/my_data_analyst_experience_is_useless/,0,dataanalysis

zkpf2b,Bachelor's in Biology to Master's in Data Analytics. Accepted $90K Offer + Performance Bonus at an Major Bulge Bracket Investment Bank.,"**TLDR**: Did my BS in Biology, Withdraw from Optometry School, Enroll back to my college's Master in DA, Apply to Summer Internship very early, Apply to Full time Job early on, 7 Interview Invites, 1 Job Offer. Copy  of my resume at the bottom.

# Intro

This is not a brag post and I hope my experience helped someone deciding to transition into a new field and on the fence on doing a Masters or not.

I graduated with my BS in Biology a couple of years ago when the pandemic was in a full swing. I was accepted to an Optometry School and was planning to attend after graduation. Unfortunately, they announced that they were changing the modality to Online and I didn't think it was worth paying $65K a year, for 4 years, just to be saturated with debt to be an Optometrist. After some research, I did decided to enroll back into my Alma Mater in their Masters Program in Data Analytics.

&#x200B;

# Master Program

I am no way a scholar student. I had a 3.2 GPA in Biology and withdrew from Chemistry and Organic Chemistry classes before passing with a B-. I noticed my college had a evening Masters program in DA. Strangely, it stated that you could complete the Pre-Reqs the same time as you complete the Core Master Courses. I had almost no experience in Excel, or any programming at all so I was hesitant to enroll. After talking to the graduate counselor, I decided to enroll into the program which took me 3 semesters to finish.

The program was a little bit weird. It was set up for people who have absolute no experience to people that have experience in the field. Languages use were SQL, R, and Python. You could even take electives and learn to use SAS. There was some classes I took that taught advanced Data Mining methods (Neural Network, Association Rule, Clustering etc.). I was expose to using STATA and some Tableau for at least one of my courses. Honestly, it felt more like a Data Science program versus an Data Analytics program. While I took a Pre-Req and an Advanced course in SQL which I had a solid understanding in, but the Python and R Course was pretty lacking. They taught the course with the understanding that the class was a mixture of language proficiency. They didn't teach the very basics and the homework + exams were just changing variables and numbers around. I could look at the code and explain what the code was doing but if you ask me to write it from scratch, I could not do it.

Overall it was an okay Program. They started the program about 4 years ago and definitely were trying to fix the curriculum around to see what worked and not. 50% of the professors that taught this course had full time jobs on the side. It was nice hearing how the stuff we learned in class and which how they apply it to their day job.

&#x200B;

# Internship

I knew from the very start, if I want to find a full time job, I needed some experience. The most impactful way to get one is getting a Summer Internship. If I learn anything about grad school's rolling admission is to APPLY EARLY, longer you wait, the less spots available and harder to get one.  I only started applying 3-4 weeks after I started the Program. I had a great resume back from applying to Optometry School and all I added was a Project section which was some Homework assignment that I did. Surprisingly I did not have to send that much applications out before receiving invites for interviews. I had a solid list of shadowing and various leadership experience. During my talk with recruiters, they were more interested in my soft skills and experience doing other things versus hard technical skills.

    ~30 Applications Sent
    3 Interview Invites
    2 Offers
    1 Rejection

The Offer I accepted was a Fortune 200 manufacturing company paying **$26 an hour**. I applied on their website and the Intern posting was for a Undergraduate student but I manage to score the Offer as a Master's student. During my time, I learn a lot of things. Such as Agile Method, Different Technology Stacks, Communicating with different Orgs, etc. I did a real life project and presented my finding to the entire Division.

To make it short, I received a great Performance review and met my OKR's but.......

I did not received a Full Time offer at the end of the Internship. Even though I did great and the other interns thought I would get one. They wanted someone to hit the ground running with more of an Statistic Background and the couple of courses in Statistics was not cutting it. I also didn't know back then what was a XGBoost or Random Forest was (now I know now lol). I was thinking they wanted someone as a Data Scientist which I definitely did not qualify for.

&#x200B;

# The Job Hunt and Offer

I was disappointed that I didn't receive a return offer but at least I had something that I could showcase on my resume, *Experience*. I started to apply for full time positions right after the Internship and oh boy that was a challenge. Took me 3 months of applying every week to finally receive a fulltime offer. I had an okay ratio for interview invites to application sent. Invites from anywhere from Consulting, Insurances, Retail, Healthcare, and Finance field. I applied mostly on LinkedIn, Company Website, and even the College Job Fairs.

    ~250-300+ Applications 
    7 Interview Invites
    2 Ghosted
    2 Declined
    1 Position Cancelled
    1 Rejection
    1 Offer Extended

I knew the economic slowdown and hiring freezes were not looking into my favor. This was my last semester of the Masters and the constant rejection had me a little depressed. One day, I was looking to see at a one particular Bank on the progress of my application of a job role I applied. I noticed there was a Data Analyst job posting the same day on Workday. Read the job description and I hit some basic qualifications (SQL, Six Sigma, Communication, etc.). I did not know what the hell was MicroStrategy or have coding experience in SAS but I apply anyway because I didn't have anything to lose.

A week later I received a call from HR and went trough 4 rounds of interview. I had great discussions with VP and a Manager. I tried to make the interview very conversational since I would be working with them directly. I think what stood out for me was my interest in the Financial Space. I had a interested in Stocks, Financial Market, and Personal Finance. We even talked about Charlie Munger and his ideologies. They also liked that I had experience taking something technical and reducing it down to some understandable from a nontechnical viewpoint. Also my experience talking with stakeholders was a big plus. My technical interview was a little joke compared to a Data Science Case interview I did with a Three Letter Consulting company that I absolutely bombed. They asked me What is a Where Clause, Explain a Subquery, What is a Difference between Inner/Right/Left Join and a Example. I would use mostly SQL which I was good at and they actually have learning cohorts onsite to teach me Python and SAS which was a big plus. 2 hours later on my fourth round, I received a phone call with an offer.

    $90k + Performance Bonus. Amazing Health + Wealth Benefits. 4 weeks PTO and 10 Sick Days. 

I did not negotiate because I didn't have any leverage and it was wayyy more than I was making now. I also dreamed of working in the Financial Market and will be in a Division involving the Global Market.

&#x200B;

# Final Thought and Future Plans

I would still recommend doing a Masters even with it's flaws. I know most Master program, such as this, are cash cows to make money for the School. Majority of my classmates were International Students paying full price and the other half are currently working and their company are paying for it.

I knew that I did not have the discipline to complete a Google Certification or DataCamp. Tuition was pricey but they gave me a 7% discount of tuition for a returning student (LMAO). Looking at past classmates LinkedIn, majority of them worked as Data Analyst and eventually as Data Scientist or Data Engineers.

If I would recommend anything, definitely have an outstanding resume, practice interviews, and communicate efficiently. I am a Introvert so I absolute hate doing Presentations and get anxious talking to people but it gets better slowly.

I know people would not recommend doing a Master's especially if you have no experience but at the end, it worked out for me. My future plan's is hopefully get into the Data Engineering field. I enjoy working with the databases and had a great relationship talking to the DE at the internship or even maybe a Sales Engineer lol.

qmqke0,I Love Data Analysis,"I've been working for around 18 years now. I've worked in a variety of roles. I took 2 college classes in 2013 and didn't go back until 2018. I didn't know what being a data analyst was until around 2013. When I learned about it through a sales role I was in that worked with analysts, mostly because they determined our commissions. I was interested in what they did but we made more money so I didn't think much of it. 

Fast forward to around 2018 where some life changes gave me the opportunity to go back to school. I knew I wanted to do something with problem solving but still wasn't sure what field. I remembered that I was interested in what the analysts did at that previous company so I picked classes that I thought would help point me in that direction. 

Fast forward again to 5 months ago when I got my first role as a Data Analyst. I couldn't be happier! This is the first time in around 18 years of working that I love what I'm doing! It's such a great feeling. I'm very excited to see where this path will take me.

I’ve been working in data for 10+ years and co-founded [Graphext](https://graphext.com). I also led the creation of our own internal analytics.

This short course of **only 4 lessons** is designed to **connect the dots** between various components of the modern data stack, enabling you to:

* Capture the right type of data.
* Transform the data.
* Create dashboards for tracking KPIs.
* Do advanced analytics, to understand why the KPIs are moving or not.
* Create predictive models, to predict who will churn, will be a great lead score, or forecast sales.
* Do reverse ETL, to activate this data and take action in CRMs and other systems.

This is the course I would like to have taken when I started in the field. We want to bring more and better-oriented professionals into the data field.

zm24pz,Any ADHD data analysts out here?,"I've been studying data analysis recently as I want to get into this field and I already have previous experience with Excel and spreadsheets in general because I did an internship on a Pension Fund for about a year.   


When I was there I didn't really have to do much analysis and I was more in charge of creating spreadsheets for the managers to keep up with, so I usually took my time to make them look prettier and ""not boring to look at"".

The ""not boring to look at"" part is pretty important for me cause I have ADHD and this kind of work can be extremelly tedious and discouraging, but I do want to work with it as I think it's a very interesting field and could help me in many personal projects I have.   


When studying data analysis I notice people work with very basic-looking spreadsheets with numerous lines and columns and that bores me just by looking at it. I fear that having to deal with this kind of work will eventually drain me and make me lose interest in the field.

I looked at the paid version (15,000 dollars) of the full time program and the program schedule said they will teach courses to help you get certified in things like tableau. 

I spoke to one of their admissions counselors after I got into the free program and she was very blunt. She said they won’t really help you get certified or make a strong portfolio. It was obvious that since this was a free program, they really weren’t trying to impress me.

My manager always says stuff to me like “this is stuff I would’ve expected you to know by now” and gets pretty frustrated with me during training. It’s pretty discouraging for me and I’m losing confidence everyday and get anxious for work as well. Has anyone dealt with this before and have any tips in general.

Recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn for a position with a major bank, saying it’s an Alteryx specialist remote position, asking if I’m interested.

Sure, so I sent my resume which is spattered with Alteryx among other data terminology.

Just got a note back from him saying “Sorry to have wasted your time, this position needs someone with extensive Alteryx experience.”

17j4rj2,Transitioning from Being “The Data Guy” to a Team of Data Experts: How Can I Make the Most of This Opportunity?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve always been the go-to person for anything data-related in my previous roles, despite only having two years of experience in the field. Although it was rewarding in its own way, I always yearned for the chance to work with people who know more than I do, so I can learn and grow.

Well, the time has finally come. I’m transitioning to a new team where everyone is highly skilled in data. I’m excited, but also a bit nervous. I want to ensure that I make a positive contribution and soak up as much knowledge as possible.

So, for those who have been in a similar situation, what advice can you offer? How did you navigate the change from being an “expert” in a less specialized environment to being a team member among true experts?

Additional Info:

By the way, I’ve been told that the new team is open-minded about the tech stack. Most of the data I’ll be working with can be accessed through Snowflake or Databricks, platforms I have yet to gain experience in. My work will also involve a lot of ML models, and for visualization, I have the option to use either Tableau or Power BI. Most of my work will be done in SQL and Python.

If anyone has experience with these platforms or technologies, I’d love to hear your thoughts on how to quickly get up to speed.",57,17,Log_Rhythms,2023-10-29 15:01:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/17j4rj2/transitioning_from_being_the_data_guy_to_a_team/,0,dataanalysis

147537i,r/dataanalysis will go dark June 12th through the 14th,"##What is happening?
r/dataanalysis will be going dark from 00:01 EST June 12th until June 15th.  We will evaluate the status of things going forward after that time.   

   
##What this means    
The subreddit will not be accessible to the public or to members of the subreddit during the time that it is dark.    


##Why are we doing this?    
We are taking the subreddit dark to support the protests against Reddit’s change in API policies.  As of this writing, over 3,600 subreddits will be taking part in the protest.   The change in API policies comes into effect on June 30th and are varied.  There are a number of problems with the changes, but a key factor is that Reddit is requiring app developers for apps large enough to be widely used to pay an extremely high amount.  The popular iOS app Apollo is an example.  By their calculations, their payments to Reddit are set to go from $0 to [nearly $2 million per month]( https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/).  It is an amount they have found unsustainable, and they will end service by June 30th.   Similar calculations are likely for most app developers.  The number seems designed to eliminate most or all third-party app developers from providing apps for Reddit.  Huge numbers of users find these apps preferable to Reddit’s own app.  Many moderators, particularly of large subreddits, do not believe that they can maintain the expectations that users have of moderators today without these third-party apps.  We hope that by participating in the protest we will contribute to a slowing of [the enshittification cycle]( https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/) as applied to Reddit.    

    
We thank you for your patience and support where given, and hope you understand even if you disagree.

11ppipb,Data Analyst Job Interview gone wrong.,"An HR emailed me and said to me that they want to meet in person in the office, I confirmed. then she sent another email saying ""There will be numerical and python test"". I said it's okay I don't mind. 

I made like a little revision to my skills and my knowledge to be more ready. And when i arrived at the office i found out that the test is ""on paper"" and she gave me a test with title ""Analysis test"" and it was like 5 sheets of statistics questions and IQ questions and she said ""It's for 35 mins and you can use your phone as a calculator or searching if you want"".. The test was really not easy for me. And it has many numerical percentages equations/problems and very long advanced questions that needed more time and more flexibility. I had an applicant beside me after 5 mins left the paper and gone. I tried to answer and i think i answered many questions right and many wrong. 

After i finished and gave her the paper, she came to me again after 5 mins and said to me ""Unfortunately, you didn't pass this test so i cant give you the python test"" and i said to her it's okay, goodbye and nice to meet you. 

My Question here, 

\-Is this really normal for Data Analyst role interviews because i'm newly just starting to apply for jobs in the field? 

\-Should i try harder to be improve my skills in statistics? because this interview really disappointed me

It also does not prevent you from creating a post to _share your data and visualization projects_. Showing off a project in its final stages is permitted and encouraged.

16ap8sc,DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the summary of how it's going after the eight month (an eventful one!),"Hi all,

on Dec 19th I launched [DataAnalyst.com](https://dataanalyst.com) \- this is the eighth update, covering performance in August, with hopefully many more to come. It'll be a shorter update this time, due to absolutely manic month at the dayjob, but it's still been a very eventful month.

Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on.

While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/DataAnalysis might benefit from the site, especially those looking for a new data analyst job. I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey.

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.

Let's dive right in:

# 1. General Observations

DataAnalyst.com has been online for just over 8 months, and we're bringing new, hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site daily - all of them including a salary range.

There's now 1,800+ people subscribed to the newsletter, and I can't thank you enough for your support and for joining us on the journey.

## First job paid posting

To those who monitor the above table closely, you've probably noticed the number 1 in the paid posts cell for August.

Yes, it ***only*** took 7 months and 16 days to get a first paid job posting on the site. Hurray!

Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue purchased a fast-track job posting - it came organically, which is a great sign as well.

It also came in with a lesson learnt - after tweaking flows / forms, always double check that you didn't leave a bug behind. Unfortunately for me I did, and they couldn't complete the purchase, but fortunately they reached out and I solved the issue immediately. 

I've also upgraded the posting to a featured one, free of charge - I think this is particularly important. 

Linkedins, Indeeds of the world are too complex to ensure a human connection with each client, while as a solofounder, I want to make sure I go over and beyond each time someone puts trusts in me and the service. That's something I do believe founders should strive for, and something that will set them apart.

## Stats - Bounce, numbers, bounce

After seeing a massive dip in traffic, apply now clicks and Google impressions in July, looks like August numbers bounced back with vengeance, driven primarily by skyrocketing Google impressions / clicks.

I'd be grateful if someone could please explain to me Google Search Console Clicks vs Google Analytics Visitors - shouldn't each click that comes from Google Search, leading to the site, also mean that's a visitor coming in?

**Where did 4,421 people come from?**

* Direct - 51%
* Organic - 35%
* Social - 14% (automated job postings on Twitter, Linkedin, Reddit)

SEO optimisation - I've also spent some time over the summer using tools such as SEMRush / Ahrefs / Moz to run some high level audits and understand how the site performs on the SEO front. This led to a lot of time spent on making significant on-page changes to improve keyword optimisation, rewriting meta descriptions and adding alt descriptions to all the images on the site.  Whether this was something that caused the sudden Google love, I don't know, but this is probably something that could (and should) have been done a lot earlier. Having said that, it's now something that I pay attention to with each update that I make on the site.

## Things on top of my mind

**a) Expired Listings** 

There's feedback regarding some of the jobs on the site already expiring and leading to non-existing listings. Decided to address this in two ways:

First, I found out Ahrefs has a free ""Site Audit"" tier, which crawls the whole site and provides a report including all the issues i.e missing alt descriptions, including 404 links. 

Second, on each listing I've now included a link for any visitor to report an expiring listing. Hopefully this will improve the experience. I'm still leaving listings (without apply buttons) on the site, so people can see previous open roles and salary ranges (and ngl, I'm terrified of what the impact on SEO would be if I had deleted those..)

**b) Outreach** 

One of my main priorities for the coming 3 months is reaching out to organisations hiring data analysts and educating them about the niche job board, and how they can benefit by sharing their opportunities on the site. 

Additionally, I did notice quite a few .edu emails signed up to the Newsletter. This could be an interesting angle to explore, reaching out to universities, sharing that their students are using the site. This could lead to both driving in visitors, as well as potentially getting a backlink that would help increase the authority of the site.

**c) UX/UI** 

Lesson learnt - do not use experimental browsers when you try to do website design. 

I've been using Arc browser since the start of the year, with the toolbar being on the left hand side. 

I've recently used various browsers and monitors to see how the site looks on various sizes, and it's an absolute mess -> will need to dedicate some time to standardize sections and elements, so it's a more consistent experience.

## BusinessAnalyst.com

As I've mentioned before, I recently launched BusinessAnalyst.com - where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over the last 8 months with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infrastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (afterall, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa). Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any consistent revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck.

Shared [first update](https://www.reddit.com/r/businessanalyst/comments/15r5ecq/businessanalystcom_i_launched_a_niche_job_board/) couple of weeks ago - will need to figure out how to combine, if people are interested to see the side by side view. **TLDR: site still dead**

# 2. ""Day in the Life"" - a series of interviews with data analysts sharing their experience, thoughts and advice.

Another interview from our series has been published. In these interviews, we aim to share stories and experiences about the route to becoming a data analyst, keeping up with the skillset, recommendations to aspiring data analysts and much more.

**Alex, who is a BI manager at AWS**, has shared some fantastic insights, and I'd love to share his  advice on building a portfolio:

*""I've been mentoring a few folks on this recently, ranging from college grads to mid-career individuals in non-tech roles. My recommendation to each is to build an end to end portfolio of work. An example is using python to web scrape information from a website and persist to a normalized data structure in a database, using SQL to write queries and analyze that information, and then use Tableau or PowerBI to visualize results and share insights. Each step of this process is important for a rockstar Data Analyst/BI Engineer and will showcase the capability to do the work for hiring managers.""*

We also briefly cover the question of the Year: Is AI/ChatGPT a threat to data analysts? 

Highly recommend reading the [full interview](https://www.dataanalyst.com/blog/alex-my-data-analyst-career-journey).

# Things in the pipeline

* New data analyst jobs, added daily
* Actually launching the weekly newsletter with the pick of best jobs directly to your inbox (yes, I know....)
* Monthly US data analyst market summary
* Improving the overall site experience (this one is a never ending activity)
* Continuing to bring you Data Analysts across their experience levels, to share tips, tricks and their thoughts

2. Looking to hire a data analyst to your team? Do you know anyone looking to hire? Shoot me a message on Reddit (or [alex@dataanalyst.com](mailto:alex@dataanalyst.com)) and I'll upgrade your first listing for free!

qu1h90,I’m resigning tomorrow. Any advice?,"So I started this job 11 months ago. 1 month in, the boss that hired me was fired. 1 month later, my new boss resigned. At this point, I was drowning in work and didn’t even learn what most of my job was let alone both bosses. At this point, i’m doing 3 jobs in order to keep my own projects running. They tell me they will be getting somebody to help at least once a week. So for months I am fixing things, drowning in work and going to sleep with panic attacks. At one point I asked for less work or more pay and they laughed at me. I’m a relatively new analyst so I don’t know what’s acceptable. In September, one of my clients complains a Tableau dashboard is broken and I find out our database admin left and it was not being maintained. They never said a word or handed off the job. So now i’m doing about 5 jobs, including managing myself and my projects. I cannot fucking breathe and every day I finally finish I lay in bed sweating, panicking and crying.

Flash forward to Friday, I tell my boss i’m drowning in work and have no idea how to prioritize all these projects being dumped onto me. I’ve been saying i’m drowning in work for 9 months and this time he says, “I set up a 1 on 1 with my boss so we’re getting somebody soon”. At this point, I realize they never were getting anybody for the past 9 months and I was just being lied to so they could get me to keep the projects going myself. 

I’m resigning tomorrow but of course I have to lay in bed with panic attacks all Sunday. I’m miserable.",56,33,None,2021-11-14 22:40:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/qu1h90/im_resigning_tomorrow_any_advice/,0,dataanalysis
m7jye1,Google Certificates - My Opinion So Far 4/8 Courses Completed,"Hello all!

I'm currently exploring other career options. I got an advertisement on my google homepage for Google Certificates, checked it out, and signed up. I have very little experience with Data Analysis. I'm a 32 year-old American high school graduate with a basic understanding of Excel and Google Sheets, and had absolutely no prior knowledge of SQL, R, or really any aspects of what was involved in Data Analysis beyond what I read in job postings. ***I also want to say this is just my opinion so far, and my experience may not necessarily be the same for you.*** 

I signed up on March 14th. As of this post I have completed 4 courses (out of 8) in about ten hours. There are 8 courses in total, and each course is split into Weeks. The first week of the first course was so basic it frustrated my ADHD brain, ""So, what IS 'Data'?"" was a real question they answered... I know what data is. Everyone knows what data is. Right? But I sat through every second of every video. I did every journaling exercise, every quiz, etc., all the way through. And within an hour my first ""Week"" was finished. I moved onto the next ""Week"" of work. Then the next. I had finished the first month in about three hours, again, doing everything. At the end I figured, ""Ok, great, an intro for literally ANYONE!"" And I understood why the course started out as such. It was a bit frustrating and slow for me, but I moved on.

Then I started the second course: Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions. It was basically more of the same. It dealt with the subject of identifying and understanding how to figure out the right questions to solve given problems. But when I say it ""dealt with the subject"", that's pretty generous. Again, very generalized, very basic, to a shocking degree. I started skipping through videos and skimming the reading. I wanted to get to the REAL work. This pattern continued throughout the next two courses, albeit with some actual details on databases, SQL, and functions in Excel/Google Sheets in course 3 &4. Less than I'd hoped, but at a pace I feel anyone can follow.

In general the videos feel very... clinical. The speakers, can't figure out if they're actual actors or not, are hit or miss. But none so far are very compelling. The jokes are awful, but then that's not why we're here, and bad jokes are still funny for other reasons. I personally feel that if they update the course, they should focus on making these videos more informative and human. It's all a bit too stiff and corporate. I definitely enjoy that they have the entire transcript of the video available right underneath, though. You can click on a sentence and the video will play from that point, if you need. It makes for a fantastic option if for some reason you can watch but not listen for whatever reason. It's also great to skim the transcript to get the context of the video to see if it's worth your time if you want to move at an accelerated pace.

The ""Readings"" are probably the most informative portions to the coursework so far. Texts, charts, etc., about the subjects. Well written, clear, and concise, with good examples when necessary. Along with the glossaries I'd say this is the source of most of the true lesson.

There are these ""Journal"" portions I absolutely skip at this point. Personal reflections upon my goals aren't why I'm attempting to acquire this certificate. There's also discussion prompts which take you to the forums consisting of other participants in the coursework but I haven't participated yet. Once things get more difficult I'll dip my toe into that. Maybe.

The quizzes and tests are fine. They can be scenario based. There are links for you to download mock emails and datasheets to be able to answer the questions from the scenario, which I think is fantastic. Unfortunately, most of the time the answers are easily discerned without even looking at the mock data referenced in the question.  Most of the test questions are multiple choice, with the occasional ""Fill In The Blank"" type question. For example: ***""What is the correct LENGTH statement to use to find any text strings containing more than two characters? Type your answer below.""***

You can take quizzes repeatedly without penalty, and it keeps your highest score. Course tests however can only be taken 3 times without passing before you get an 8 hour timeout. I decided to explore how the testing works and there's a shocking lack of alternate questions, so often times you'll just get the same questions repeatedly if you didn't pass the first time. I'm unsure if that 8 hours starts ticking at the first attempt or the third... I'll check that out tomorrow maybe and edit this post. 

All in all, it's teaching a lot of extremely basic things, which I think is good, but I just don't feel challenged yet. I'm betting, and hoping, it'll ramp up in the coming courses. If you already have a basic understanding of what it means to be a Data Analyst, any knowledge of Excel/Google Sheets, and SQL, you'll breeze through even faster than I did. If you know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING except how to read with basic comprehension skills, type, click a mouse, and do some basic math, this course is within your reach. So I have to give credit there, this so far is for absolutely anyone.",57,13,MrTextAndDrive,2021-03-18 05:28:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/m7jye1/google_certificates_my_opinion_so_far_48_courses/,0,dataanalysis
i4hqvn,"I think that focusing on the technology part of the job is great, but there needs to be an understanding of the business as well and how we as the analysts can add value to just about every department within the company","I've been subbed to this subreddit since I made the change full time into being a Data Analyst and I've noticed that there is a lot of focus on the technology, tools, languages, etc. I don't see a lot of information or questions regarding understanding the business or knowing how to add value outside of the standard workflow requests.

I come from an Accounting background mainly in 2 different sectors:

1. Financial

2. Manufacturing

I've worked in industries from banking to plastics, healthcare, agricultural equipment, truck trailer, automotive, etc. All of these business require radically different solutions and have hugely different questions regarding how to provide value to these respective organizations. No 2 companies in the same sector are going to have the same challenges. Just because 2 companies may be in the Energy sector, if one is fossil fuel (coal) and one is nuclear, you are going to have a totally different regulatory and compliance environment, expenses, metrics, etc.

Just about every department loops me into their meetings because management likes having a ""data expert"" in the room who can answer technical questions about using and reporting on the data. They also see the value in having someone who is curious about what goes on behind the scenes after the data is captured. I ask questions in every meeting about the data entry process, what data is important to who, what problems they are trying to solve, and what improvements their team has found so far and then what improvements I might be able to suggest. 

There needs to be a critical understanding of the company by the Analyst in how the company makes money, what its different lines of business are, who its major competitors are (peer group review), what challenges the business is currently facing or might be facing (COVID), and what improvements management thinks they can make to the company as a whole. It's important to have a sense of curiosity and interest in the business as well. Some of the questions I've asked and had discussions around performing analysis and trying to develop predictive analytics around are:

1. If our raw material costs at standard for a particular vehicle are $X and we have engineering changes that will change the BoM by $Y x 300,000 vehicles a year because of market demand, but will be equally offset in revenue, how do we explain the change in revenue estimations not only for next year's business plan, but also for our auditors as part of their revenue verification process AND verify the current take rates for that particular part on the model we produce now.

2. How can we accurately track inventory fluctuations (by part number) for RM, WIP, and FG items by matching them to our monthly production? IE inventory receipts, shop floor transactions and invoices. We also need to reduce inventory on hand by at least $1MM so we also need to develop an ongoing system to identify any unknown obsolete materials or slow moving materials we have on hand and track those accordingly so we can reserve appropriately.

3. We believe that the weights of the resins on our BoM's are off by at least 5%, we think they are too high and by adjusting the resin usage we can lower our material cost at standard. We need to collect weights, usage, and scrap on a sample of every molded part we make for this particular BoM configuration over the next 1-2 weeks. How can we prove that the changes we are proposing to make to the BoM will actually reduce our material cost at standard in the next 2 quarters and will not be offset as losses in inventory adjustments? What statistical analysis can we do to prove our theory correct regarding BoM weights?

4. Compared to our competitors we are the lowest performing company in regards to revenue generated in this particular business line. We need to understand what revenue we are generating, where it's coming from, where we have inefficiencies and what we can do to increase revenue in the markets we serve for this particular product. How can we pull together a comprehensive overview by product, region, salesperson, month (last 6 quarters), and any trends associated with those criteria?

These are just a small snippet of some of the business challenges that I've had to work with multiple different departments in the company with to solve. Yes, knowing how to access the data and using SQL to query it and Excel to build pivot tables and pivot charts or power BI to build interactive dashboards with drill-throughs or Python to create SPA's for management to review the KPI's are all important and definitely part of the job, but I just don't see a lot of focus on answering the business questions that management is trying to solve and that I think needs to be a pivotal focus because if I'm interviewing with a company I want management to know that I can add value from day one.",58,13,None,2020-08-06 00:48:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/i4hqvn/i_think_that_focusing_on_the_technology_part_of/,0,dataanalysis

wvxna4,Want to learn and improve in analytics together?,"Hey everyone, 

Is anyone, who is a beginner to intermediate level and has zero to little prior experience in data analysis, interested in learning data analysis together? I've been learning stats and coding on my own, but I think having someone to talk to and get feedback will help me(and you) to grow more in the field. We don't have to be formal and don't have to chat constantly. I know everyone is busy with their lives, so we'll just leave a message to each other or set a time to chat. We can talk about what we're learning, and how we learned it, ask questions, do trivia or quizzes to check our skills, come up with project ideas, and even do projects together to put them in our resumes! (As I've mentioned I'm looking for people around the same level as me, so we can relate to each other's struggles without worrying about looking stupid lol) I think it'll be more personal than asking questions on Reddit. 

Looking forward to gain hands-on skills, improve our knowledge, and collaborate on projects!

UPDATE: First of all, thank you everyone for your interest! I have decided not to create a Discord channel because there are many with similar intentions, and I personally prefer 1-on-1 or small groups.

jce4qp,I was useful with almost no experience,"tldr: I Used a three month lockdown to study data analysis, and was able to apply it to my job with the military. 

I work for the military, so this will be a little vague, but maybe someone will read this and see that you don't have to know everything to start doing useful analysis. I also kind of want to brag a little.

I was locked down for three months due to COVID and decided to study data analysis. I signed up for some online training, and downloaded a book on Pandas, and a couple of books on Python.

When I went back to work, I had some free time, so I started doing some ETL stuff. The military unit I work for uses Excel for everything, and I was able to make something useful out of the 15,000+ lines. The information and graphs were included in a report to the commanding general, and will be included in monthly reports from now on. 

I kept at it, and was able to start looking at ways to identify trends in certain activity. I noticed a steep decline in one area, and let the lead intel analyst know. I told him that we would have to explain the trend. He looked into it, and was able to explain the decline. The next day the general asked about that exact thing. Because I had brought it to the analyst's attention, he was able to answer the general's question on the spot. 

The total amount of code is about 1000 lines, and I know that are some huge inefficiencies, but I'm working on it. 

Things I learned:

1- Even though I could do the exercises in the training, when it came time to work on real data, I was almost completely lost. The main thing I got from the training was an understanding of what's possible. I had to go back and look up how to do most things. There was just too much hand-holding in the training. 

2 - It's okay to steal code, but you have to understand what it does. The code to identify trends was taken from stackoverflow, but I had to modify it to do what I needed, and then be able to explain what it was doing before anyone else agreed to at least kind of trust it. 

3 - More on stealing code: I had to understand the code in order to modify it. The code as written did not exactly fit my needs.

4 - This shit is fun.

5 - Don't skip the data munging. The Excel spreadsheets have misspellings, inconsistent spellings, spaces at the end, and missing data. 

6 - It isn't just about the data. I had a little bit of programming experience, but in order to really make something useful, I needed to understand the Python as well. 

7 - This post got a lot longer than I had planned, but I'm celebrating my birthday in a country that may or may not allow alcohol, so I may or may not be drinking illegally.

8 - You're going to run into things you didn't learn from the training. For example, I have to reindex by day, but that doesn't include days where no data was entered. In order to get accurate daily averages, I had to get the min and max dates and create a new index by that first. I had to do some more date stuff before looking at trends.

The program I’ll be talking about is based on my years of being a data analyst (currently director in data), hiring analysts across 4 companies, conducting more technical interviews than I can count, being a bootcamp instructor and a mentor to many analysts on my team.

The workshop is linked in my Reddit bio - sign up and feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn (also linked in my bio). If you’re interested in chatting 1:1, shoot me a message on LinkedIn since my Reddit chats don’t always work.",52,4,theguiltedbutterfly,2023-04-28 15:47:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/131yfi5/for_those_of_you_who_want_to_know_the_actual/,0,dataanalysis
12av9m5,Megathread: How to Get Into Data Analysis Questions & Resume Feedback (April 2023),"_For full details and background, please see the [announcement on February 1, 2023](https://old.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/10r5eve/announcement_limiting_posts_related_to_career/)._

## ""How do I get into data analysis?"" Questions

Rather than have 100s of separate posts, each asking for individual help and advice, please post your questions. This thread is for questions asking for individualized career advice:

-   _“How do I get into data analysis?”_ as a job or career.
-   _“What courses should I take?”_ 
-   _“What certification, course, or training program will help me get a job?”_
-   _“How can I improve my resume?”_
-   _“Can someone review my portfolio / project / GitHub?”_
-   _“Can my degree in …….. get me a job in data analysis?”_
-   _“What questions will they ask in an interview?”_

Even if you are new here, you too can offer suggestions. So if you are posting for the first time, look at other participants’ questions and try to answer them. It often helps re-frame your own situation by thinking about problems where you are not a central figure in the situation.

This doesn’t exclude you from making a detailed post about _how **you** got a job doing data analysis_. It’s great to have examples of how people have achieved success in the field.

It also does not prevent you from creating a post to _share your data and visualization projects_. Showing off a project in its final stages is permitted and encouraged.

xjbq96,Day to day as an analyst?? What do you do??,"What does your day to day look like as a analyst? (business/product/data/digital/insights) I'm curious to know, I'm aware everyone's daily life as an analyst is different in different environments/roles/companies. We all know we can analyse data but else do we do day to day? I'll share mine. For context, I'm an Insights Officer at a B2B SaaS scale up. Our product is like Zoominfo, albeit on a much smaller scale!

I'll login, either remotely or travel to the office. Have a hybrid setup

\-I'll monitor the progress of our retaining revenue in a tracker - Some may have come in overnight/in the evening - See where we're at against our monthly forecast, will inform our CEO with any noticeable comments/progress

\-I'll monitor all dashboards - Pipedrive (our CRM) - Stripe - Baremetrics - Mixpanel- Are there any noticeable trends, is anything speaking to me. Who do I need to tell?

\-Analyse our sales funnel. How many demos came in yday? What is progressing through the funnel? How our sales pipelines looking? Are there any bottlenecks holding us back? Speak with Marketing Manager and sales manager to discuss anything of note

\-Monitor Mixpanel - Meet with Product manager - Is there anything of note or trends which indicate something unusual or interesting

\-Catch up with our Customer Success manager. She informs me of any successes/problems we're haivng with clients atm. Sometimes data isn't involved here, its just a general feel as to what is going on

&#x200B;

These are regular things i do several times a week but I feel as though there is so much more to analyst roles than spreadsheets/graphs/data. So much of our roles is also talking to people across the business, figuring out what the data means and what its telling us or isn't telling us. 

What are things you do within your role which would surprise non analysts?",54,20,Fantastic_Swan_785,2022-09-20 15:23:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/xjbq96/day_to_day_as_an_analyst_what_do_you_do/,0,dataanalysis

1abkqqj,I'm burnt out. Please assess my situation and suggest.,"Work was easy an year back. We used to have plenty of time to make dashboards. We used to have enough time to learn new things and apply. For example - start of 2023 we made 3 dashboards and ETL process in 3-4 months time. Team of 3 was working on this. 

And then the team lead left the company so we had to work directly with stakeholders/leadership which was also new.

Second half of 2023, our stakeholders changed and now the expectations are set at roof. I've alone had to make 4-5 dashboards, design ETL, analyse 3-4 big ad-hoc datasets, prepare multiple presentations, train other folks, work in crunch time. To be able to do all this I had to work 70-80 hrs per week, almost every week. 

On top of it in 2024 situation hasn't improved. Stakeholders are micromanaging. They would make a note of what we'll deliver each day and question if it wasn't delivered. I've had to work 90hrs this week (and this too when it was the week my baby turned 1 year). I feel feverish now and I'm guessing this is because of all the stress and sleeplessness. 

It is difficult to argue with the stakeholder because he's a star performer and had extensive analytics experience backing him. If we say that something can't be done in given time he would simply share sample codes to start with and expect us to shorten our timeline. 

I feel so stuck that all my weekdays go in working, weekends go in recovering and spending whatever little time I can get with my family and child. I have been wanting to update my resume and move for last one month but haven't been able to find any time at all. 

And did I tell you that calling in sick also doesn't help? Timelines remain the same, they just expect us to recover lost time by putting in more hours. Also pressure is put on other team members to do work of others if they're out.",52,16,maverick_css,2024-01-26 15:20:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/1abkqqj/im_burnt_out_please_assess_my_situation_and/,0,dataanalysis

u8yor2,At what point would you start applying to data analyst positions?,"I'm currently changing career fields and I'm coming from a customer service and sales background. Just wanted some opinions as far as how much I need to know from each data analysis 'knowledge prerequisites'.    
From my understanding they're SQL, Tableau/PowerBI, Python/R, and Excel/Sheets.    
I know you don't necessarily need to be a *master* with all of them, but just wanted some insight as to how much I would need to be comfortable with before applying and/or how much can be learned once I have the position. 

Can anyone give a rough estimate on what should be known from each of these categories before applying? I'll list where I'm at with each below if anyone has any insight on that as well. 

* I completed the Google Data Analysis course. From what I understand it doesn't really hold that much weight, but was a good starting point as someone coming from a completely different field. 
I also have a lot of the soft skills that seem to be wanted. Communication, working with a team, things like that. 

* Sheets - I took a 'course' for Google Sheets that focused on things that would be used for data analysis. I say 'course' because it was just a youtube learning series, so not able to write something like ""Completed XYZ Excel Data Analysis Course"". I feel pretty comfortable using it to manipulate/clean data. 

* SQL - I'm currently about midway through the Mosh SQL course. I am familiar with the basics of SQL including joins, and the basic clauses/operators. I've also gone though Stratascratch and done almost all of the 'easy' interview questions. Then will start working on the 'medium' ones. 

* Tableau - I use Tableau public and have taken sample datasets and created basic visualizations and dashboards. They're not fancy, just basic graphs, but I can easily explain what they are and what they mean as a whole. I am not familiar at all using PowerBI. 

* Python/R - No experience at all.

One avenue I've used to get experience was volunteering for a political campaign's data team.  Campaigns are ALWAYS looking for extra help, and will usually be happy to assign you some easy data cleaning or analysis tasks that you can use to hone your skills.

To get started, I reached out to the data/tech director for a mid-size PAC (after finding them on LinkedIn) and asked if they had any data volunteering opportunities.  If you can't find this person, reach out to anyone in the campaign and ask if they know who to talk to.  Within a few days they had me sign an NDA and I was working on getting insights out of their textbanking data - figuring out which messaging was working best, weeding out phone numbers that volunteers should have added to the opt-out list but didn't, etc.

15cvra8,Is it crazy to reach out to local businesses offering free analysis in order to build real world experience?,"I'm new to this whole thing and have been taking some online courses. Let me know if I sound stupid/crazy/unrealistic. To build experience, I understand that I can work with already made data sets found online, such as through Kaggle or WHO, US DATA, etc.

Is it unrealistic to also try to get real world experience on the side myself? For example, I would reach out to the owner of a local pizzeria and ask if he is already utilizing some type of data analysis to understand his business more and see where they can improve their business strategy. I would look at things like:

Best / Worst Selling Items

Days With High Sales Vs Low - Estimate of what to expect each day/week, inventory management, etc

What Location Most People Order From Based On Deliveries (Can We Use Targeted Advertising To Reach Customers On Other Side Of Town)?

Revenue Per Day Based On Sales/Expenses

This is just a basic list - i'm sure there are many more things that need to be considered in order to help them cut costs, increase revenue, etc... but the premise remains.

vr3q2r,Just finished a few SQL certifications including joins on DataCamp. Is this worth having on my LinkedIn and resume throughout the job search or are these useless? (Currently work a non-IT related job in healthcare rn but potentially looking to transition into an analyst role),"Hi guys,

I have been learning SQL on and off over the past few months and recently just completed a few courses including joins on DataCamp.

Once a course is completed, you are 'awarded' a certification of completion. Are these certs worth putting on your LinkedIn profile under 'Licenses & certifications' and resume when applying for jobs or is this essentially useless? 

When applying for jobs, some online applications ask for linkedin profile url. Again, would these datacamp certs be worth placing on your linkedin and resume since it 'proves' that I know SQL joins as well as just general visibility for recruiters for example or should I just leave this off since it does not count for actual real world experience, etc.?

What has been your general experience with this? Graduated w/ a BS in Biology from a few years back and currently work a non-IT related job in healthcare right now but am looking to potentially transition into an analyst role and I live in/near a very large city in the USA by the way if that matters.

13855hv,"Rant about feeling insecure being ""just a data analyst"", seeking support","Hi, I'm just ranting here and would appreciate any words of support

I'm a recent grad from a T20 college that specializes in STEM, think Caltech or MIT level. I majored in math and CS and gradually realized I absolutely hate coding. Technology is just not that interesting to me, and I dislike the culture and am not good at it. That's why I'm not a software engineer, and I don't intend on trying, so I don't need ""it's just impostor syndrome"" or ""just try harder, it takes time."" I simply know it's not a good fit for me. Honestly, I just love the humanities and wish I majored in linguistics and psychology. But anyways...

After graduation, I did a bit of nonprofit work and recruiting and marketing work. I was terminated from the latter job though, and as you may know, talent acquisition jobs are getting slaughtered right now.

So I got a data analyst job. I'm OK with it tbh. I still like math for the most part, and it doesn't involve excessive or the hard type of coding. It's not what I really feel passionate about, but it is what it is. I just still feel insecure though because I feel like data analysts aren't that respected or impressive to people. I know this is kinda dumb to think, but just coming from a T20 school, everyone around me is making so much more than me and have fancier titles like engineer or data scientist or product/project manager or whatever. In high school, everyone thought I was like a genius or something, and now I see people who weren't ""ranked as high"" doing better jobs than me. I don't want them to think I had so much potential and then just squandered it. Data analysts don't seem to be that prestigious or paid that well. Honestly, it's about the same as what I made in my recruiting/marketing job even though data analysis seems much harder.

I guess my question is do data analysts actually garner quite a bit of respect from people? I could be just in the wrong circles, but I feel like people think data analysts are run of the mill and substantially less impressive than an engineer or data scientist or PM like I said.

If anyone has any words of consolation, I would really appreciate it. Thanks.",49,82,throwaway-rhombus,2023-05-05 00:27:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/13855hv/rant_about_feeling_insecure_being_just_a_data/,0,dataanalysis
12sofdh,Automating repetitive task using SQL and Excel,"Hi all

I recently landed a job working as an analyst! Part of my job requires me to do a very repetitive, and boring task that I have a feeling can be done more efficiently, but I can’t quite figure out what to do here.

Basically I have to go through client requests that are asking to add a certain person / location to our database which holds all of our existing clients. 

My current process is to download the client requests in an excel file that shows the name, address, city, phone number etc. I then cross reference these request with our existing database using SSMS, if the request is something we already have in our system, I provide the ID that the client falls under. Otherwise I will verify that the new location / person being fits all of the criteria needed, and then add it into our database.

Like I mentioned, I have a feeling this can be automated but don’t know where to start, I’m open to any and all suggestions. Also if I didn’t provide enough info, or failed to make sense of the situation let me know so I can clarify.",49,17,DiligentAd2785,2023-04-20 06:17:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/12sofdh/automating_repetitive_task_using_sql_and_excel/,0,dataanalysis

The certifications I currently have are:  
Tableau Desktop Specialist   
Google Data Analytics Professional   
Microsoft Office Associate  
Microsoft Office Expert  
DP-900 Microsoft Certified Azure Data Fundamentals  


I've been using datacamp to learn all the tools, I feel pretty comfortable with excel, tableau, and SQL and now just looking to take the Dp-300 and PL-300 to prove SQL and PowerBI respectively and by the time I'm done likely by next month I'll be comfortable with all tools involved.  


That being said I don't have any projects or work experience, should I pivot more to focus on projects and not invest so heavily in certs? I know they certainly won't land me a job but my thought is it's enough to catch a recruiter's eye to read more on my resume.  


So will just my certifications be enough to get me something entry level or should I look at creating projects alongside the certs and what would be some best practices in completing that (Is it okay for me to reuse a dataset for a handful of projects, should I write a brief document explaining my process in sourcing, cleaning, and processing data for visualization?)

1buxbv0,DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the summary of how it's going,"Hi all,

on Dec 19th I launched DataAnalyst.com. In total, this is the 14th update, this time covering the February and March of 2024.

Downsides of being a solo operator is when things get hectic in life, there will be a lot less time to spend projects. Missed the February update with day job going cray, but I'm back with a brief overview of February and March progress - it'll be a longer one, so pour yourself a cuppa and get comfy.

Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on.

While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/dataanalysis might benefit from the site, especially those looking for a new data analyst job. I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey.

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.

DataAnalyst.com has been online for just over 15 months, and we're bringing new, hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site daily. As it stands, we've published over 1,950 data analyst jobs in total, all of them including a salary range.

Let's dive right in:

# General Observations

February flew by, showing continuous growth across visitors, applications, as well as positive vibes from Google and SEO benefits.

**Since start of the year, I have been trying to chart out a path to offer data analysts to create their data analyst portfolio page on the site, upload their CV and on the other side of the equation, develop a members portal for companies who could plug into the pool of candidates directly.**

Why? Well, here's my (very transparent) thought process:

a) Enable people to create their profile

* develop a portfolio page, which is a crucial part of data analysts' profile
* as people start sharing their portfolio page, it a) leads people back to the site, b) helps organic growth, c) helps improve the authority and reputation of DataAnalyst.com in the industry

b) Candidate pool

* as the number of data analysts on the site grow, enable companies direct access to members - so they can browse through people by skills, experience, and establish contact
* once company profiles are create, it also enables me to get direct contact with people who are hiring in orgs, so can proactively reach out to them once in a while, giving them discounts for featured job posts, collaborations etc

c) Featured applicants

* once you have companies registering, also give applicants an option to upgrade to a ""featured"" profile, basically showcasing their profile and portfolio immediatly when companies log into their dashboards

With that in mind, for the time being I decided to simplify the pricing for paid job posts, trimming from 3 options (Free, Fast Track, Featured), to only 1 option at one price - Featured job post.

All made sense in my head, and positivity was at an all time high when right on the 1st March, we've had a new Featured post selling, at the new price.

(Shameless plug: for those of you who might be hiring - historically, every single featured job post on our site would get over 100 qualified applicants, within a space of a single week. I've seen multiple companies posting a job, and signing an offer with a candidate coming from our site, in less than 10 days)

Anyways, where were we....

**Ah, yes, plan was set, February was great, March started with a bang, and surely it would continue that way.**

**Well, enter Google Core Update - March edition.**

Quick background for those who aren't really immensed in the SEO world.

Since always, Google would occasionaly release various updates to their Search algorithm - aiming to improve search experience, and helpfulness of results (this could be anything from identifying spam content, changing how authority of sites is calculated etc).

When OpenAI hit the ground running with GPT3.0, and people started utilising LLMs to create content, Google Search has been caught out, unable to really comprehend the situation.

From that moment, there's now been monthly updates release, where Google is trying to address the AI generated content, update their algo, and figure out how to actually identify helpful content they can serve.

It's been a brutal year for most people who have built their projects/businesses/blogs off Google organic search, seeing their traffic decimated.

**And, it's also finally hit DA as well. Even though I was always publicly questioning the accuracy of GSC results when it comes to impressions and clicks, comparing to February:**

**-** ***impressions went down -33%***

**-** ***clicks taking a -40% dip***

**With that, site also lost around -50% of keywords that the site was previously ranking for, now not showing up in results for those at all.**

At this point, you might want to revisit the stats update above - it looks like numbers gone up?

Yes, even with the massive Search engine ""I don't like you any more"" hit, we were still able to cross an all time high in terms of unique visitors, still contribute to over 14,000 job applications made, and still grow our newsletter subscriber base.

Which leads me back to something I mentioned when I kicked the project off, and after getting a lot of questions about the domain.

**I stand by my statement - now more than ever, category defining domain names give you THE unfair advantage on the market, no matter what is happening around you.**

Genuinely can't imagine staying competitive, let alone continuing to grow, with all the Google update rollercoasters, and losing 30-40%+ Google traffic in a blink of an eye.

**And for all those reading, who had their projects hit by Search updates - work out how you can grow alternate sources of traffic, so that when search engines change their algo (and their opinion of your site), you'll see less fluctuations, making you more resilient and resistant to whatevertheheck search engines are doing.**

**For DataAnalayst, the key to traffic diversification is the domain name (as a building block and platform to add value to those looking for a data analyst role) - the site is continuing to grow, steadily, organically.**

# Data Analyst Salary Guide - Q1 update

With approximately 1,950+ data analyst jobs listed on the site up to this date, we analyze data to develop data analyst salary guide.

The Salary Guide has now been updated and published to include data for Q1 2024.

You can find the data analyst salary breakdown, by these areas:

**Industry** \- breakdown by specific industry, overall minimum, maximum, median and average salary + salary breakdown by years of experience

**Years of experience** \- breakdown of all jobs on the site by years of experience - entry level (0 - 3 years), senior (3 - 5 years), lead (5+ years)

**State** \- this is where it gets tricky. Now, as it usually is with this kind of exercise, lumping the data all together you come up with an insane range. On the other hand, if you split the data in 52 different ways, you'll get a whole different set of issues where N is not large enough to draw any conclusions - and for some states, there's simply no data at all (not to single any state out, but I'm looking at you, Wyoming).

**Company view** \- on each company page, we include average data analyst salaries at all the companies that are listed on the site.

As the site grows, and the number of jobs on the site increases, I do still believe that I'll be able to bring an addition source of information about salaries, complimenting those already available on other sites.

# Day in a life of a Data Analyst, with Selvin and Isaac

Firstly, thank you to Selvin and Isaac, for taking the time, and sharing your experience!

Since I launched DataAnalyst.com just over a year ago, I've had many chats with people aspiring to become data analysts.

From the snapshots of cool looking dashboards, ability to work remotely from anywhere in the world, to extremely attractive salaries and benefit packages - what's not to love, right?

Frequently, having these conversations bring me back to my own experiences.

*""Alex, why do you want to do X (not Twitter)?""*

What the question really comes down to, is knowing what's behind my motivations, and understanding those incentives.

So, for those who are looking to enter the data analytics field, there are two excerpts from their interviews I would like to share, where both Selvin and Isaac are providing great thinking prompts for you to ruminate on.

## Selvin, Data Analyst at Wintrust Financial Corporation - on his transition from the education sector, growing through shadowing, and connecting passion with what you do.

*""I would say the first step is to confirm why you want to become a data analyst.*

*Two starting questions someone can ask themselves are:*

1. *“Beyond the income potential, what excites you about being a data analyst?”*
2. *""Can a data analyst career lead into future opportunities that align with your goals?”*

*You don’t have to know every single aspect about a data analyst role before deciding, but being able to confidently answer those two questions is a good start.""*

He also goes on to sharing how you building on your ""Why?"" together with what you're passionate about in your life, can help you in developing your data analyst portfolio.

*""I would recommend creating a portfolio that has a mix of “standard” and “passion” projects.*

*What I mean by standard is using datasets or answering business questions that you could typically see in the workplace such sales data from a restaurant or figuring out the most popular songs on a streaming service.*

*Passion projects could include data from something that you enjoy outside of your career. I believe this helps with learning data concepts as it’s tied to a topic you’re passionate about. For example, let’s say you’re an avid video game player, specifically role-playing games. You could find (or create) a dataset that shows all of the RPG games and the number of sales they’ve has for each console over a certain period of time. You can come up with a question or hypothesis, play around with the data, and analyze it to develop your own insights.*

*Putting these kinds of projects into one portfolio will show your data knowledge, ability to learn, and your personality and professional branding to help you stand out.""*

## Isaac, Senior Data Analyst at BlueLabs - on teaching himself SQL, seeing growth as an iterative process, and using data skills for social good

*""Allow your interests and convictions to lead you in deciding what to work on.*

*Let’s assume you are capable enough to work anywhere and on anything.*

*Then the next question is, “what do you want to work on?”*

*If you pick something that fills your metaphorical cup everyday, you will benefit from the natural momentum of your interests.*

*Pick something exclusively for clout or pay, and that will get old quickly. I’m fortunate enough to have been able to follow my interests and now even my convictions.""*

*For those who are currently actively looking for their first role, he wrote down his thoughts, to commemorate everything he'd done to land that first data analyst job.*

Here are the 6 tips he boiled the process down to:

* Develop a firm grasp on the basic tools (ex. MS Excel & Power Query, SQL, DataViz (Power BI or Tableau), and Python)
* Create a public facing portfolio (ex. Projects, writing, videos, social media, it just has to work for you to consistently share)
* Share your work publicly on LinkedIn and other social media
* Write a solid resume, submit applications and get to networking ASAP
* Develop a habit of lifelong self-study
* Iterate on this to make it your own

As I've mentioned before, I launched BusinessAnalyst.com - where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infrastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (after-all, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa).

Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any consistent revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck.

After the very slow start, the site is continuing its organic growth (albeit at a glacial pace).

I've naturally progressed with the content on the site, recently also adding a comprehensive business analyst salary guide.

While I'm spending a lot less time on the site than I would like to, I'm still reasonably happy with the growth I'm seeing.

I understand that the demand for data analyst roles, and data analyst as a career path has skyrocketed in recent years, making the job market extremely competitive and brutal.

Both Data Analyst and Business Analyst roles share a lot of similarities. So if you are looking for role that gives you exposure to data, going the Business Analyst route could also provide an opportunity to gain experience, and improve your data analytics skillset, albeit it would be a smaller part of your role. It's something that you can build on in the future, and use as a stepping stone in your pursuit toward a data analyst career.

# Things in the pipeline

* New data analyst jobs, added daily
* Figuring out what to do with the newsletter
* Monthly US data analyst market insights
* Improving the overall site experience (this one is a never ending activity)
* Continuing to bring you Data Analysts across their experience levels, to share tips, tricks and their thoughts

# 3 ways you could help

1. Looking for a new challenge? Check out the website - I'm adding new jobs daily
2. Looking to hire a data analyst to your team? Do you know anyone looking to hire? Shoot me a message on Reddit (or [alex@dataanalyst.com](mailto:alex@dataanalyst.com)) and I'll upgrade your first listing for free.

**Call to action: As you know, alongside the job board, the other focus is to bring interviews with data professionals across the experience levels to share their journey, tips and advice.**

Overall, we've published 12 interviews, that I believe bring different point of views, stories of growth and sharing unique paths that each individual took to navigate their careers.

There's an absolute ton to learn from these:

* how to land data role internally within an organisation
* the power of showcasing and reframing your experience outside the direct data analytics field, and
* how moving into more leadership roles requires more than just being a data wiz

**I'm currently looking for data analysts open to share their career journey.**

These interviews have are read by tens of thousands of people who visit the site.

It's a great way to share your experience, help others, but also showcase your profile and promote yourself as someone who's actively driving their data career forward.

**So if you're up for an email based interview, please just hit reply, write couple of words about yourself and we'll organise something.**

I would love to get you featured and share your story directly in the newsletter, with almost 4,000 of our readers!

If you have any questions, concerns, come across glitches - please just reach out, happy to chat.

Thank you all again, and see you soon.

## What this doesn't cover

This doesn’t exclude you from making a detailed post about _how **you** got a job doing data analysis_. It’s great to have examples of how people have achieved success in the field.

It also does not prevent you from creating a post to _share your data and visualization projects_. Showing off a project in its final stages is permitted and encouraged.

146texn,Difference between certification and certificate of completion,"&#x200B;

[Certification](https://preview.redd.it/4yiyaz1fxd5b1.png?width=1635&format=png&auto=webp&s=757f7b7e900128695a82c0379bcc6e12dfe549f1)

Lot of people asking about IBM and google data analytics courses and if they can get a job after completion, etc, etc...Those courses giving you certificate of completion which has absolutely no value, maybe you learn some basics in there, but that's it, I wouldn't place it in my CV.Certification in the other hand is a different thing, you can't cheat there (at least easily) and you can't get certified without actually knowing data analytics basics well and a tool you are getting certified in, for example Power BI or Tableau.Unlike coursera's more than less useless ""certificates"", certified Tableau data analyst or/and Microsoft certified Power BI data analyst giving you real knowledge and it's great to put in your CV, not as good as a degree in related field and experience working as a data analyst, but far better than some random projects and useless courseras courses.

Projects are good thing but as I said, everyone can build, maybe cheat little bit and steal some code, that's why recruiters looking for a certificates that is not easy to get without you knowing data analytics. (Degree is still best thing you can have, but certainly possible to get a job without degree if you are good enough)

At last, we all know that Excel very important, you don't really need any certification or anything like that, you just have to be really really good at it.

SQL and python are great skills to have, you will probably get SQL questions on a job interview so you have to be somewhat decent in that.

Python is the most important skill, for starting maybe being okay level is good enough, but in my opinion sooner you master python is better, because once you master python you can only focus on one tool, you can do basically everything in python, you gonna use some viz tool rarely and that's it, once you become comfortable working in python, I think you are good to go, there is not much data entry level jobs available so that's it, there is loads of seniors applying for data entry level jobs, that's why you need to have somewhat equal knowledge of tools at least to land a job.There is 230% more job seekers with degree than actual jobs available in this field, not to mention the job seekers without degree, so in order to have a real chance, real knowledge is only thing you can show recruiters.",45,30,Funny-Yam2319,2023-06-11 13:02:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/146texn/difference_between_certification_and_certificate/,0,dataanalysis
13hfhue,LinkedIn job applicants with Master's outnumbering Bachelor's? (Turned into a bit of a rant),"Just signed up for a free trial for LinkedIn Premium and every single data analyst job I applied for, (entry level and junior data analyst jobs) sample size of roughly 30, shows that the % of applicants wielding a master's is around 45-55% while bachelors is 30-35%. I'm in Canada and 2021 census data shows that 33% of adult pop has a BA while only 8% has Master's. I'm not sure if it means that in total, only 33% have a Bachelor's or it's actually 33+8 = 41% of the adult population have a BA but from the census and common sense, the # of people with a BA/BS far outnumbers those with an MA.

None of the job descriptions asked for an advanced degree. None of them even hint at one (ie. asking for deep statistical knowledge etc.) But every single job shows that there are more MA applicants and on avg, they outnumber BA/BS by a good 10-15 pct points. Of course, LinkedIn data is exceptionally noisy. But when the numbers are that far off....

Only reasons I can think of are that there are a lot of bot accounts, Twitter (used to), FB and other social media have tons of bots. Some jobs displayed that a good 10-15% of applicants had an MBA, which may have been added to the totals of jobs that didn't differentiate between an MA and MBA. I heard that literally anyone could get an MBA and only the ones from top B schools actually even matter. Some MBAs are only 1 yr programs, so I assume employers would probably put less weight into an MBA. Could it be that people with Master's are a bunch of nerds that lack soft skills to get a job so they thought getting an MA will allow them to one-up the competition and hence they are disproportionately unemployed and actively job hunting? Or worse, are people that desperate and lie about their education? Pretty sure employers could verify it very easily.

I can't compete in a credential dick measuring contest, so the question is: do hiring managers prefer those overeducated candidates (though they didn't ask for it in the job description) or do I need to join this arms race? I feel like I've read countless articles over the years ""is the Master's the new Undergrad?"" I've tailored my skillset (Tableau, Excel, SQL (used some window functions for what it's worth), Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, bit of SciPy)). I've a BA in Economics, have done a course in Stats, and two in Econometrics. I have less than one year of actual work experience in an analyst role. What else could they possibly ask of me? Some jobs want R, but Python is close enough, maybe I should just lie and put R on my resume, lest ATS throws it into the trash for not having that keyword? And do I need to learn CRM software, such as Salesforce, or could an employer tolerate that I learn it on the job? I can't help but feel that some may be holding out for a unicorn candidate that fits 100% of job description and then offer him a shit salary, and not have to train him.",46,35,EuivIsMyLife,2023-05-14 15:43:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/13hfhue/linkedin_job_applicants_with_masters_outnumbering/,0,dataanalysis

102ea1c,First job as a Data Analyst but there’s no team,"Hello everyone,

This is my first job as a data analyst and the company hired me for a trial of 3 months. I’ve done many projects concerning both data analysis and data science.

The catch in this is that the company has no team of data analysis/science and they are basically experimenting with me to start this area for them.

They are a manufacturer company (they produce lenses). They want me to help them with both their data (analysis and models/projections) and to use that data to get them new clients. 

I think this job is for more than one person since there are many things to do. But this is indeed a good opportunity for me and I’ll get good experience. 

I’m in need of guidance, I always thought my first job would be under the wing of a data specialist that would tell me what to do, but my employers expect me to do this be myself. 

I want to be realistic in what I can do for them, and I need to organize myself: Where do you think I should start with ? What data should I be asking of them ? 
What do you think my results should be in let’s say 1 month and so ? 

Thank you all for your help in advance. Any tips, courses, videos and books would be greatly appreciated.

1atm4mz,The biggest fear of getting into Data Analysis for me... Need some input.,"I'm thinking about leaving my current job sooner rather than later, but not without looking towards a new career. Some background. I currently work in phone sales as a Business Developer in the automotive industry. Been doing it for 8+ years now and I also went to online school and got an Associate's Degree in Computer Science. 

Lately I've taken some interest in Data Analysis... but I've also been paralyzed by choice because its not the only thing I've looked into (Digital marketing and tech Sales being the other). I've wanted to meet a few requirements with a new career.  


1. I aspire to work remote from home. (I'm okay with it not happening right away)
2. I want to be in a career where my job is not getting replaced by A.I.
3. I want it to be as close to recession proof as possible.
4. I want a DECENT work/life balance.

I know Data Analysis checks off a few of these, but I'm unsure about A.I. replacing that line of work. I wanted to get the pro opinions from people here? Do you think A.I. is a concern? I do understand that it is being used as a tool right now for Data Analysis, but would it really replace it entirely one day?

The main purpose of my book is to build **an intuitive understanding** of how algorithms work through basic examples. In order to understand the presented material, it is enough to know basic mathematics and linear algebra.

After reading this book, you will know the basics of supervised learning, understand complex mathematical models, understand the entire pipeline of a typical ML project, and also be able to share your knowledge with colleagues from related industries and with technical professionals.

And for those who find the theoretical part not enough - I supplemented the book with a repository on **GitHub**, which has Python implementation of every method and algorithm that I describe in each chapter ([https://github.com/5x12/themlsbook](https://github.com/5x12/themlsbook)).

You can read the book absolutely free at the link below: -> [https://themlsbook.com](https://themlsbook.com/)

otun9m,Getting a job in the data field with no degree or background,"Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

So a little background on me. I'm 29 years old, getting close to 30. I'm not happy at all with where my life is at right now, stuck at a retail job slinging out coffee to busy professionals. I've stumbled upon this role through my countless hours of researching jobs in tech, and it stuck out to me because I felt like it ticked a lot of boxes for what I'm naturally inclined and interested in. Plus, it did not feel as coding heavy as supposed to a web developer. I get that some of you may laugh at that last statement.

I get that coding will be a part of it, maybe even a large part of it, but it does not seem like it's the bread and butter of what a data analyst needs compared to an actual coder.

Anyways, let's get straight to the point. As the title states, I have no background in this field. I have a degree in art and painting and have taken no statistics or mathematical course ever during my time in college.

Currently, I'm working through the Google Data Analytics Certificate program, hoping this can open some doors for me once I get it. However,  I'm fully aware that a young newly minted college grad with a degree in CS or DA, is still going be a way more attractive option than a 30 year old with a certificate.

In addition, to taking the Google DA course, I'm learning as much as I can about Excel and SQL through YouTube videos, Khan Academy, Coursera, etc.

My current skill stack I would say is:

Excel: Beginner to Lower Intermediate

SQL: Beginner

Python: Beginner

Tablue: Only just started

&#x200B;

I'm desperate to get out of retail, but I would love to get at least a small taste of the data world. I know I will never be able to get an actual Data Analyst role now, but is there a role below DA that I can potentially get into? I've been looking at Data Entry roles, though I'm not sure if that is relevant? Plus, that job in specific is disappearing fast since entry is easy to automate.

If there is no entry into the field as of now, then I would love some recommendations as to what else I need to learn to supplement my certificate. Will I need more than the four skills I've outlined previously? Lastly, one thing similar to the art world that Data Analytics has in common, is having a portfolio. Can certain Excel projects be used to demonstrate my skills and be a part of my portfolio during interviews? Or, are we talking about well laid out dashboards, or perhaps SQL databases that may be more impressive?

I really like my job but the career opportunities are scarce (I would have to pass a competitive exam to be employed in a long term contract and spend 2 years in school). I am currently looking for positions offered in my country for DA but I do not really fit for some asked skills like use of powerBI/Tableau or skills like ETL.  I am wondering what should I do if I want to maximize my chances to be hired as a senior DA for a private company after my three year contract. I already look for PowerBI courses on udemy to do after work and pass the Microsoft certification. 

What do you advise me to do next if I want to remain competitive when my contract ends ?",42,18,PoroSnaxSan,2023-12-02 11:29:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/1891ti9/how_to_remain_competitive/,0,dataanalysis
187ojoz,Tips/guidance for a new BI analyst?,"Hello everyone!

I recently accepted the role of Business Intelligence Analyst and this is my third week in role. I’ve been with this company for 6 years now, but previously in sales roles. My company is rather large, so I am extremely humbled and grateful for the opportunity, but fear and uncertainty is certainly setting in. I was totally transparent in my interview and resume about knowing next to nothing about excel, tableau, and SQL (Teradata) which are the primary tools we use but I am extremely coachable and willing to learn. 

I’ve learned more in the last 3 weeks than I have in the last 3 years, but I still know next to nothing and even the most basic sql stuff is Greek to me. My boss keeps reassuring me that this is a learning role and that eventually it will “click” and I will be good, but I’m definitely feeling very out of place. 

Do any of you guys have any tips/recourses on how to get smart on SQL quick? Thanks!",42,22,Dantheman1285,2023-11-30 17:51:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/187ojoz/tipsguidance_for_a_new_bi_analyst/,0,dataanalysis

17blje1,Data Foundational Knowledge,"Hey everyone, 

Been working as an analyst since May 22 for a financial services company. I started at 44k 8 months prior to that at another department and after transferring over I’ve gone through several bumps bringing me to 105k. 

The promotions have come from me being decent at SQL, visualizing what I find, but mostly because I understand our business very well(pretty niche) so I know what im looking for. I’m feeling some imposter syndrome when our team chats with our engineer about databases and relationships since I never learned that foundational knowledge(Econ & Finance major). We store our data in a lake on AWS and im completely lost when they’re talking about Athena, S3 or whatever else they might mention. 

My every day is building queries and navigating through our messy data using CTEs, window functions etc. so I haven’t needed these foundations, but im interested in learning. Off the top of my head, looking for best practices, data governance, database structure and some understanding of engineering.

zmz015,Struggling as a Junior DA,"Hi guys, 

After couple of months of self learning, finally got my first position as a Junior Data Analyst. 

The thing is that the Data team organization is a bit weird. The DA aren’t really part of the Data team but rather part of the business units (I am a Data Analyst part of the Ops team for example, we got guys in the Marketing, Finance etc) 

The only folks who are part of the Data team are Data Engineers / Scientists since they work on transversal projects (that’s how they explain that) 

It’s difficult because I am the only DA (on top of that Junior) in my team and I feel like I am disturbing people (Data guys) from other teams when I need an advice. They don’t really know my data/tables and it’s always difficult to interact with them about my struggles. 

Moreover, as I am the only Junior DA in my team, I take dozens of requests every time and I just can’t handle everything. It’s a good learning curve, but sometimes I don’t even feel legitimate enough to refuse/challenge their ideas, since the requests come from the management. 

I feel overwhelmed even though I feel I can do it and have the competencies to do my work, but I just struggle and feel constant stress. There is nobody to challenge my data modeling practices / my code etc. I am just delivering something that works. 

What would be your advice?",45,16,nobodycaresssss,2022-12-15 22:55:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/zmz015/struggling_as_a_junior_da/,0,dataanalysis

tnefdx,"Aspiring Tech Professional Looking for Others Who Are Interested in Learning Data Analysis, Completing Projects, and Job Hunting Over the Next 6-18 Months","Hello, all!

My name is Keaton, and I'm 32, American, and a male. I have a bachelor's degree from an American university, but it is not in a tech-related field. In January of this year, I started to pivot myself toward a career change. I've been working in education for the past 10+ years, and I've really enjoyed it, but my time in this space is coming to an end. I've been living and working abroad for the past 2.5 years, but this summer (2022), I think I'm finally planning on coming home and changing careers. I'd like to transition into the tech space. Based on what I've read and learned, my biggest areas of interest are data analysis, full-stack web development, and cybersecurity. So far, I've mainly focused on the first two areas as I don't feel that I'm ready to tackle learning cybersecurity, and I definitely find myself favoring data analysis over full-stack web development. The learning path seems much clearer to me, and I find it more interesting overall. Also, I think a lot of my soft skills, including critical thinking, research, presentation, and project planning, will translate well into data analysis.

Here's my current learning plan. I'm trying to get a solid foundation in the skill/knowledge area before moving on to the next one:

1). SQL

2). Spreadsheets

3). Visualization Tools

4). General Theory/Statistics

5). Python

6). R

To this end, I'm using a few resources, including Coursera, Datacamp, W3, and FreeCodeCamp (among others). Of these sources, I'm really enjoying Datacamp. They have many courses, all of which are approximately 4-5 hours in length, that cover plenty of topics with exercises included. They also have projects, which I plan on diving into once my skills are up to par. Datacamp recently offered a year-long subscription at a discount of more than 50%, so I pulled the trigger.

Anyway, I'm reaching out to see if anyone is interested in partnering up with me, primarily for projects and for sharing resources and for job hunting, over the next 6-18 months. As of right now, I don't feel project-ready -- I think I'll need a few more months of self-study -- but I'm fully committed to completing them and adding them to my portfolio. Please note that I do work a full-time job, so at most, I can commit 2-3 hours per day to data analysis. Also, I live in Asia, so my time zone is 12-15 hours ahead of the U.S.

As with anything, I think it would be easier to work with others who are equally motivated. Whether you are an aspiring data analyst like me or someone with experience in the space, please let me know if you'd be interested. Perhaps we could create a Discord or something and work from there? I think a group of 3-5 people would be ideal, but I'm open-minded. Who knows -- maybe all of us will even become good life-long friends?

My personal interests are myriad -- gaming, exercise, education, sports, entertainment (e.g. comic books, films, t.v. shows), music, languages, personal finance, and many more -- so if we share any interests and we could create a project around one or more of them, that'd be great!

Anyway, thanks for reading. I hope to hear from some of you, either in comments below or in my message inbox!

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for all of the positive feedback and responses. I've read all of them and taken into account what was said. Based on what I've read, I've made TWO (2) decisions.

(1). Someone mentioned a Discord community called Dataxp ([https://www.dataxp.ai/](https://www.dataxp.ai/)). I joined this community and realized that it's better and more comprehensive than anything that I could hope to make. Therefore, I encourage all of you to join this group.

(2). That being said, if any of you are still interested in partnering in a smaller Discord group to share learning resources, discuss projects/portfolios, network, and collaborate, I still made a server. I'm NOT a Discord expert and don't have a lot of time to research how to create the best possible server, so the server won't have a lot of bells and whistles, but it should serve for now. If interest/activity grows, I'll put more work into maintaining it.

1bujkht,Got a Job! Now the real work begins...,"Hi Reddit Family,   


It's been a long time coming and with the help of the people in this subreddit, I finally made it happen. Recently landed a job as a Data Analyst at one of the FAANG companies (can't say which one, obviously). I was told that getting the job is usually the hardest part, but THAT'S THE FARTHEST THING FROM THE TRUTH.  


Getting the job is the easy part, considering I was lucky enough to have bypassed the technical interview because technical interview was honestly just conversational my resume and my conversational honestly got me the job! So I'm now being labeled/viewed as a Sr. Analyst but my technical skills don't match, and throughout this onboarding/ramp-up period I've been dealing with insane amounts of Imposter Syndrome as all my team members are seasoned vets in Tech.   


My main tech stack that I'll be using daily consists of Excel, SQL and PowerBI - can someone provide me with the best resources for each (free or paid, don't really mind paying at this point) that I can immerse myself in over the next few weeks in order to get up to speed as fast as possible, before they start having me own specific tasks and projects?  


P.S. - A Product Manager working with my team cross-functionally has been left in charge of training me but he has 15 years of experience and explains things to me like I'm a Yale graduate, regardless of how many times I try to get him to dumb things down for me.  


Could use some help from the wise minds in this subreddit. Working in Big Tech isn't all sunshine and rainbows haha

1af4xzc,DA Job Hunting Advice!,"Hello Everyone!

Just like many of you, I’ve been applying like crazy to many DA positions. I was recently denied an interview for a DA role but the recruiter actually sent me a personalized message back. I was pretty surprised, so I replied to him asking for some tips on my future applications. He was super insightful and this is what he told me. You may have heard/read someo of this already elsewhere. But I just wanna help the rest of you on your endeavors, enjoy!

“I will be happy to offer some help to you. Allow me to preface my commentary with my point of view, almost all my time is spent working with C, VP and Director of IT level hiring managers as opposed to HR. You will probably get advice from HR people and that advice will be valid as well. 

1) Perhaps the biggest mistake candidates have been making over the past year or so is that they will use the same resume for every role they apply to. Instead of using the same resume for every role one applies to, take a little bit extra time (especially for those roles you really really want) and make sure the responsibilities for the role you are applying to are embedded into your resume. I am not saying to copy and paste the same bullet points 20 times, instead use the same verbal tonality of your resume and just make sure that those responsibilities for that role are in your resume wherever honest and accurate. 

2) Most resumes, these days, go through what is called an ATS (Applicant Tracking System)...I absolutely cannot stand them and don't use one here...but, a lot of companies do. That ATS, essentially, puts your resume through a AI engine to determine fit. Due to this, make sure - at the top of your resume - bulletize your experience. You are probably seeing roles that ask for x years of experience in iOS, y years or experience in .net development, etc... At the top of your resume, bulletize that experience.... in other words 10 years of iOS Development Experience, 8 years of .net, etc.  Make sure - above everything else - those bullets are accurate and honest. Sometimes, people go overboard and just put a ton of keywords in their resume. Don't do this...instead (like in point #1) follow the same verbal tonality of your resume and how it is structured. Yes, you should add key words to your resume that directly reflect the job duties for the role you are applying to…just don’t be a crazy person about it.  So, for example, if the job description talks about you doing .net and React.JS development, be sure to you’re your resume – make sure to discuss your .net and React.JS development in detail…add in Node.JS, and other JavaScript libraries as well as wether it was C#, ASP.Net or VB.Net wherever honest and accurate. Just don’t have a resume that has three hundred bullet points that just state ‘.net development’, and then another that says ‘React.JS development’ with no context around it.  Reason being, your resume will eventually make it to the hiring manager's desk and they kind of like decent sentence structure, punctuation, and complete thoughts (thought I would add some humor). 

3) Hiring today is all about reduction of what I call 'resource risk'. What is resource risk? Resource risk is the risk any hiring manager makes when they hire someone. Resource risk comes in the form of someone not being able to do the job (that is where points 1&2 come up), it also comes in the form of weather someone is going to work well with the team that that hiring manager has spent - in some cases - years building. So, show that you are an easy going and great person that you are..show that you can get along with anyone by showing examples of that getting along with even the most challenging people. Don't simply say ""I learn quickly"", or ""I get along with anyone""...bring concrete examples. ""I learn quickly"" and ""I get along well with everyone"" are what I call 'twinkie words'...they look nice on the outside but have no food value on the inside...this is, unless you bring concrete examples to the table. So, be that same genuine, and decent person you are and you will be off to a great start. 

4) Perhaps the biggest thing you can do to reduce that resource risk mentioned in point number 3 is to be introduced to someone at the firm you are looking to work for by someone you know. So, feel free to use LinkedIN as an asset. Use it to help you find people that know people at the place you are looking to gain employment. Ask for introductions to people at the firm you are interested in pursuing opportunities. However, I caution people on using LinkedIN as a 'let me see what I can get' vehicle. Instead, use LinkedIN as a vehicle to help people. The more help you offer, the more help will come your way... I am willing to bet you have skills or ideas that would prove helpful to others...share those thoughts, it very well might help someone else. There is a saying in sales 'always be closing'...in LinkedIN it is 'always be helping'.”",39,33,toocozzzy23,2024-01-31 01:02:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/1af4xzc/da_job_hunting_advice/,0,dataanalysis

o1gtnm,I just finished a 6 month boot camp in Data Analytics/Visualization.

It was a lot of work with a few stressful projects, but I feel prepared to enter a new role in DA.

Update: I landed a job in late 2021 with a very well known company. While in bootcamp, I helped out a fellow student during office hours and he ended up referring me to the company I work for now. It pays to do good things haha. Anyways I am on track to get a promotion this year and have been working on building legacy modules in Python. The experience I gained in the bootcamp definitely helped prepare me for where I am now and I probably would not have gotten the job without it. I am much more knowledgeable now of the coding platforms that were introduced in the bootcamp, but that obviously comes through experience.

uirkg5,You’ve just received your first dataset to analyse. Now what?,"This is the content of my blog post at [https://oscarbaruffa.com/step0/](https://oscarbaruffa.com/step0/). I've seen a few people ask about how to start analysing data and I think this will help.

EDIT: I've added detailed descriptions of each item.

\---------------------------------------

If you’re new to Data Analysis… Welcome! Glad you have you :).

People learn data analysis skills in different ways. Maybe you’ve done some courses, tutorials, certifications or even a whole degree. You’re either working on creating a portfolio or you’ve received your very first dataset and real world questions to answer  – congratulations!

At this point, it can be totally normal to think: 

>*“Ok, how do I begin analysing this dataset? How exactly am I supposed to start? Help!”*

Cue some mild panic and hint of existential dread.

I’ve seen many a reddit-thread where people feel lost without the structure of learning material to guide them. It can be easy to feel like you’re not making any progress in your learning when you stumble at the very start of applying your knowledge in the real world. 

When you first receive a dataset outside of a structured course, it can be really confusing about where to start because you could start anywhere, and you could head in any direction. 

>*Don’t worry – you’ve got this!*

Whatever training you’ve had up until now will move you forward in your analysis. What I’ll help you with today is not Step 1 of your analysis, but what I think of as Step 0 – Getting to know your dataset. 

It’s tempting to dive straight into analyses because it feels like it’s the “real work” but rest-assured, getting to know your dataset IS real work and will pay off massively in steering your analyses to useful results. You’ll be able to provide others with guidance on what questions can or can’t be answered and you’ll have a better idea of how to interpret the results. 

What I’ll present you with here is a checklist of ways in which you can get to know the dataset you’re working with. Take this with you in your first, fiftieth or hundred-and-fiftieth analysis – it’ll always work. The more you can check off, the better your understanding of the data and analyses will be. As you gain experience a lot of this will become second nature. 

The basis of this approach is to give you a solid mental reference point of the data and will be your first mental model of what it represents. Once you’ve got this reference point, you’ll feel a lot more confident about what step 1 of your analysis should be. It’s like finding a landmark in an unfamiliar part of town and suddenly you have a better idea about where you are and what direction you should be going. 

 

The basis of this approach is to give you a solid mental reference point of the data and will be your first mental model of what it represents. Once you’ve got this reference point, you’ll feel a lot more confident about what step 1 of your analysis should be. It’s like finding a landmark in an unfamiliar part of town and suddenly you have a better idea about where you are and what direction you should be going. 

Use the table of contents below as a checklist and then read on for more detailed descriptions of each.

* Storage format
* File size (kB, MB, GB)
* Number of rows and columns
* Data types
* Quick scan of first 10 rows
* Age of dataset and how often it’s updated
* Purpose of the dataset
* Who uses it now?
* How was the data collected?
* For databases, where is the ERD?
* Is there a data dictionary? Does it look accurate?
* How descriptive are the headers?
* Who is the custodian of the dataset? How are they maintaining it?
* Do the headers match the data in them?
* How much of the data is missing?
* Can you see numbers like 999, 9999 in values?
* Cleanliness rating
* Distribution of values, counts, averages, min/max
* Verify with a domain expert

This advice is based on my own experience, but is by no means exhaustive. People who work with different datasets than I do will have different views, but I think this applies well to many situations. 

### Storage format

I’d expect most datasets, if presented in a file, to be in a CSV (Comma Separated Variables) or Excel (XLS or XLSX) format. 

If there’s some other weird or proprietary format that I don’t recognise, that would indicate I might have trouble opening the file, reading the contents correctly or finding help on issues and I may have to budget in extra time for converting the file, or finding a way of converting it to a more usable format. 

### File size (kB, MB, GB)

I’d expect smaller datasets to have smaller file sizes, and larger ones to have larger. Most datasets in files I’ve dealt with are in the 1- 50MB range. If I saw an excel file with over 100MB, I’d know there’s a lot going on in that workbook that could make working with it tricky. There’s probably a lot of formulas or analysis happening and I would see if I can separate out just the data I need into a new workbook or CSV. 

Large excel files can be temperamental and have a habit of crashing systems or being very slow to load. An excel file can become corrupted at any time. 

Anything geospatial, especially satellite imagery, can be very large.  If you see file sizes in the GB range, its very likely you’ll need more specialised ways of working with it. It’s good to research how to handle such large files for your needs. For example with satellite imagery, you may need to work via cloud-based virtual machines and some sort of distributed storage and processing (I’m guessing). For CSVs, you may need particular plugins or packages that can access this data without crashing your system. 

### Number of rows and columns

So, how many rows and columns are we looking at? 500 rows? 5 000? 500 000? The order of magnitude will give me a sense of how much data has been collected and what might be possible to analyse in a few scenarios. 

Example: If I was given a dataset of the income streams of all adults in the USA, but it only  had 500 rows of data I’d know it’s likely a dataset of aggregations, and I won’t be able to dive into very granular analysis.

Example: If this dataset were the spending habits of several families over the course of a few years, and there were 500 000 rows, I’d immediately think that this is probably extremely granular detail and there’ll be a lot of angles to look at. 

When it comes to columns (the variables), then a high number of them might tell me a few things. Firstly I expect there to be much fewer columns (variables) vs rows (observations). Let’s say 10, 20 or maybe even 50 columns. When it starts going higher, like 200 columns – that would give me cause for concern in that either the data isn’t structured well, or there’s metadata incorporated into the column names perhaps (harder to extract meaning). Of course there are many exceptions to this but they are more unusual than usual. 

### Data types

What data is contained in each column? Are they mostly numeric (decimals, whole numbers), text (free text, categories), dates and/times (formatting?), true/false (boolean). 

Are the datatypes correct e.g. is a date column actually have the date in it formatted as a date (22-01-2019) or is it actually text (string) format of the date (in which case there could be issues and errors when that was converted)? Does the formatting match what you’d expect e.g. if there’s meant to be a column (variable) with numerical data, is it really a number (e.g. 6000) or a text representation of that (“6k”) – assuming it’s not the spreadsheet software’s own visual formatting that you’re looking at. 

In short, if the data types match the data each column (variable) is meant to contain, you’re off to a good start. If not, tread carefully. 

### Quick scan of first 10 rows

Have a look at the data in the first 10 or 50 or 100 rows and scan over it. Does this data make any sense? Hopefully it will. Are numbers in the same order of magnitude as you’d expect? Are there any easy to spot correlations that make sense? For a dataset on personal wealth you might expect rows (observations) with high salaries to also have high home values.  

### Age of dataset and how often it’s updated

Datasets might be a live stream of information or as in many cases, it’s static and published on a specific date. Static datasets might be updated in a number of ways:

* Repeatedly updated and published as new datasets
* Single dataset gets updated i.e. there aren’t separate files published for each update
* Regular scheduled updates
* Scheduled updates that never end up happening (project is abandoned)
* Updates that happen but only for a specific period with a known or eventual end to the updates. 

And then some datasets are never updated, they were always meant to be a one-time publication.

The age of the dataset will often matter, because you need to gauge how useful the dataset is based on whether it’s outdated for your needs. 

If I want to estimate how many ice cream parlours could be supported by communities in a region, I would need relatively recent census data. Population estimates from 50 years ago would likely not be very useful for me today – for this particular analysis. 

Knowing the age of the dataset and how often it gets updated go hand-in-hand when it comes to being able to provide advice on how reliable the analysis might be, whether you can repeat the analysis in future and what follow up questions can be answered. 

### Purpose of the dataset

When the data was collected, what was the initial purpose? The more aligned that original purpose is with your current needs, the more useful that dataset is likely to be. 

Assume I want to help figure out the prevalence of stray dogs in a city and their effect on public health. A dataset (or datasets) that were collected specifically targeting the same questions, holding information like dog bite injuries in ER, prevalence of rabies, animal control callouts might all be more useful than related datasets of dog licence registration that only tell how many licenced pets there are in different areas. 

### Who uses it now?

This may or may not be tied to the original purpose of the dataset, but understanding who currently uses the dataset (if anyone) will be useful to know from a few angles, but primarily I like to know who I could ask questions of and what future developments might be coming. Perhaps there’s a sales team that uses the data extensively in dashboards and reports. If you know that they’re shifting strategy to measure targets that require new data to be captured in the database, maybe existing data points will be retired.

### How was the data collected?

Is this survey data? Online collection or in person? Trained enumerators or volunteers? Device data from web analytics? Email tracking pixels? Telemetry data from automated systems? Was there data validation upon entry or capture? Has the data gone through any cleaning or preparation between the point of collection and now?

The answers to these questions may be hard to get and you’ll probably pick up bits of information about each dataset as you work with it and gain experience. Over time you’ll get a good overview of how data flows from the point of capture to being ready for analysis, and all the ways it might get lost, changed or how it must be interpreted slightly (or very) differently from what the header, code book or data dictionary specifies. 

Take survey data for example. The same question being asked might be responded to very differently depending on factors like whether it was an in-person or online self-completed questionnaire, whether participants were incentivised to answer or not, whether they were asked in their own language or via translation, from a trained professional enumerator or from an untrained volunteer, in the presence of others or alone, anonymously or not.

### For databases, where is the ERD?

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is key in understanding a database, the tables, fields and datatypes present and how they all relate to one another. 

This goes well together with a Data Dictionary. 

### Is there a data dictionary? Does it look accurate?

A data dictionary will give more detail on the ERD and be easier to search and navigate as it’s in document form, but ideally the data dictionary and ERD go hand in hand. Many databases do not come with a database dictionary but creating one and keeping it updated can be one of your first really valuable additions to any team. 

### How descriptive are the headers?

If the headers have very descriptive names, like “device” , “address”, “owner” you’re going to have a much easier time figuring out what the data is saying  than if you have “XB206\_XT”. Non-obvious headings will take a while to figure out and hopefully there is some pattern to their naming convention, but this is not always the case. 

### Who is the custodian of the dataset? How are they maintaining it?

Whose responsibility is it to maintain the dataset? Who looks after it? What do they do to maintain consistency between updates? How strict are the protocols for ensuring headers retain consistent meanings (hopefully very strict!). These questions help you identify how much trust you can put in the analyses you produce. It’s not unheard of, and not even that uncommon, for datasets to not be properly governed, with definitions and input requirements changing without any control – leading to someone needing a lot of tacit knowledge passed down from one analyst to another to avoid non-obvious issues. 

### Do the headers match the data in them?

It can happen that somewhere in data capture or transformation from to the dataset you’re seeing that something has happened which assigned the wrong column name (variable header) to the wrong column (variable) , so it’s worth a quick check to see if “First Name” actually looks like it contains people names, and not maybe a street address for example. 

I haven’t seen this happen often, but I have seen it.

### How much of the data is missing?

For each variable, check how many of the rows have data for it. In most cases, you want there to be very little (or no) missing data. In other cases, you may expect that a lot of data is missing. This check is really critical because it will have a large impact on what it is you can actually analyse. 

If a dataset of 20 000 train delays only has the train operator completed for 200 of those records, then it’s unlikely you can perform any meaningful analysis comparing train operator performance. 

### Can you see numbers like 999, 9999 in values?

Sometimes when numerical data is being captured, there’s a need to capture that the data is missing for one or more reasons, and then numbers like “999” or “9999” or something similar are used to denote that it’s missing for a specific reason  – as opposed to an NA value which might mean it’s was just never collected, asked for or available. . 

These uses of actual numbers as a form of additional data representation inside a variable that houses regular numeric data can skew your analysis results if you don’t filter them out and it’s not obvious that they’re there – you’ll have to look for them. 

Sometimes you’ll have a code book or a data dictionary that goes along with the dataset which should hopefully highlight that these values exist and what they denote. 

A similar occurrence in geographic coordinates is the use of 0 latitude and 0 longitude, referred to as “[Null Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island)”.

### Cleanliness rating

How clean the data needs will change from one analysis to another, but you will encounter many datasets that are quite “dirty” and need a lot of cleaning before you can make them work. What do I mean by dirty data and what does cleaning it involve?

There are countless ways in which data can be dirty, but I’ll list some common ones that come to mind. 

* Free text entry where a dropdown options should have been used. You’ll find countless spelling variations of “Mississippi” and you’ll need to transform them all to the correct spelling. 
* Dates and times captured in different formats need alignment.
* Wrong data types captured e.g. numbers are stored as text and need to be converted. 
* Values entered in the wrong order of magnitude e.g data is captured in metric tonnes rather than kilograms. 
* Some values don’t make sense e.g.  a person’s age is 300 years old and that has to be removed. 
* Issues in recoding of special characters in text &quo& and must be removed or  converted back to it’s original representation. 

This is just a taste of some of the issues you’ll face. Personally I find sleuthing and cleaning quite enjoyable but this is often a key reason why just being able to jump into an analysis right away is not possible. You need to build in some allowance for data cleaning.

### Distribution of values, counts, averages, min/max

This will be your first look at the range of data available. For each variable, look at the frequency of values, the distribution of maximum and minimum values and the interquartile ranges. You may even want to have a first look at the correlation of any variables that you think should be obviously correlated. 

This is how I get a feel for the “size and shape” of this data and how much variation there is. In some cases you might expect lots of variation, or might expect very little – or have no expectation at all. That’s ok – you’re just familiarising yourself with the landscape. 

### Verify with a domain expert

Once you’ve got a feel for the dataset, it helps to verify some of your initial findings with a domain expert i.e. someone who is familiar with the content (or “business” side). If you were looking at facilities data, it would be good to check with the Facilities Manager if what you’re finding looks correct. For example, the Facilities Manager might know that there’s a lot of renovation work that’s happened but no one from the admin team have been recording the changes, so most of the data is likely right (building location, footprint size, utility providers etc) but there’ll be some data that’s probably wrong or out of date (value of fixtures and fittings, high risk materials, state of fire suppression systems to name a few).

## Now you know your data!

Having just completed some or all of the checklist, you’ll be one of the few people on earth who understands this dataset as well as you do! 

You’re in a good position to start analysing this data – either by answering questions you’ve been asked or by following the sparks of interest you’ve just had. 

And did you notice something? You’ve actually already begun the analysis! Missing values, distributions, counts, averages – all are useful and valuable info. Even answers like “I don’t know / It’s hard to say” are useful outcomes of the exercise. They’ll inform discussions about the way forward. 

Congrats! Now, back to some analysis :). ",39,5,oscarb1233,2022-05-05 06:56:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/uirkg5/youve_just_received_your_first_dataset_to_analyse/,0,dataanalysis

vy4now,Is it expected for you to make a counter offer after receiving an initial job offer?,"I was recently offered an entry level position on a data analyst team and the salary offered was at my minimum acceptable salary. I countered with a 10% increase and have yet to receive a reply, or even an acknowledgement of my counter. When I follow the link that was provided to view the initial offer, the offer letter is gone and I see the message ""Offer Unavailable.""

Salary range was not listed in the job posting and it was never discussed in any of the interviews, so it's not like I had a chance beforehand to negotiate starting salary. I figured they might remove the offer during the negotiation phase, but I expected at least some semblance of an acknowledgement of my counter. It has now been roughly 24 hours since the initial offer and still nothing. Did I screw myself for not accepting their first offer? Or should I calm down and wait? This will be my first ""big"" job, but I have been told that negotiating starting salary is acceptable, and almost expected of you.

EDIT: Should I reach out to the person who sent the offer letter? I don't want to seem desperate but I also want this job. I'm just extremely surprised that after 24 hours there is no acknowledgement of my counter. Like I said, I do not have experience negotiating salary though so I don't know if this is normal.

vkfwif,Is your analytics department losing a bunch of people too?,"I just left my company as senior data analyst to pursue a data scientist position and found out that with my leaving they are now down 33%.  They are budgeted for 45 analysts and managers, but only have 30 slots filled.

From what I understand, almost all of the loses are from senior analysts and managers, mostly senior analysts.  We were never the highest payers, but always had an advantage in terms of benefits and work/life balance.  However, once other companies started paying significantly more  AND offered 100% remote options that advantage went out the window and people have been leaving in droves.

The big challenge is in filling the positions.  They can fill the manager positions internally (even with people who have no analytics experience), but are having a heck of a time replacing the senior analysts.  There are a TON of potential junior analysts with no experience begging to be hired, but the quality seniors are few and far between.

I currently live in the UK and work as a data analyst (specificall R and power bi skills) I'm currently earning £48k. I am considering a move to dubai not for financial gain, but more lifestyle change. However I'm not sure what sort of salary I could expect there. I am 2 years in industry.

I would like to also know what the average top end salary would be  for a highly experienced analyst, say 10 years in industry, just to gauge what the max potential is.

Thanks if anyone can help",38,38,SeveralLetterhead,2024-01-04 13:27:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/18yd5u4/data_analyst_salary_in_dubai/,0,dataanalysis

zrb01s,I did it. Offer accepted today. Here's my story and advice.,"Get ready for a long one guys as I want to lay out my journey from starting in this field and how I did it to hopefully help you all in your job search as well.

Background:

I think I may have a bit of a different background to most posts I've seen looking for help on this sub, but not by any means unique. I graduated college in the beginning of 2011 with a degree in Business Management with a focus in Finance, specifically business valuation and investments. Out of college I struggled to get a job in the field of that degree so opted to enter an industry I love, automotive in this case. I started working an retailer and quickly worked my way up at the store level and stayed there for nearly a decade. A better opportunity came up at a local dealership and I held both a sales and service role there until the pandemic started, when I was laid off. At that time my first child was just a few months old so this, in a way, was a blessing in disguise and gave me the opportunity to stay at home with them. Throughout my time at home I knew I would eventually need to go back to the workplace as the kids (we had a second), grew up and would end up going to school/daycare. I reverted back to some of the things that interested me in college which was the valuation part of my degree and using programs like R and Excel to come to conclusions. As I researched options, DA came up quite often and I decided to take advantage of the Google Data Analytics course and see how it peaked my interest.

Data Analyst Process:

Upon completion, my interest was most definitely peaked and I started to apply for jobs and continue taking some of the other courses to polish and expand on my skills. I was spending anywhere from three to four, to as much as 8 hours a day practicing and working on the courses I was taking, while again, constantly applying for jobs. As I was working through, I was consuming YT content on how to brake into this career field and learned quite a few things. Optimizing your LinkedIn profile and resume were key in my case. I was about to shift from coursework to building a portfolio when I started getting approached by some recruiters through LinkedIn, some of which were bogus or had very poor reviews. Being that this part started in early November, the process was quite slow due to the upcoming holiday and that some of the legit offers were companies in which the year-end holiday's were their ""busy season"". So for context, the opportunity I took, my initial contact with the recruiter was early to mid November, and I just accepted the offer today, and it is a bit above the average pay range.

Conclusion:

My biggest piece of advice is, if you are serious about this career and are passionate about the work you will be doing, NOT the pay, keep at it and continue to practice and learn new skills, and don't be complacent with your image in the career networking space.  Continually evolve and take in new advice and information to better present yourself to employers. In my case, I applied to over 170-180 jobs according to my log, which I'm sure I didn't include some. I would say I officially began my job search in early August of this year, so it does take time if you are also in a career shift like I am. There were a couple opportunities I passed on because they were a great fit for the season of life I'm in, but as much as you can, don't sacrifice or cut yourself short too much when considering an offer. If it's not right, it's not right.

Lastly, regardless of your previous experience, find a way to relate it to Data Analysis. Use and practice the STAR method on in your resume and in interviews. If you don't know, in general, it means 'what was the problem, what was your approach, and what were the results. Even if you don't think the first call you get is the right fit, use it as a chance to practice your interview skills. You can always say ""No"".

I hope this helps one of you out there. Special thanks to a lot of you who got their shot before me and made a post like this discussing their experience. It was a big help and made me think differently as I hadn't had to look for a job in nearly 15 years. If you all need help, I'm willing to. as much as I can, reply with advice to your specific situation either through DM's or replies. Either way, good luck and keep slaying it.",36,12,svtbuckeye11,2022-12-21 05:07:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/zrb01s/i_did_it_offer_accepted_today_heres_my_story_and/,0,dataanalysis

uw313n,Would anyone be interested in trying our data tool out? It can automatically generate SQL scripts from the data transformations created in a spreadsheet-like UI.,"In my 10+ years of work-life involved with data, there have been two pain points for me. First, there is no tool for everyone in a company who wants quickly get answers by themselves. Excel is familiar to almost everyone, but the data size limit, data accessibility, organization of transformations, and collaboration capability are not good enough. Second,  the data team is exhausted by the shit mountain of the SQL and other data transformation codes. Besides, the unclear requirements in emails, talking, and documents from business teams also are dragging down the data team. They have no time to do more valuable work such as improving infrastructures, data quality, data governance, etc.

Last year, my best friends and I started building a data tool that everyone could access and deal with large datasets (up to GB-level by now) without technical support in a spreadsheet-like UI. And our tool organizes the data transformations in a clear and self-expressed way.. Moreover, our product can automatically translate the data transformations to SQL compatible with many databases, data warehouses, and data lakes.

Would anyone be interested in giving it a spin? We have upgraded the product several times based on our initial test users' suggestions and got positive feedback from a big company in real and complex use cases. Now, we want to get more advice and feedback.

18gpuyl,Do I Continue Working My Current 9-5?,"As the title states, I am questioning whether or not it is still worth being at my current job at an advertising agency due to many reasons. The main one is due to the fact I am transitioning into data analytics as a current marketing graduate after falling in love with the field and want to become more involved with likeminded individuals.  However, one of the the biggest problems here is that there is a zero opportunity to grow in the field or gain experience as I am stuck completing meaningless tasks that could otherwise be done with the help of ML or artificial intelligence. In short, this company lacks the ability to adapt to market trends and the company culture revolves around a toxic bureaucracy where nobody values insightful suggestions and there is miscommunication in every stage of the process.

I have been with this company for two years, and while I am grateful for the opportunity to get myself started in the workforce, there has been almost a complete stop in the opportunity to grow and learn more**(not to mention the salary is almost a joke when taking the average into account for my position)**. Additionally, with my transition into the field of data analytics I am always trying to find new ways to implement ideas and strategies that can benefit the agency, including building a relational database that can retrieve historical data from past campaigns to make data-driven decisions for future ones, utilize cloud computing services that can streamline workflow processes, and more that I believe can be extremely beneficial, but at the end of the day I am always shut down by higher ups because once again, this company is reluctant to change and wants to run with outdated practices that revolve around feelings and not data. 

Nevertheless, this job has also given me another opportunity. Time. At my job, I am able to finish a majority of my work before lunch and have the rest of the day to sit around and wait for updates that need to be made in campaigns. So with this extra time I have been reading books and taking courses in data analytics, SQL, Python, and more to expand my knowledge and learn the fundamentals and tools necessary to excel in this field.

However, while this has been going on for sometime, I have reached a point where the people have gotten more toxic than ever, I am being micromanaged and am really starting to resent this place when I come in. So now I am here, asking for career advice. I have been told numerous times it is unwise to leave my job as it will look bad when interviewing for future ones and staying here will help secure my finances, but now, more than ever, I have been spending day and night, studying, learning, and striving to be included in the action that is data. One thing to mention to is the endless applications and very few interviews I have had trying to find an entry level data analyst position or maybe even an opportunity that will allow me to work with these tools and programming languages to really make a change. Maybe I just need the reassurance my job here is providing me the opportunity to learn and be paid in the process, but a part of me also feels like I can take the chains off my ankles to study more, create case studies, apply to more jobs and one day land a job that would be in this field.

I'm struggling so much. Across social media, people were talking about a ""September Surge."" I haven't seen any glimmer of hope regarding that. My next option is to either lower my expectations (even more) about pay - or sell my soul again by taking a position in social media analytics. I truly hate social media analytics position because it requires me to be active on social media and it's terrible for my mental health. 

\+ the ridiculousness of inflation, more expensive groceries, more expensive gas - I don't know what to do anymore. I don't think it helps that I entered the analytics job market in 2020 when things were basically booming. Maybe this is just a mindset adjustment.

wb6ylf,3 Months Into This Insights Analyst Role and I Feel Like I'm Out of My Depth.,"Tl;dr - I started an insights analyst job in May and I can't shake the worry that I have a skills gap between what I did in my last job and what this new job requires. With no one senior above me doing something similar, I'm unsure who to turn to. Should I tell my boss that I'm feeling this way, or how should I proceed?

&#x200B;

Started this job in May. Was a huge opportunity for me in a career sense as it was a big step up, and also a major step up in terms of pay. My previous role was a general marketing insights executive, working under my senior manager. I would do things like take survey outputs and identify themes over what people were saying, or comparing different customer types across various sentiments i.e. very basic data analysis. I've got 1.5 years of professional experience up to taking this job.

The first interview with this company they asked me had I done the technical aspect to the job (working with/ building reporting dashboards) to which I gave a vague yes (working with) but no (have not built) answer. The second round interview was a 20 min chat with the CPO that didn't test anything on my ability to do the role. Applied not really thinking I would get the job but lo and behold I got the offer after the 2 interviews.

Now 3 months into the job I can't shake the feeling that I have a major skills gap in what's required to do this role successfully. I keep trying to make workarounds to the reports via Excel that really need SQL/ Data Studio expertise which I am slowly learning, but do not have full analyst proficiency at present.

This is a new role that the company has never had before as they are a startup that's only starting to mature now. There is no one senior above me so I'm pretty much on my own when it comes to questions.

Have thought about enrolling in online data analysis courses to try and bridge the gap myself which I definitely think can play a part, but I think without someone senior to report into there will always be a gap that I cannot fill. It's starting to make me anxious as I don't want to be a deadweight team member but I also worry that I may have misrepresented myself during the interview process with the technical yes/no answer.

My boss hasn't said anything to make me feel like I could be let go anytime soon but I have asked him for some feedback as we approach the 3 month mark which is scheduled for 2 weeks time. I've voiced before in our 121's that I do feel a level of discomfort with the difference in my skills gap and the ambiguity of a startup (my previous job was the established BigCorp they are disrupting) and my boss has said that this will go away with time, but it has not.

All of this is really starting to take a toll on how competent I feel at work. This is a very technical job which I have never done before. I feel like I could get there with the right training and senior support but I also think that maybe this just isn't for me and I should quit.

Should I tell my boss I'm feeling this way or just try my best to fake it (data analyst courses outside of work hours) till I make it?",37,19,cgshore,2022-07-29 14:57:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/wb6ylf/3_months_into_this_insights_analyst_role_and_i/,0,dataanalysis

Cut to the chase: I cannot give a flying fuck about looking at data to help someone sell more plastic crap. I don't care about trends in past data to game customers into buying more stupid shit they probably don't need.

I want to (and am) learning to code and DA but really lose all the motivation when all of the courses seem to have such trite and low impact examples of what the industry looks like.

Does anyone have any examples of courses that is more heavily directed into doing meaningful work with DA and coding?

11sgb8s,Tableau Developer Interview Study Guide and Prep Advice,"Tableau Developer Interview Study Guide

I have had quite a few Tableau developer interviews and passed.  Additionally,  I was asked to put together a questions list to test a candidates knowledge. I saw a lot of stuff on the net around basic questions that no one would really ask in an interview. 

In my experience these interview are given by a tech person  or  manager who has little experience with the Tableau. So their purpose is to see if you can solve the problems they are facing, hear your experience with the product and see a portfolio.  A lot the questions that are asked are:

Do you have experience using Tableau with X to do X? 

For Example: 

 Do you have any experience connecting Tableau to databases, live connections or APIs?  

 Have you ever had to migrate Tableau dashboards or reports from one environment to another?  

These questions  that allow you to expound on your knowledge and is probably a issue that they are facing.  I have never been asked simplistic questions around the product. 

So I put together a study guide on how to pass these interviews with experience based questions. You can find it here: [https://absentdata.com/tableau/tableau-interview-questions/](https://absentdata.com/tableau/tableau-interview-questions/)

z4wp8d,"(Need Help) If the Google Data Analytics Course is not enough to help me up my chances in the job market, then what is?","Hi all,

I'm currently a senior at an undergrad majoring in Economics and am expected to graduate in 3 months. I started the google data analytics course and I'm still at the middle of course 2 and there really is no other excuse other than my lack of time management and trying to bump my overall GPA to a 3.0 as I am right under that threshold right now.

Now, I'm in a very lost spot and wanted to seek some advice.

One big reason that I think I am not progressing in my Google Data Analytics course is that I don't find the early lectures to be all too entertaining as it is mainly going over what a data analyst tackles and the teaching you the soft skills and what specific questions you will be asking once you do become an analyst. It's not that I'm not interested and want to switch to a different field at all. I came into this course expecting to dive fully into the hard skills and start learning them. 

I just know that I need those skills so badly and was wondering if I should *skip to course 4* and revisit the first three courses. But, I guess I just need to power through and get to course 4 ASAP as I heard that is where the fun begins.

I am not expecting this to be a free-pass to land a job in the data analyst/business analyst field, but I thought the capstone project at the end would be a huge plus to add to my resume to up my value, but I remember seeing posts here that that alone is not enough.

So, this brings me to my actual question. **What else should I be doing? Should I only focus on the google course and aim to finish ASAP and do school simultaneously and once that is done, should I start learning a Python course since the Google DA doesn't teach (maybe preferably with a certificate) and another SQL course to strengthen my learnings?**

I have a background in Excel and I obtained the Microsoft Office Specialist Excel Expert certificate to prove that on my resume but that was also 2 years ago and to be quite frank I am a bit rusty right now. This also led me to slacking on applying to internship positions as I know I am not actually skilled for the jobs. This is bad and I need to fix it.

Along with GPA and one leadership position I am holding in an extracurricular org in school, I'm still going to finish the Google DA course as soon as possible, **but I want to know what else I need to be doing right now that I can achieve in the next 2-3 months so I can transition smoothly into a full time position as an analyst role? (I do not have any internship experience)**

eyu93p,Anyone needs a tutor for learning data analysis?,"Hi guys. 

I have 4 years experience in data analysis.   
I am pretty good at writing SQL queries, wrangling data in Python and creating BI dashboards with Tableau. 

I've moved to USA (Cincinnati) recently, and I am still waiting for my work permit.   
So basically I am unemployed right now (and for the next couple of month probably too) and boredom is driving me crazy.   
Also I am non-native speaker, and absolutely unfamiliar with US culture, so I am afraid that would be an issue for my future employment / socialization. 

If anyone needs tutor / mentor in learning SQL, python for data analysis or Tableau I would me more than happy to help you in exchange for some language practice (for example 45 minutes of coding and 45 minutes of talking on random topics in a 1.5 hour skype call).

18x23l6,Turned down a data analyst job today.,"Hello,

I currently work as a ServiceNow developer. Recently, I made the decision to decline an analytics job offer, despite it having similar remote work arrangements and only a slightly higher salary. The offer was particularly enticing as I got 0 experience with analytics and PowerBI, presenting a valuable learning opportunity. However, I opted not to pursue it.

Now, I find myself contemplating whether I made the right choice and wondering if I decide to explore data analyst positions in the future, will there still be interest in hiring me despite my limited experience in the field? Was the offer I turned down a rare opportunity, or are there likely to be similar opportunities available in the future?",30,25,lalybay,2024-01-02 22:15:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/18x23l6/turned_down_a_data_analyst_job_today/,0,dataanalysis

Another thing that changed this year was the introduction of Rule 6- career entry questions are relegated to the monthly megathread. From the mods perspective this has been a massive success related to the quality of the posts. The monthly average number of posts not approved is 720 vs. 357 that are approved. The mod team has to manually review these posts, and I can tell you the vast majority violate rule 6.

106mrgc,tips for a quality DA portfolio?,"I'm an aspiring data analyst and I have a few questions about how to present and share portfolio projects. If you're experienced or semi-experienced in the field, could you help me out with these issues?

* I'm primarily using Python. Is it conventional to share your project in the form of a Jupyter notebook so you can explain your thinking process here and there throughout the script, or do people post a package with modules? I'm somewhat less familiar with the latter and frankly have not been doing a ton of OOP (I do it when something seems obviously reusable, but other than that, no. However, I could figure this out and restructure my code if that's the necessary convention for portfolio presentation.)
* Should my portfolio showcase code (like I was assuming in the first bullet) or is it actually supposed to be showcasing 'deliverables' like a report with business recommendations, presentation slides, a Tableau dashboard, etc? I am a career changer and would like to lean into my communication/presentation skills and ability to synthesize info as a strength, but I am not sure whether the portfolio is a place for that or if I should just be presenting code there.
* I was presuming I'd be posting on github and possibly also sharing my tableau public link. Is this normal/is there a better option?
* Regarding SQL: I am using mysql-connector in python so there are bits of SQL in some of my portfolio projects, but is there a different/better way to showcase SQL skills? I've been using SQL queries while doing EDA in pandas, so the queries have been relatively straightforward (not showing use of temp tables, CTEs, etc.) What does a SQL portfolio project look like?
* It would be really helpful for me to see data analyst portfolios that are strong so I can understand the conventions of how to present portfolios. Do you know or any examples or are you willing to share your own?

Lastly, is there a discord or slack or anything like that where I can ask questions about my work here and there and get help?

I said ""I'd get a record of how many children will attend the party, their age ranges, if they have any dietary requirements, ensure that its a safe area to play in so for example no sharp objects""

""what else?""

""I'd ensure that there are activities such as piñatas and activities for the kids to play, if there are say 30 kids attending the party I'd ensure there are 30 plates worth of food, plus maybe atleast an extra 30 plates as most children will have their parents and carers attend""

""so how would you ensure you have everything you need""

""I'd ensure I have a checklist to keep a record of those who have attended the party/I have a record of all the things I planned for the party have been fulfilled""

This question really made me panic and I felt like I was waffling.

Please give me an honest review of how my answer was, and if it was bad then what would the interviewers have been looking for?

I was in the middle of a course in Coursera, one that would provide me with a certificate upon completion.

I then contacted support who told me I had been unsubscribed, even tough I never asked to be, and that I should just subscribe again and would not lose my progress. 

However, when I try to subscribe again the prices are now higher. Support asked me to understand that they adjust the price as they see how much value the course provides.

How can I understand that? It seems extremely unethical and dodgy that they would do something like this. Anyway, is there anyway I can protect myself against this?

* Graduated from University in 2021 with a degree in economics

* Sadly, only work experience comes from the service job I'm currently working
* No internship experience

Should I keep grinding projects?  Is there anything I can do to make myself a more competitive candidate?  Or do I just need to keep going at it and hope something sticks?  At this point I'm just feeling pretty lost and was hoping to get some direction on how I can move forward.

w3yrp3,Why does everyone want to do data analytics/ science?,"I’m sure this has been answered before but what’s the deal with everyone shifting to this field? I don’t want to sound like I’m gatekeeping because I truly believe anyone can make it in this field; I’m also just starting out myself. That being said, I’ve been told by multiple friends now that they’re doing or have done the google analyst certification and are looking to change careers to data. I’m seeing the same thing on this subreddit. While it’s awesome that the field is growing, it baffles me that so many people are almost expecting to get into this field without a technical background and one certificate and no portfolio even thought the course tells you to create one to help with finding a job. It’s obvious that the attractive salary and job variety is very enticing, but I don’t think most people understand how competitive entry positions are, let alone the time needed to be truly proficient in a relevant language and software. Again, I don’t mean to be discouraging but after extensively reviewing the general criteria needed for this career: technical degree, even MBA most of the time, hard technical  skills, experience, etc, I think people are in for a rude awakening.

llen9v,The biggest thing I wish I was told when I started,"I've been working with data for about 5 years now.

The number of ways something can be done incorrectly and not noticed is the most profound impression I've had.

*The biggest piece of advice I could give is this*:

1. **Assume all of your data operations and assumptions\* are wrong**.
2. **Re-examine your operations and assumptions with systematic scrutiny\*\*.**
3. **Then, move on with confidence after fixing errors.**

\* Assumptions of business processes, behavior of data columns, cleanliness of data, etc.

\*\* See my comment for examples of systematic scrutiny.

The trouble with analysis is that it's not very self-checking. If you had an error in any piece of query, code, formula or data assumption then everything built on that is wrong. And if you only run the analysis once, you will not know it. Unless your final output can be compared to an objective, known value, then each step you take should be double checked!

Do not build work on an unknown mistake upstream in your workflow!

Just a random thought! Hope it helps someone.",31,3,None,2021-02-16 21:52:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/llen9v/the_biggest_thing_i_wish_i_was_told_when_i_started/,0,dataanalysis

There are 2 issues: 
1. It’s a brand new position and I am going to have to build everything out from scratch. I have a business background and my data experience is some cursory experience with powerBI, working on 1 data project as a Business Analyst intern, and dealing with marketing analytics as a business owner.

17fdyg1,"If you want to practice your Data Analysis skills, I recommend the freeCodeCamp projects","# [LINK TO THE COURSE, PROJECTS NEAR THE BOTTOM](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/)

I have seen several posts asking for ideas for data analysis projects and I thought it would be a good opportunity to share my experience with the projects from freeCodeCamp.

There are 5 projects in total, all of them are in Python and use the following libraries:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scipy

For most of the projects you will be provided with a .csv file that you need to analyze to answer some questions and plot some charts.

The projects are quite challenging as you need to return the insights and charts in the exact format as it is requested. The projects are based on unit tests, so you don't have room for slight variations.

Upon completion of these 5 projects you will receive a certificate that you can share in LinkedIn.

That being said, I have a few tips for those that want to give those projects a shot.

You are expected to submit the solutions of the  projects using Replit. My advice is to NOT use Replit for developing your projects but instead do it locally as the free tier of Replit struggles a lot when installing Matplotlib.

Once you have finished your solution locally and have passed the unit tests you can copy it to the Replit editor and submit it to freeCodeCamp.

You can find the project templates in the freeCodeCamp's GitHub account: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp

You don't need to install Git or have a GitHub account to access them, just find the project, click the green button and select 'Download ZIP'.

If you get stuck in a project, the unit tests will tell you where is the error, I recommend to take a look at the source code of the tests so you can understand what they expect.

Graduated with a BS in Bio in May 2020, working as a MT/MLS with a lot of Excel-heavy tools that put me through a crash course of functions, formulas, pivot tables, and putting together reports. Went through the Google Data Analytics Certificate, plus a small amount of independent SQL/Python courses on DataCamp. Offer is at a large BioTech company with a local branch for 70k, 6% match and optional hybrid/fully remote!

A lot of things went into my choice to pursue data analytics. Wanting to spend more time doing my hobbies/looking after my health, spending times with my partner and friends, and something I'm immediately excited for: getting rid of the 30-minute commute combined with a 15-minute walk to and from the parking lot (perks of working at a *very* large hospital). But I also learned I had a knack for playing with numbers! This started with pulling, cleaning, and presenting a lot of lab data; time flew, and I steadily improved how I went about it with advanced Excel shenanigans. I heavily leaned on this during my job search.

Very excited for this opportunity; it is actually a decrease in pay when overtime/on call pay is taken into account, but the 401k match (from 0%), lack of commute, and no longer feeling stagnant in my career more than make up for it. I was very transparent about my minimal experience in programming and they made it clear that training would be offered for Python/R/SQL if I wanted to advance beyond Excel! All in all, it feels like a dream come true position wise for an aspiring analyst.

We meet on Google hangouts every 2 weeks or so, and exchange texts/dm’s pretty much every day. I had spent most of my time grinding on Hackerrank, Leetcode and Stratascratch until he told me to start applying about 6-7 weeks ago.

I have 2 more first round interviews next week and I just heard back from a company I interviewed with yesterday, about completing a take home excel assessment.

Suffice it to say , just keep pushing. Not getting interviews? Make tweaks to your resume. Not getting past the first round? Remain confident.

rhmvoz,How to tell stories as a data scientist?," 

Remember as kids, how excited some of us used to get about listening to stories. 

Well, for me, I still am attracted to storytelling. From eagerly waiting for grandma’s stories to creating and telling stories myself, I believe an effective storyteller is someone who can make the readers visualize the plot with just his words.

And similar is the case with **Data storytelling**. 

Follow these 8 commandments of storytelling to learn how to tell stories as a data scientist

8 Commandments of Storytelling with Data

1. **BEGIN WITH A QUESTION**

Set up your story. What is your audience going to learn?

2. **END WITH AN INSIGHT**

If we can’t learn something useful from the data, the story isn’t worth telling.

3. **TELL A COMPELLING STORY**

People remember stories, not data. Take them on your journey.

4. **EXPLAIN WITH VISUALS, NARRATE WITH WORDS**

People understand metrics, trends and patterns better with visuals. Use words to add your voice to the data

5. **BE HONEST AND CREDIBLE**

Our clients value honesty, so don’t sugarcoat the negatives.

6. **BE CLEAR AND CONCISE**

Don’t add anything that is not a part of your story, save it for some other time

7**. KNOW AND CATER TO YOUR AUDIENCE**

Understand their goals and frame your story according to that.

obi8be,Video Game Localization: How to Find Out User Difficulty and Expectations,"Video gaming is fast becoming the most popular recreational past-time globally. With the gaming market reportedly worth $138 billion (USD) in 2018, it has been predicted to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 10%, reaching $180 billion (USD) by 2021.

Therefore, more users around the world want popular games to be translated and adapted to their regions. Reciprocally, there’s a rapid increase in localization, a subsector of the gaming industry. Its goal is to create a smoother playing experience for the end user by taking into account their specific cultural context, while being faithful to the source material.

The problem many game localization companies face, however, is the challenging task of analyzing user reviews for useful insights and to inform the localization process. This costs the company time and money, and delays users from fully enjoying their chosen game.

This article will demonstrate how such analysis can be done efficiently, by looking at a project carried out for Allcorrect as a part of the Data Analyst [Practicum by Yandex bootcamp](https://practicum.yandex.com/?utm_source=pr&utm_medium=content&utm_content=video_game_localization&utm_campaign=pr_content_main_reddit) this year. Specifically, examples of using some popular Python packages for dealing with text data in multiple languages are presented, such as deep\_translator, lang\_detect, and NLTK.

## The data

The data used for the report in this article is provided by Allcorrect. It includes game ID, user score and review text in its original language. The games are on both mobile and PC platforms, which have different user scoring systems. The game IDs have been anonymized.

To prepare for the analysis, reviews that mention localization need to be identified. In this project, there are a total of 140 keywords in 27 languages used to filter the data. One of the challenges in this process is the differences among languages. Users might mention the word 'localization' in their reviews, but use more than one expression in their original language. Therefore, having only one translation for 'localization' in the keywords will miss the reviews containing other expressions.

Using the Chinese language for example, the keywords *Chinese*, *localization* and *English* can be translated as 中文，本土化，英语 respectively. However, in the user reviews, we also find the use of 华语，汉化，英文 to refer to the same concepts. These need to be included in the keywords as not to miss important localization reviews. The same would apply to other languages as well.

Using the keywords to filter the data, slightly over 1% of it was about localization (a total of 152,447 records). In what follows, we will demonstrate how to carry out language detection, translation, and emoji conversion on text data. Then, we'll discuss how to use a logistic regression model to reveal the dynamics of positive and negative reviews. Finally, we'll examine the most common reasons for negative reviews. (Where there are code examples, the variable *reviews* is used to refer to the localization review dataset.)

## Useful packages, tools and functions

Before diving into the details of the analysis, let's briefly introduce the most useful Python packages that were used in the analysis of large texts in multiple languages. This section will list the packages used, as well as some useful functions that readers could modify and use.

**1) langdetect** is a package used for language detection. To apply functions to large dataset, **swifter** is a useful package that will speed up the pandas processing speed. (For more information, click [here ](https://towardsdatascience.com/speed-up-your-pandas-processing-with-swifter-6aa314600a13)) Below you'll find a demonstration of how the two work together.)

    # install the packages 
    !pip install langdetect
    !pip install swifter
     
    # import the packages
    from langdetect import detect
    from langdetect import DetectorFactory
    import swifter
     
    # to avoid unstable results everytime the language detection function is run
    DetectorFactory.seed = 0
     
    # define a function that can be applied to the text column 
    def detect_language(x):
        try:
            language = detect(x)
        except:
            language = 'Other'
        return language
     
    # an example of applying the function using swifter on a dataframe named ""reviews""
    reviews['language'] = reviews['text'].swifter.apply(detect_language)

**2) GoogleTranslator**, from the Python **deep\_translator** package, is a useful tool to translate text reviews. Given that GoogleTranslator does not work when the text exceeds a certain length, when defining the function to apply to dataframe, a try-except would come in handy. (More info on the Python's deep\_translator document can be found, [here ](https://pypi.org/project/deep-translator/).) Below we demonstrate how to use this package to define a function to translate text data.

    # install and import the package
    !pip install -U deep_translator
    from deep_translator import GoogleTranslator
     
    # define the function to translate the text column
    def translate(x):
      try:
         translation = GoogleTranslator(source='auto', target='en').translate(x)
         return translation
      except:
        return ""not translated""

3) **Emojis** are used often in review text data. As these reflect users' feelings, and at times, we may want to keep them. One way to retain such data for text analysis is to convert them into text. This is where the Python package [emoji](https://pypi.org/project/emoji/) comes in handy. The code below demonstrates the process of using this package to define a function to convert the emojis to text data.

    # install and import the package
    !pip install emoji
    import emoji
    from emoji import UNICODE_EMOJI
     
    # define a series of functions 
     
    # first a function that returns True or False the text is an emoji
    def is_emoji(s):
        return s in UNICODE_EMOJI
     
    # define a function that will add space around each emoji
    def add_space(text):
        return ''.join(' ' + char if is_emoji(char) else char for char in text).strip()
     
    # convert emoji to text
    def convert_emojis(text):
        try: 
           return emoji.demojize(text)
        except:
          return text 
     
    # an example of applying the above functions 
    reviews['text'] = reviews['text'].apply(add_space)
    reviews['text'] = reviews['text'].apply(convert_emojis)

The tools described above are just some of the ones that proved useful when preparing the dataset for further analysis. With those in place, let's move on to discuss the analysis.

## Top 10 requested languages and games

Applying the language detection function to the review text column allows us to find out the most popular languages in which the localization reviews are written.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5rd3wn4gkk871.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=998c7ac8635d1031600eb5afcd60a0a93f2df83f

The graph above shows the top 10 languages with the most localization reviews: **simplified Chinese**, **Korean**, **Russian**, **Turkish**, **English**, **Spanish**, **Italian**, **French**, **Thai**, and **Japanese**. Examination of the text data further reveals the prevalence of user requests of local versions or improvement of existing local versions of games in these languages. Such information provides useful insights as to which languages the game localization companies should focus on in their strategic development plans.

We also generated the top 10 games (in terms of the number of their localization reviews) below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ohgmovmkk871.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=16fd151281010cd3f719d277c4e8f895a471d8f1

The graph above shows the games the company should focus on when developing localization plans.

Further analysis of reviews for a particular game should reveal the user's preferences, such as whether the game should be localized in a particular language or that existing localization versions should be improved.

## User sentiments in localization reviews

To distinguish the user sentiment (positive or negative feelings) in the reviews, reviews were assigned as negative (score 1 or 2 for mobile games and 0 for pc), neutral (score 3), and positive (4 or 5 for mobile games and 1 for pc). A breakdown of review sentiments is shown below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0gt56o5qkk871.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=620996cc5ec3e71d3617ceccc6c4d51adb2677bf

Among all the localization reviews, over 65% were positive, approximately 23% were negative, and 11% remained neutral. It's good news that the majority of the reviews mentioning localization are positive. Our focus here is to understand the dynamics of positive and negative reviews, particularly reasons for negative reviews. To that end, the neutral reviews have been removed and 10% of the total data has been sliced and translated, which is used to build a logistic regression model. The resulting dataframe has the following structure:

    ['game_id' 'text' 'score' 'language' 'positive' 'english']

## Examining positive and negative reviews

Having translated the reviews into English and then converted emojis into text, the positive and negative review texts were used to generate wordclouds to highlight any patterns.(Python has a wordcloud library and [here ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generating-word-cloud-python/)is a demonstration of how to use it.) First, a wordcloud for positive reviews.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ge1eupukk871.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=11b4cd8d19eb61f766cf285c3e5551a67982b721

Words such as 'great', 'good', 'fun', 'better' stood out, but words like 'difficult' and 'problem' were also present. Expressions like 'language support', 'turkish language', and 'chinese' indicate the need for specific languages.

Next, let's see the negative reviews wordcloud.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2oc3p6pwkk871.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd12e1655ef2c3b99893b7fc3a3b2d0e572842f1

Again we see words like 'good' stand out. Words such as 'problem', 'bad', 'need', and ""can't"" are likely to indicate issues faced by users.

Despite the above observation, there are no distinct differences in patterns between positive and negative reviews using wordclouds alone. Hence why a logistic model was built to reveal underlying dynamics.

## A logistic regression model to detect positive or negative review patterns

Using a logistic regression model makes interpretation easy and can be learned quickly. It also performs well for the sparse matrix of vectorized words.

The goal of fitting a logistic model here is not to predict the sentiment of reviews, however. It is believed that the score given by the user reflects their satisfaction level more accurately, whereas the role of their text reviews is to provide additional information or explanation. Therefore, the main goal is to reveal the underlying text patterns.

Before using the review text column and the binary positive column to build a simple logistic regression model, the text review column needs to be processed. The function used to retrieve the text data is shown below.

The key Python packages needed for this function are provided by the NLTK library: **stopwords**, **word\_tokenize**, and **WordNetLemmatizer:**

    # define a function to further process the reviews text in english
    def process(text):
      #tokenize the text
      tokens = word_tokenize(text)
      # convert to lower case
      tokens = [w.lower() for w in tokens]
      # remove punctuation from each word
      table = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
      stripped = [w.translate(table) for w in tokens]
      # remove remaining tokens that are not alphabetic
      words = [word for word in stripped if word.isalpha()]
      # filter out stop words
      stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
      words = [w for w in words if not w in stop_words]
      #apply lemmatization 
      words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in words]
      text = "" "".join(words)
      return text
     
    # then we get a function that can be applied to the text column.

After processing the text column, the first five rows of the data used for the logistic regression model look like this:

       english                                          positive
    0    game top thumbsup thumbsup clappinghands clapp...    1
    1    indonesian facewithrollingeyes    0
    2    love find hidden object game like word must co...    1
    3    nt italian    1
    4    problem change language mother since english u...    1

Let's now move onto the steps of fitting a logistic model to the data.

The data frame is split into train and test sets. 80% of the data will be used for training, and 20% will be used for testing. Alternatively, the train\_test\_split method can be used to split the data, but here let's try another way:

    # random split train and test data to 80% and 20%
    index = df.index
    df['random_number'] = np.random.randn(len(index))
    train = df[df['random_number'] <= 0.8]
    test = df[df['random_number'] > 0.8]

To perform logistic regression analysis on text data, the text first needs to be tokenized and vectorized using a tool from the Scikit-learn library, **CounterVectorizer**.

    # count vectorizer:
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer(token_pattern=r'\b\w+\b')
    train_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(train['english'])
    test_matrix = vectorizer.transform(test['english'])
    
    # create an instance of the class LogisticRegression 
    lr = LogisticRegression()
    # split target and independant variables 
    X_train = train_matrix
    X_test = test_matrix
    y_train = train['positive']
    y_test = test['positive']

Two hyperparameters are fine tuned in the model: penalty and C values. GridSearchCV is used to find the optimal values for them.

    # Let's find out with what hyperparameter give the best model results.
    penalty = ['l1', 'l2', 'elasticnet', 'none']
    c_values = [100, 10, 1.0, 0.1, 0.01]
    grid = dict(penalty=penalty,C=c_values)
    cv = RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=10, n_repeats=3, random_state=1)
    grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=lr, param_grid=grid, n_jobs=-1, cv=cv, scoring='accuracy',error_score=0)
    grid_result = grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

&#x200B;

    # print the best hyperparameter values
    print(""Best: %f using %s"" % (grid_result.best_score_, grid_result.best_params_))
     
    Best: 0.726493 using {'C': 0.1, 'penalty': 'l2'}

It looks like at the default level C=0.1, penalty at 'l2', the best results are achieved. Those will be used as hyperparameters.

    # fit the model on data
    lr = LogisticRegression(C=0.1, penalty='l2', random_state=0)
    final_model = lr.fit(X_train,y_train)
     
    # make predictions
    predictions = final_model.predict(X_test)

The result is a successfully built and trained simple logistic regression model. Checking the accuracy score for both training and test data shows that the model has an overall 78% prediction accuracy on the training data, and 73% accuracy on the testing data. Or model is slightly overfitted.

## Discriminating words for positive and negative reviews

Using the logistic regression model, words or patterns that feature in the positive or negative reviews can be revealed. Let's look at the 10 most discriminating words for both types of reviews. This is done by looking at the largest and smallest coefficients, respectively.

    print(""Top 10 discriminating words for positive reviews:"")
     
    feature_to_coef = {
        word: coef for word, coef in zip(
            vectorizer.get_feature_names(), final_model.coef_[0]
        )
    }
    for best_positive in sorted(
        feature_to_coef.items(), 
        key=lambda x: x[1], 
        reverse=True)[:10]:
        print(best_positive)
     
    print (""\nTop 10 discriminating words for negative reviews:"")    
     
    best_negative_list = []
    for best_negative in sorted(
        feature_to_coef.items(), 
        key=lambda x: x[1])[:10]:
        best_negative_list.append(best_negative)
        print (best_negative)

&#x200B;

    Top 10 discriminating words for positive reviews:
    ('excellent', 1.2318797837182207)
    ('perfect', 1.0922819266631894)
    ('cool', 1.0645717900879892)
    ('nice', 1.004451706604957)
    ('great', 0.9375519484038363)
    ('fun', 0.9196472963620572)
    ('hope', 0.890851739223927)
    ('best', 0.7966138811023504)
    ('super', 0.775542710090151)
    ('wonderful', 0.7670213758020292)
     
    Top 10 discriminating words for negative reviews:
    ('rubbish', -0.8713436190047102)
    ('uninstall', -0.8652553696990095)
    ('terrible', -0.8452426468565963)
    ('uninstalled', -0.8315787570336696)
    ('refund', -0.7895618598247778)
    ('shit', -0.7562280034676745)
    ('junk', -0.7239565503012998)
    ('poor', -0.7209821924340266)
    ('garbage', -0.6243783857945131)
    ('delete', -0.6128080797008089)

The 10 most discriminating negative words have been saved for when we examine the negative reviews.

## Examine the negative reviews

The most important piece of information that the company wants to know is the reasons behind the negative reviews (involving localization). Therefore, all the negative localization review text data has been translated into English for closer examination. The key method used for this purpose is word concordances, a combination of keywords and discriminating negative words from the logistic regression model.

The negative review text column has been processed in the same way as the logistic model. A column has also been added to show the number of words in the reviews.

Using this data, it is possible to look at the distribution of review length, the top languages in which those negative reviews were written, as well as which games they refer to, before moving on to the negative review characteristics.

## Distribution of length of reviews

There are a total of 31,631 negative reviews about localization in the dataset. Below are two histograms showing the distribution of length in the number of words. The first shows the total number, and the second is with the outliers removed.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6w6139wslk871.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=02f9b62b579db3c91e8cf02a246ad7dc1fa5d1cd

From the above histogram, we can determine that most negative reviews are under 50 words in length. We will use this information to filter the reviews when examining their patterns using the method of word concordances.

## Top languages and games for negative reviews

Will the top 10 languages for negative reviews differ from those for all reviews? Let's take a look.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wsnsmucvlk871.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8affd238b760cddbbf3b32b667d08d855dcebb4

As the graph above demonstrates, the top 10 languages dominating the negative reviews are **Simplified Chinese, Russian, Korean, Turkish, English, Italian, Spanish, French, Japanese,** and **German**. The difference between this and the previous ranking for all reviews is the German language.

Next, let's see what 10 games have the most negative reviews about localization.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rnm8ttcxlk871.png?width=507&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e1c9da75cd1d9333c1f726c4e85b5a67f890bcb

The above shows the 10 games that have the most negative reviews that mention localization.

Although not all these reviews are negative exactly because of their localization quality - the filtering of localization reviews wasn't perfect - this data is still useful for localization companies to conduct further investigations into those games.

## Examining the negative reviews using word concordances

To examine the text reviews using word concordances, we need to first create a corpus for the review text, instantiate an NLTK text object using the corpus, and then call the concordance method. Below shows a code example carrying this procedure.

    # First, define a function to get corpus out of a text column
    def corpus(column):
      words_list = []
      for text in column:
        try:
          words = word_tokenize(text)
          words_list += words
        except:
          words = word_tokenize(str(text))
          words_list += words
      return words_list

&#x200B;

    # build the corpus and create an NLTK text object
    from nltk.corpus import stopwords
    corpus = corpus(df['english'].str.lower())
    text = nltk.Text(corpus)
     
    # find the first 20 lines of matches that have 'language'
    text.concordance(""language"", lines=20)

Using this method, concordances for the following words have been generated:

* language
* translation
* localization/localization
* problem
* difficult
* rubbish
* terrible
* \[censored\]
* grammar

These are a mixture of the localization key words, what we observed from the wordclouds, as well as the discriminating negative words generated from the logistic regression model. The list can certainly expand depending on the information being sought.

For each concordance, we have generated 20 matching lines for further examination. Below is an example of such concordances matching the word 'language'.

    Displaying 20 of 11812 matches:

Examination of the concordances for all the selected keywords shows that, although in most reviews related to localization there is the mention of the lack of the users' native language in the games, an additional urgency can be detected.

Чтобы изменить содержимое ячейки, дважды нажмите на нее (или выберите ""Ввод"")

These can be shown in, for example:

* ""When is Polish language???????"" with many questions marks to emphasize
* the '!"" after ""there is no Russian language!""
* please add/put language of ...
* ""Turkish support should be added immediately""
* ""don't your hurry up and fix it""

The analysis also reveals the difficulty users experience when playing games without local language support, for example:

* ""without Vietamaese it is too difficult to play""
* ""difficult to understand because it is not in...""
* ""difficult to understand instructions""
* ""the method of Japanese mod is difficult""
* ""Thai language... difficult ... to be able to play""

Users also noted the issue with localization quality, for example:

* ""translation is rubbish""
* 'terrible translation""
* ""The Chinese localization is rubbish, even worse than google translation""
* 'weird grammar""
* ""can not play because of missing grammar""

and potential cultural conflict, for example

* ""discriminate against Chinese""

Furthermore, given the concern that not all reviews that mention localization are negative because of a specific localization problem, it is important to find out what negative comments are being made about localization. Therefore, the following function might be useful:

    # define a simple function to calculate how many rows in the review column contains particular word or expression
    def cal_keyword(keyword, column):
      count = 0
      for value in column: 
        if value.find(keyword) != -1:
          count +=1
      return count 

The function can of course be applied to find the frequency of any expressions, such as 'language sucks', 'bad grammar', or 'poor translation', to make the search more specific. The function and its modifications will allow the analyst to quickly locate reviews of particular patterns and perform further analysis on them.

For example, applying the function using 'bad translation' reveals there are 48 matching records. A possible next step would be to find out which these are, what games, and what languages.

    # First let's check out those that contain language 
    cal_keyword('bad translation', df['english'])
     
    48

## Conclusion

The analysis discussed in this article reveals the most popular languages among the reviews, as well as which games received the most reviews mentioning localization. These would provide useful information for the localization company on what to focus in their strategic planning.

An investigation of the positive and negative reviews translated in English shows that they exhibit similar structures in language use, both noting the lack of games in a specific language and the difficulty that causes gamers to experience.

A notable difference in the positive reviews is that the lack of a local language version may not have impacted the enjoyment of the game. For negative reviews, having no local language version or a bad translation add to the barriers of game play, even arousing a feeling of discrimination in some cases, and so a hint of detected urgency and frustration.

To sum up, the top reasons for negative sentiments are :

* lack of specific language
* bad/poor/terrible translation
* difficult in understanding or playing in English
* repeated requests to add language not addressed
* discrimination/stereotypes
* bad/awkward localization
* wrong, bad, or weird grammar and punctuation use

The tools and functions described in this article allow the company to quickly distinguish what languages and games they should pay particular attention to in their localization plans. An easy to apply method has also been provided, which allows the company to examine the reasons for negative reviews. Using the procedure demonstrated, it is also possible for the localization company to further examine which languages and games the problems persist in, such as poor translation or even stereotypes, and take action accordingly.",30,2,xiacui,2021-07-01 09:35:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/obi8be/video_game_localization_how_to_find_out_user/,0,dataanalysis

My current project is 4 multi tabbed dashboards with a 2 month delivery period. They have very neat requirements which is a godsend but within those requirements there's 4-5 filters on each dashboard and I'm not sure if it's better practice to filter it within the model or external.

15e5ykz,Received a new job offer. Not sure what to do.,"Looking for some input and for any advice. 

I work in the health tech field as a data analyst/BI dev at a fortune 100 company and have about 1.5 years experience. A lot of my day to day consists of writing sql queries to build backend logic for various long term initiatives we have, completing sql related ad hoc requests, and creating/maintaining/enhancing power bi dashboard for internal stakeholders.

Current Company: 

For the most part, i enjoy my job. I like my team and the work i do. My current compensation is ~$83,000, 401K with decent employer match, employer contribution to my HSA, unlimited PTO, 10% bonus to be payed out in december (will talk about this later). 

Back in march, my manager left for another company. We were pretty close and I was bummed about their leaving especially since i was still relatively early in my career and stint with the company. For the next few months, i was assigned a new manager and we tried to fill the knowledge gap that was left with my old manager leaving. It was rough but we managed and i like my new manager. We get along and they have a lot of technical experience that could help further my career. 

New Offer:

My old manager reached out to me a month ago and asked if i’d be interested in joining them at their new company. I would transition to a senior DA role and they would bump my pay up anywhere from 15-20% higher than it is now. From what i’ve seen the 401k and health/vision/dental are all slightly better. Not sure about pto. Have a meeting with their HR soon to get more questions answered more 

The job itself seems a bit more up my alley. I would work more on shorter term adhoc projects rather than long term ones. There would also be a larger variety in the types of projects given the fact that the new company is medium size health care consultancy firm. The data team at the new company is smaller so there will be some growing pains but it seems their mission for the future, growing the team, and implementing best practices is solid. 

I believe the new company can also help develop my skills and set myself up for the future well given the previous/current experience of everyone on the new team.

My concerns:

1. General guilt leaving my current company. Especially when there isnt anything they’ve done wrong. The only issue is that i’d like shorter term projects than the longer term projects i currently do.

2. If i decline the offer from my old manager, especially after 3 rounds of interviews, that would reflect poorly on him. 

3. If i leave my current company, i would forfeit my bonus due at the end of the month (i think). I have asked if the new company can offset this by offering a sign on bonus. They said they’d get back to me.

4. Leaving a company after 1.5 years. How does that look on a resume? 

5. Growing pains of a new/young data team. 

6. Leaving a fortune 100 company when i’m not unhappy. 

7. Anything else i need to be concerned about/ask during HR meeting?

Thank you for any advice!


Edit:

They reached out with a final offer! 

New Job: 

- Comes with title bump
- Salary: $97000
- Sign on: $2000
- Health Insurance: HDHP with HSA. $0 out of each paycheck. $62.5 employer contribution per pay check.
- Vision/Dental: $0 out of each paycheck
- PTO: 23 days. 15.33 accrued at the start of each month. Can carry over for a total of up to 34 days. No separate bank for sick days.
- 401k match: For every 1% i match, up to 6%, employer matches .25% + profit sharing match of 3% of salary. .25% match has 6 year graded vesting but 3% profit sharing match is immediately vested.
- Smaller company
- Company stock: eligible in 2025 (need to be with company for 1 full year. 
-Potential Start date: Mid October.

Only lingering concern is the lack of separate sick days and leaving almost 9K on the table (8k bonus + 3k unvested 401k - 2k sign on). Regardless new position is better in salary, bonus opps, title, and benefits. Going to move forward with the offer and the new company!

s1xts1,I Got Offered A Job But…,"Hello everyone, I like to give my background and experience. I am a mathematics teacher. At the beginning of this year I knew I was going to leave the teaching profession. I dived into data analytics work and started training myself in SQL, Python, and visualization tools like PowerBi. 
I applied to over 100 jobs and nothing. I finally made a portfolio/changed my resume and then interviews are pouring in. 

I just got offered a job. Seems like a nice place but health insurance is not great. The offer was 75k. I have to relocate for this position which means selling my home and buying another. My monthly expenses would increase but overall I will get a small bump in my monthly budget compared to teaching. This place told me I have 24 hours to accept the job. 
Here’s the issue. I have 5 other places interviewing me. One is local 3 are remote. I don’t want to be ungrateful for the offer but it’s hard to wonder what the others will say. My recruiter tells me I have a good chance at one of  the places. 
What makes this decision hard is wanting to leave education with the current dynamic. My wife is pregnant so health insurance is important. I thought about counter offering the current offer for a slightly higher salary to overcome health cost or ask them to contribute to HSA. 

Should I accept the first offer and be excited I got offered a decent wage for being so green? It’s hard to know what to choose when I’m new to this tech field.


UPDATE: 
First I like to thank everyone and your support. It’s been a busy week. I accepted the job. To help buy some time I sent a counter offer and decided to wait and see what would happen. In addition they are giving me every vacation time for when the baby is born. Sadly it was better than my benefits as a teacher. 
So I am moving, but they are allowing me to work remotely for up to 90 days while I work on my transition. They even upped my hire date so I can receive benefits soon.

17is5p8,Advice for Aspiring Analysts: Ask Me Anything,"Hi.

I'm a manager of a mid-size data analytics and reporting team at a large insurance corporation. My team is the primary entry point for new analysts in our division of the company; new analysts coming in are expected to spend a year or so learning the basics on my team, and then get put into consideration for either promotion out to more specialized teams, or promotion up into a more committed role in the team I manage. 

So, I spend a lot of time hiring, managing, and training new analysts. I'm pretty good at it, or at least I like to think so, and it's one of the favorite parts of my job. I also used to be a new analyst, many moons ago; I worked my way up step by step, with a combination of skill and luck, to my current role. 

Are you someone looking to break into the data industry? Are you an experienced analyst, looking for that next step up the career ladder? Ask me anything!

My take on a few common questions:

**How do I get a job in analytics?** \- I strongly recommend applying to as many internships as possible. Having a foot in the door at a corporation gives you so much of an advantage it really isn't funny, and even if it doesn't work out at the company you interned with, having corporate work experience under your belt is a massive advantage when it comes to interviewing. Stuff like certification programs and so on are less important... unless you're pursuing analytics as a second career, at which point anything you can do to signal that you're actually interested in data and not just a cushy job is valuable.

**What sort of qualifications do you look for in a candidate?** \- For an entry-level position, I'm willing to interview just about anybody with a bachelor's degree in something vaguely STEM-adjacent and proficiency with a programming language of some sort. With that said, I'm much more confident than the average manager in my teaching skills, so I'm able to be a bit more flexible and cast a wider net. (That's paid off; some of my best employees have come from sales backgrounds, from the telecom industry, from call centers, and so on.) 

More than 90% of my team's work is done with SQL, so as you'd expect, a candidate knowing SQL is a plus, but it's not as strong of an advantage as you'd expect. SQL is an easy language to learn but a difficult skill to master; school projects just don't prepare candidates for the complexities of working in a live database with more than 500 rows of actual data. Query optimization, searching for the columns you need, troubleshooting bugs, and so on, are all things that you rarely learn without working in a corporate environment. (Another reason why internships are incredibly useful for building resumes.) Personally, I would strongly prefer a candidate who worked on a great Python project in school and can talk passionately about it and the challenges they overcame in completing it but no SQL experience to a candidate that had SQL experience, but only in a scholastic context. 

Which brings me to my next point, which is that it's important to interview well. Data analytics may be a very technically focused career, but soft skills like the ability to communicate clearly and give presentations are valuable in any professional context. Personally, the number one thing I'm looking for in a candidate is someone who can convince me that they're a fast learner and a problem solver. (Telling me 'I'm a fast learner' or 'I'm a problem solver' in the interview doesn't cut it - have examples, and be ready to talk about them.) Qualifications mostly matter to me as a way to rule out candidates who don't have them as obviously unfit - someone who can tell me stories about their work experience or school experience or their hobbies that also show me why they're a valuable candidate are the people I love to hire. 

**I'm already an analyst. How do I get promoted to a leadership role?** \- First, make sure you want to be a leader. There are a lot of people out there who get promoted to management positions because they're so senior that they have no other means for career advancement, and the skills that make someone a good manager are very different from the skills that made them a good analyst. If you really love getting your hands dirty with data and would hate having to delegate the fun parts of your job to someone else, if you're uncomfortable in social situations that might require having hard conversations with people, if you hate meetings and documentation and making timelines... I don't recommend trying to push for a promotion to manager. 

With that said, if you're ambitious and hard-working and looking to climb the corporate ladder, there are a few things I can recommend. 

First, take every opportunity possible to teach. Is there a new hire in the department? Volunteer to show them the ropes. Take time out of your day to help them fix bugs. Failing that, do you have a customer or user that's having trouble with something? Show them how to get data without having to rely on you. Give them a canned SQL statement they can run to generate a report. This will do a few things. It will give you a general reputation for helpfulness, which is never a bad thing. It will prepare you for when you have people reporting to you, and you need to teach them. And other leaders in your organization will notice.

Second, show initiative. Find something you can do that your manager didn't ask for but they'd like to have done anyways. Documentation is a safe bet; people who like documenting procedures are rare, and odds are good that whatever resources your team has are probably poorly maintained and outdated. Again, if you have new hires in the department, being able to hand them a packet explaining everything they need to get productive faster, and having that packet be something that you wrote, is a double-whammy on the 'showing leadership' charts. On the other hand, if your manager is a documenter (or you really just aren't), find a process that irritates you and everyone else, and apply automation to it until it's no longer an annoyance. Or take a report that's currently delivered in Excel and find a way to get it working in PowerBI or Tableau. Being able to identify problems and solve them proactively is something indispensable for leaders.

Third, find ways to organize and present things. Does your department have a monthly lunch for analysts to socialize? Is there interest in bringing leaders from other departments to present on how other parts of the company work? Does your company have a committee that works on event planning for team building activities? Don't sign up for so many useless meetings that your work output suffers, but if you can start making your voice be heard in even meaningless contexts, it's the first step towards people asking for your voice in more meaningful contexts.

Fourth, do good work. Do it consistently. Go the extra mile in fixing things right away when they inevitably go wrong. Your reputation is a weapon. 

Fifth, make connections. If your department is delivering results to a leader from another department, point out something interesting you noticed about those results, or ask them if those results mean X or Y. Chat with people at the water cooler, if you are still working in an office rather than remote. Ask people what it is they're working on, and listen to them. Maybe you'll have a way to solve their problem. Maybe if you tell them that, they'll promote you and put you in charge of doing it.

It happened to me.

117jae6,How are you integrating Tableau with SQL?,"I've been taking a deep dive into strengthening my Tableau skills lately to combine with and practice my SQL skills, but it seems like some of the more complex things in Tableau require you to do calculations in that rather than in SQL. For example, I want to create a dashboard of KPIs using the Tableau Superstore dataset (similar to [this](https://workout-wednesday.com/2022w31tab/) dashboard), but I want to use SQL to make my calculations before moving over to Tableau. So let's say I want to find the sum of sales, profit, and orders per month per year. I also went ahead and calculated the percent change in sales, profit, and orders (just in case I wanted to use them for something). That query is below:

    -- separate month and year to group orders by month
    With date as (
    Select DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%m') as month, DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y') as year,
    		sales, profit, order_id
    From orders
    ),
    
    -- sum sales and profit
    sums as (
    Select month, year, ROUND(SUM(sales), 2) as sales, ROUND(SUM(profit), 2) as profit, 
    		COUNT(distinct order_id) as sum_orders
    From date
    Group by month, year
    Order by month ASC, year ASC
    )
    
    -- month over month sales, profit, and orders
    Select month, year, sales, 
    		ROUND((sales - LAG(sales) OVER(order by year, month)) / 
    			lag(sales) OVER(order by year, month) * 100, 2) as percent_change_in_sales,
    		profit,
    		ROUND((profit - LAG(profit) OVER(order by year, month)) / 
    			lag(profit) OVER(order by year, month) * 100, 2) as percent_change_in_profit,
    		sum_orders,
            ROUND((sum_orders - LAG(sum_orders) OVER(order by year, month)) / 
    			lag(sum_orders) OVER(order by year, month) * 100, 2) as percent_change_in_orders
    From sums
    Group by month, year
    Order by year, month

But now if I wanted to display a breakdown of the sub-categories sold as shown in the example dashboard, I wouldn't be able to do any of this because including the sub-categories in my query would break everything up by sub_category. Is that just the necessary evil of having to work with Tableau and to be able to get everything out of Tableau? Should I be more ""general"" with my query and allow Tableau to calculate sums and other things?

The Tableau ""experts"" I have seen don't even use SQL by the looks of it instead opting to use Tableau's language. Do I *need* to learn Tableau's language in order to use it, or is SQL good enough?",28,7,Exquisite_Poupon,2023-02-20 20:16:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/117jae6/how_are_you_integrating_tableau_with_sql/,0,dataanalysis

One thing that I would like to say (again as someone who is about to embark on the journey towards becoming a data analyst) is to JUST GO FOR IT.

The only thing that will FOR SURE stop you from working in data is sitting back and not pursuing it. 

No two people have the same circumstances or opportunities. 

Some people send out 50 resumes, some people (at least on here) send out 100’s of resumes. But you know who doesn’t get to send out even one? The person that didn’t try to get their foot in the door.


I hope this encourages someone to stop waiting for a magic ball to tell them whether or not they’d be able to get the dream career they are searching for - or waiting and looking for someone else who has done the exact same thing and is super duper successful because the reality is you’ll for sure get some sort of opportunity if you can prove yourself.


You’ve got this. Even if it’ll be harder than the traditional path. Just keep learning and pursuing.

mzaztv,"Seasonality in Bitcoin Hashrate and Average Rainfall in Sichuan, China"," Originally, this project was going to test correlation between bitcoin's price and it's hashrate. As I dug into it, it seemed more and more like a useless enterprise and I kind of lost interest. However, in gathering the data, I read about a large drop-off (45%) in hashrate earlier this month (4/15/21). Looking into it further, most sources attributed this drop to blackouts in Xinjiang, China where a lot of mining operations are conducted (see Bitcoin mining map of China below). It was a strong indication of China's dominance in the Bitcoin mining, and further Googling found that sources attribute 60% of the global hashrate to China. This led me down another rabbit hole - geographic distribution (or rather concentration) of bitcoin mining in China, and got me wondering about the potential effects this might have on the total hashrate. 

A few articles I read touched on yearly miner migrations within China - moving seasonally to areas where the rates of electricity are under-utilized and over-supplied. One of the biggest, if not the biggest driver of these migrations is hydro-electricity during the rainy season (Jun-Sep), mainly in the Sichuan and Northern Yunnan provinces. Dams like Xiluodu (3rd largest power station in the world) produce tons of cheap electricity for the region. What seems to happen is that many mining farms relocate to these areas during the rainy season, and transition back to areas with thermal power facilities (coal) like Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang in the dry season. Rates for electricity during the wet season can be twice as cheap as those in thermal power. 

[Bitcoin Mining Map - Univ. of Cambridge](https://preview.redd.it/4hugunmuplv61.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=2901550bd27e2a4d453c847fcb236a4ff4e6f2ea)

I decided to test some of these numbers for myself - just to see if there was a recognizable pattern. For all you traders out there, I would have loved to have tied this to price action but the geeky side of me got a little carried away and this is mostly an academic endeavor. But hey, if you see some profitable insight here share the love and let a brother know! I plot hashrate vs. price at the end of this article if you are interested.

Here is a de-trended (more on that in a bit) box-and-whisker plot of average monthly hashrate for the last 3 years:

[Hashrate Trends 2018-2020](https://preview.redd.it/molpnqvxplv61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=a454c441cb4c0ae0c9409cdbda582b57bbad6038)

You can see a yearly increase in hashrate starting around May/June and dropping off again around October, coinciding with average rainfall in Sichuan:

[Average Rainfall in Sichuan \(Chengdu\)](https://preview.redd.it/cr5adj20qlv61.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4a7e7ab6131dae894277fb2e94288997443757a)

In order to get this data and visualize any cyclical patterns, I had to correct for a large uptrend - a meteoric rise in hashrate over the last 5-6 years due to the recent popularity of crypto, the scaling of commercial mining operations, and better hardware i.e. higher hashrate, better energy efficiency (see hashrate graph below). If this correction wasn't made, all we'd see is a large increase in hashrate - and you wouldn't need this article to tell you that.

I started by running a series decomposition using Python's statsmodel library. It's used as a general indicator for trends/seasonality by calculating a trend line and seasonal patterns, but should be used as a weak indicator and taken with a grain of salt. I used to it make sure I was headed in the right general direction and to reference later. Since I was looking for a seasonal trend I aggregated average hashrate per month to see what, if any, seasonal patterns were present. Plotting out this decomposition gives you the following:

[Each ghetto snipping tool markup indicates a year](https://preview.redd.it/umwh31j2qlv61.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f0f74266f0e9d52de86ec5218bb845a6f3ea500)

With this weak confirmation of seasonality present, I took it further by deconstructing my own means of trend correction with the intent to plot each year's monthly distribution of daily hashrate and see if the different years resembled each other. I used the NumPy .polyfit() module to do a polynomial regression on average daily hashrates from 2015-2021 (to represent the ""trend""), and then used the difference between the actual hashrate (observed) and the trendline (prediction) to create another dataset. What you see in the boxplots above are the distributions of these differences by month and year. 

**In plain English, I was asking ""how much over or under was the actual observed hashrate compared to the hashrate predicted by the general uptrend?""**. The boxplots show that in the rainy months, the actual hashrate generally sits above the trend.

Here is the actual hashrates, in green, plotted against the trendline, in blue:

[Observed vs. Predicted Average Daily Hashrate](https://preview.redd.it/w4m1kgj5qlv61.png?width=1397&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a8b4166de9d9042240536b902785fa3d673e338)

Teasing out seasonality any earlier than 2017 was difficult to do as the average hashrates are comparatively so much smaller early years than in later years, that the regression line being used to represent the ""trend"" is a lot less representative in those earlier years. You can see in the plot above, that prior to 2017/2018 the trend line doesn't fit the data as well in a relative sense ('relative' being the key word here).

If I scrunch the timeline and the regression down to 3 years and run the regression then, it follows the trend a bit better but still doesn't give us anything too significant in terms of seasonality. You can see them below. A little better, but I think still skewed by external macro trends. Keep in mind that bitcoin mining is still in relative infancy - the ASIC was introduced 2013 and 2014-2016 marked the rise of China's dominance in mining with pools like Bitmain and Antpool. 

I imagine it takes a bit of time to learn and refine your operations so that large consolidated efforts like mining farm migration might not have been as prevalent in those earlier years. The data may also have been skewed by early regulatory disruptions like China shutting down exchanges in 2017.

[2017](https://preview.redd.it/837rpgm9qlv61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=9249a737b28dec167589ffeb959c2529e8e30dbc)

[2015](https://preview.redd.it/f033pflcqlv61.png?width=867&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a3fccde0c71208d3c075c1e85b6f49df28a0c32)

**In conclusion (yay!)**, we can see that there is a disproportionate concentration of mining operations in China mainly due to an abundance of low-cost energy (sometimes subsidized), and in my humble opinion - a larger supply of low-cost, tech-savvy labor willing to live in the middle of butt-fuck nowhere to maintain mining farms (Read: Lower Quality-of-Life). I know the crypto-world loathes the word ""centralization"" - generally following libertarian principles of self-sovereignty and free-market yadda-yadda-beep-boop. So on the surface this concentration seems like a bad or maybe even a dangerous thing, but the reality is that these miners account for a large portion of bitcoin's network security - and if they fucked around and the price of bitcoin tanked, they'd be hurting just as much as the next guy. It's in their interest to maintain network health and ensure enough liquidity for them to cash-in their efforts. So I think there's some general incentive-alignment there to put your mind at ease.

Like it or not, bitcoin mining in China is important to the crypto ecosystem as a whole, in the same way AWS is important to the internet ecosystem. For that reason, I think it's wise to continue to pay close attention to the dynamics of mining in China. For example, due recent efforts to meet climate change targets and push the carbon-neutral narrative, China is reportedly shutting down crypto-mining operations in Inner Mongolia, along with other energy-intensive industries.

How does this affect the distribution and competitiveness of China's bitcoin mining? What does it speak to more general questions - e.g. as Bitcoin's network value grows, how will we maintain the economic value of POW network security when it is directly tied to energy consumption - and can energy consumption scale in the same fashion? Currently the energy consumption of Bitcoin is comparable the total energy consumption of Kazakhstan, with a carbon footprint comparable to that of the country of Hungary. And that's *just Bitcoin*. If the price and hashrate trend continues, we're likely looking at more. So as we ask these questions, we should continue to keep a close eye on China's energy policy stances and the general landscape of bitcoin miners and their migrations in the region.

   
 

**For the traders, as promised. Price in green:**

ieuluu,What I Wish I Knew Before Picking Up Data Analytics Tools/Skills," 

Technical skills are important. Python, Tableau, SQL, etc...With so many free resources, the number of learning options can be overwhelming. Worse yet, I think there can be a lot of uncertainty going from learning to nabbing a job in analytics.

As I've considered my own career, I remember struggling a lot with what to do as I was learning tools like Tableau or programming languages like Python. For me, the big goal was always a job. Early on, I didn't feel like I had enough to offer a company. But I overcame that lack of experience and landed an analytics job with zero years of experience. Here are a few recommendations based on what I did:

* Solve real world problems outside of your learning context. So many courses and tutorials are meant to make you feel accomplished. But the way you'll continue to learn is by solving real world problems outside of your learning environment.
* Talk the talk. Okay, you need to be able to follow your talk with results. But a lot of getting a job involves being able to talk about your skills in a format the company is looking for. Otherwise, they won't recognize you possess the skills they're looking for
* Get creative by showcasing your projects. Even if your projects were apart of a tutorial, showcase it. I saw a great way of doing this on a LinkedIn profile the other day. He was enrolled in a coding boot camp, but listed his projects as separate experiences on LinkedIn. Some recruiters will be rigid with only reaching out to people with full-time work experience, but some recruiters just want someone with the skills their company is looking for.

What are your thoughts? Agree/Disagree?",28,12,chaeboi,2020-08-23 01:26:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/ieuluu/what_i_wish_i_knew_before_picking_up_data/,0,dataanalysis

1bd0vv8,any suggestions to help an experienced data analyst find a job?,"Hello all you wonderful Redditors, thanks for any advice (or commiseration). I was swept up in my previous employer's reduction in force Sep 2022. I've been unemployed since then (aside from making $40K in consulting fees). Who has managed to get a new job in the last 365 days... and how???  For those unemployed the past year, how are you getting by?

&#x200B;

I have 20+ years of Business Intelligence / Marketing Data Analyst experience, with a large focus on segmentation and investment optimization at financial institutions.  I actually have converted big data into transformational business insights IRL. A prior company made over $100 million after following my optimization suggestions. I also have a U.S. patent in my name for Data Arbitration. With my qualifications, I thought getting a job would be hard, but not impossible.  My challenges are: I probably have to be remote (my home town lacks financial institutions); and for programming, I really only know SAS and SQL.  (Yeah, I know. SAS is long gone.) I've done some university Python and ML courses, while unemployed.

&#x200B;

I've sourced almost all jobs on LinkedIn, applied on the company's website, and followed up with a message to a company HR rep, extolling specifically how my skills fit a primary job requirement. I've applied to around 100 appropriate remote jobs since then, made it to the final round at 5 companies - and received 0 offers. Almost uniformly, I've received very positive feedback from the hiring managers. Four of these companies extended offers to internal candidates.  I have applied to some non-remote in town... there are just few roles here even in person.

184qwdu,for those of you looking for a clear roadmap + job hunt strategy for today's data analytics market,"hey everyone! another free workshop this fri for those of you interested in becoming data analysts. awesome to see 200 of you join last time…we’re growing!

this session will be Friday, December 1st at 11am est - i’ll talk about my mentorship program and the strategy behind job hunt success in today’s competitive market for early-career data analysts. it’s the same **strategy that landed 5 students from my first cohort their first roles in analytics, without previous data experience, now earning $75K-$180K USD - all within 8 weeks of the program ending.**

the job hunt does not need to be horribly opaque if you have the right roadmap to make your time and energy worth it. the program i built is founded on 3 key pillars:

1. creating a standout resume using the MINDS framework I demo’ed in the last session
2. gaining realistic, hands-on experience through high-quality projects that use the real data ecosystem, business metrics, and questions companies care about
3. a framework for nailing technical interviews and narrating previous work experience in a way that resonates with data managers

my goal is to help aspiring analysts who are feeling overwhelmed or unsure of how to become a data analyst gain standout technical / interview / business skills and confidence in their application - so that they can start fulfilling careers in data and gain professional leverage, financial stability, and work flexibility. now as a director in data and former bootcamp instructor whos hired and trained many analysts, i'm super grateful to have found all of these myself, and aim to use my experience to make it possible to others.

191jqrv,"Re: ""Data Roomba"" to get clean-up tasks done faster","A couple months ago, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/17vu9e7/data_roomba_to_get_cleanup_tasks_done_faster/) about a ""Data Roomba"" I built to save analysts' time on data janitor assignments. I got solid feedback from y'all, and today I'm pushing a big round of improvements that came out of these conversations.

As a reminder, here's the basic idea behind [Computron](https://squack.io/?utm_content=dataanalysis&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=v0p4_website):

* Upload a messy spreadsheet.
* Write commands for how to transform the data.
* Computron builds and executes Python code to follow the command.
* Save the code as an automation and reuse it on other similar files.

A lot of people said this type of data clean-up goes hand-in-hand with EDA -- it helps to know properties of the data to decide on the next transformation. *e.g.* If you're reconciling a bank ledger you might want to check whether the transactions in a particular column tie with a monthly balance.

I implemented this by adding a classification layer that lets you ask Computron to perform QUERIES and TRANSFORMATIONS in one single chat interface. Here's how it works:

* Ask an exploratory question or describe your a transformation.
* Computron classifies and displays the request as a QUERY or TRANSFORMATION.
* Computron writes and executes code to return the result of the QUERY or to carry out the TRANSFORMATION.

Keep in mind that a QUERY doesn't transform the underlying data, and thus it won't be included in code that gets compiled when you save an automation. Also, right now I'm still figuring out the best way to support plotting requests -- for now the results of a QUERY will just be saved into a csv. But that's coming soon!

I hope you all can benefit from this new feature! I also want to give a shoutout to r/datascience and r/dataanalysis in particular for all the support y'all have given me on this project -- none of this would have been possible without the keen insights from those of you who tried it.

17xmoqt,How can you gain more experience if you are completely ignored ? (Text-heavy),"A couple of months ago I joined this company with the promise of being part of a team full of professionals in the field which I was very excited about because they told me about some projects that involved moving away from Excel towards using datalakes, pipelines, devops and a lot of new technologies.

Coming from only using Excel, a bit of SQL and Power BI for analysis, I immediately accepted the job, as I was hoping to get more experience and in a couple of years jump into data engineering which is my main goal.

Only two weeks after joining the team, they stopped inviting me to the meetings where they talked about the big projects and the new technologies that would be adopted. I was told that I no longer belonged to the IT team (there is no data team as such) and that because the company would be acquired by a bigger one, there would be changes in the roles and structure.

Now I just spend my days making corrections to erroneous data in Excel, manually updating Power BI dashboards (which nobody uses by the way) when some errors arise. As I don't belong to any department I don't have clear instructions, I have asked directly to the VP and the IT manager but I don't get clear answers.

The place where I live does not have many companies where my position is needed and I have applied to remote positions but I am constantly being ghosted.

I feel stuck with no possibility to grow or learn anything . Everything is more expensive every day and the money I get is no longer enough.

Financially, it has been a huge issue since I got into med school 3 years ago. I have 3 more to go and have been thinking about taking up DA freelance jobs part-time to try and stabilize my financial life a bit. I'm at an intermediate level in SQL, Excel, R and Python. I already have a couple of platforms in mind as well and have been looking into what projects are most common, but I'm not sure if this actually has any chance of working, which is what motivated me into doing this post.

Has anyone done freelance part-time? Is it feasible and profitable? Is there any ""hidden"" workload to keep in mind? Anything you did when you first started that you'd do differently?

16fz3zl,Is this legit?,"This feels too good to be true. Also, it moved very quickly. Got emailed last week that my “interview” would be today. 

The interview consisted of them sending me an email with a large questionnaire that I had 90 minutes to complete. 

After completion they said it would be sent for immediate review and I will have a decision by two hours. 

Decision went through, they are offering exactly what I asked for. And it says they will send a check/deposit to pay for home office set up (the only red flag to me)

I’ve never worked from home, nor have I had a full time position in the data analytics field. 

Everything online shows this company is totally reputable but my fiance seems to think everything about it is fishy. Any ideas? If this is legit it would be perfect for me. I’ll attach images of the email.",25,43,jessemaner,2023-09-11 16:01:28,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/16fz3zl,0,dataanalysis
15evopk,Current Data Analyst looking for career advice,"About me: I have about 3 years of experience, a CS degree and currently work in utilities. I’m making $70k but just got a pay bump to $80k and feeling a bit undervalued and underpaid so I’m trying to figure out what I need to do next to advance my career. I’m in a HCOL area and was originally hired on as hybrid remote but I was recently told I need to be in the office every day so I’ve been applying to jobs.

Current role: I’m the only data analyst at my company which is a smaller but mid stage start up. I deal with a lot of different data and work directly with all of the departments gathering/delivering data and building reporting. Right now I mostly build reporting in Tableau and gather/deliver data using SQL/python for our financial department. But a few months back my main focus was building ETL and designing our new database (were totally revamping our data infrastructure and front end). I also work heavily with GIS data specifically using ArcGis pro and FME. I have also built reporting for our customer service, marketing and operations departments.  

Career advice request:
I feel like I’m spread pretty thin but I am learning a lot. I also feel like I should start focusing on one specialization. I really enjoy the financial work and I get a lot of good feedback from our finance team, specifically our CFO and director of Finance who I work closely with. But I’m not sure what kind of role I would work in where I can still use python/sql and tableau if im strictly working in Finance. I don’t have a background in Finance so financial analyst doesn’t seem like the right job to apply for. Im also pretty good with GIS data now which is a great skillset when working in utilities and oil and gas, and I have experience in both industries.

Basically I’m wondering if being in this broad data analyst position is the best thing for my career or should I be focusing on finance or GIS and really specializing in one? I started applying for jobs and feel like I might not be getting them because I’m not great at one thing but good at a lot of things. When applying for jobs should I be looking for similar roles where I’d be doing more broad analytics or is it better to be in a specialized position. I’m really looking to grow and to make as much money as possible in the long run. I also may have the opportunity to join the finance team at my current company but I’m not sure if my pay/title would change. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",26,8,Stonedsurfer,2023-07-31 23:31:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/15evopk/current_data_analyst_looking_for_career_advice/,0,dataanalysis

I am currently working on my first dashboarding project, which I have began the process of cleaning the imported data.

I have a dataset which contains a list of athletes and events they have competed in and whether they have achieved anything from this (along with other additional columns). Unfortunately, some of the athletes ages are missing. The data goes back more than 100 years ago, where I tend to find the missing ages of these athletes.

I don't want to exclude the athletes with the missing ages entirely as it will affect the overall analysis. I was thinking of manually adding their ages in but their are two problems with this approach. The first is that when searching their names, some don't appear in Google. The second issue is their are too many missing entries to perform this process manually.

How would you deal with this issue? Thanks.",25,21,Playful-Drink7784,2023-05-19 12:20:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/13ltvu1/data_cleaning_help_dealing_with_missing_entries/,0,dataanalysis

120grya,Magic: The Gathering dashboard | Feedback welcome,"Hi everyone,

I am fairly new, learning Python since December 2022, and coming from a non-tech background. I took part in the [DataTalksClub Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp). I started using these tools used in the project in January 2023.

Project link: [GitHub repo for Magic: The Gathering](https://github.com/VincenzoGalante/magic-the-gathering)

Project background:

* I used to play Magic: The Gathering a lot back in the 90s
* I wanted to understand the game from a meta perspective and tried to answer questions that I was interested in

Technologies used:

* Infrastructure via terraform, and GCP as cloud
* I read the [scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/) for card data
* Push them to my storage bucket
* Push needed data points to BigQuery
* Transform the data there with DBT
* Visualize the final dataset with [Looker](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/ebdf68e1-27f7-435b-8add-a4018681f801)

I am somewhat proud to having finished this, as I never would have thought to learn all this. I did put a lot of long evenings, early mornings and weekends into this. In the future I plan to do more projects and apply for a Data Engineering or Analytics Engineering position - preferably at my current company.

Please feel free to leave constructive feedback on code, visualization or any other part of the project.

vxv1or,"What are ""problem-solving skills"" ?","In many fields (not just those that fall under Data Science) people talk about the need to have problem-solving skills. I can't recall coming across any explanation what this means, which makes it hard to help people develop these skills.

Off the top of my head, I would say that the following non-exhaustive list constitute problem-solving skills:

1. Being able to break a large problem down into smaller components, making each one easier to address
2. Tracing the root cause. Some professions call this root-cause analysis or ""the 5 whys"".
3. Figuring out how you will test if the problem is solved
4. Recognizing when you haven't broken down the problem enough to be able to test solutions effectively
5. Using the process of elimination
6. Developing thought experiments to explore ""what if"" - I find these handy by testing extremes to figure out the boundary of the issue e.g. what if X always happens? What if it never happens? What if the value was infinite, what if it was zero? What if it didn't exist at all?
7. Developing a mental model of the fundamentals drivers/philosophy of why you are trying to achieve the thing the problem is preventing. Sometimes you identify how to bypass the problem entirely
8. Recognising all the resources at your disposal to solve the issue, and searching for new ones if needed. This could be time, money, or more often than not, expertise of others. 

&#x200B;

What's your take on this? Have you come across any more formal thinking on what it is to have good problem-solving skills?

ucx5ms,Getting an Entry-Level Data Analytics Job With No Degree (Is It Possible?),"Hello everyone 👋

I've been doing a deep dive into the world of analytics to upskill myself as my career progresses to the demand of future jobs. It's been very fascinating, to say the least, how powerful these tools are and how they work.

I figured that with my recent discovery that I'm more left-brained in thinking than right-sided that I'd be a good fit since I tend to overthink things analytically. 😅

I've been told that all that is needed is to simply learn enough SQL + Tableau from Youtube/Udemy to be dangerous and then take that knowledge and make 1 project unique to me (preferably a passion project) in order to get a job with this as the portfolio item with a documented journey on it.

I do not have a college degree and do not plan on ever getting one at this point in my life. And I'd rather do a project around personal fitness metrics or perhaps what are the common winning factors that are proven to get someone in my situation an opportunity in this field.

Would you say that this is the correct assessment of what is needed? Or is there more that is needed to be demonstrated for a shot at a job? Such as Python or maybe a different tool of the trade?

Any advice or words of wisdom from the seasoned folks would be appreciated as I'm sure you have seen it all!

Thank you in advance. 🙏

(Edit: This is also intended for remote job opportunities)

Update: Thank you all for the private DMs about your experience as well as the comments here on it. Seems to me that based on the evidence while a degree is very helpful in convincing them, it's not required and it's more important that you do a project(s) that can be helpful for a business and something that you have a vested interest in building out since at the end of the day it's a numbers game for applying and interviewing and potentially hiring a resume writer to get passed the ATS system and then only focus on interviews.

ool3pd,"Recently hired by marketing firm doing data analytics, need some guidance. Probably newbie questions, at least I am aware of it. Any help would be great!","So, I have a decent grasp on data analytics and use python quite a bit, but I am fairly new to the field in general. I recently got hired by a marketing firm doing data analytics, and while I can run different tests and understand that what I am doing is pointless from an analytics standpoint, I'm not sure what I am doing from a marketing standpoint. 

For instance, I know checking for ROI on PPC ads is a must, and I can run conversions per ad and get them info that's more than what they are asking.

My current assignment is a Social Media analysis, and I can do a check of keywords vs metrics like ""Likes"", ""Comments"", ""Shares"", and all that. But I feel like there is more to it than that in the Digital Marketing space. I have done some testing that pulled information like looking at words that seem to cause posts to get more likes and hashtags that seem to be more useful than others. 

What exactly am I looking for metric-wise to do testing on to see what's working?

For example, a loan company is a client, they want to know how well their social media presence 
is doing. Do I try to get their loan data to see any correlation between people who clicked  through their social media to website to ""contact for more information""? How would I find the  link for people who submitted a contact form on the website to those that came from social  media? That would be the true proof that SM is working, right? I can follow the trend of course, but is there some metric that has a name that I am missing besides CTR?

Basically, what are the most important metrics for testing in the digital marketing field if I had to 
give my boss a list of the metrics I need in order to do my job. No one at the firm currently does Data Analytics using python, so I already have eyes on me, so far they are decently impressed, but in reality, I am just pulling stuff out of my butt and it's somehow working.

(Yes, I am over my head. That's why I'm here. However, this job is one that will make my future 
100x better as I have been out of a job for over a year due to covid, and this is finally a career launcher for me, so I want to succeed so badly since I am already in my 30s and finally have a chance to make a future for myself and my family.)",25,15,MayTheBananaBeWithYo,2021-07-21 08:06:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/ool3pd/recently_hired_by_marketing_firm_doing_data/,0,dataanalysis

This company makes a lot of money, so I’m pretty sure they don’t need help with any basic stuff (which item sells the most, which brand is the most profitable, etc…) With the data I have access to, what can I really do to impress the CEO of the company?

I am a data analyst with about a year experience. I love my job but am looking to add on some additional side-work. I feel pretty good about my pay, I make 72/yr which seems pretty in-line with the filed of analytics I am in for an entry-level role. I know the potential for growth is pretty good, but with the cost of living now I still feel like I need to start saving more fast if I want to buy a house in the next couple of years.   


I have so much down-time, I have been racking my brain for what I could do in those hours where I am just hanging out? It doesn't have to bring in a ton, as obviously this is supplemental income. The big issue is flexibility; naturally I can't take on any responsibility that would cause me to sacrifice quality on my salaried position, and I would want to do a good job on any additional work I take on. 

Does anyone have any ideas or have experience doing this? It would be nice to have a side hustle related to my skillset, but it doesn't even have to be.

*(tldr, go to the last question directly)*

Digital marketing apprentice here. I need to do some market analysis of competition and let's say I am not amazed by the idea of writting every information by hand in an Excel table. In my classes, I've been told about data scraping but never had any method to do so. 

So far I used chrome extensions to try, which worked sometimes on simple websites. I came across some topics advising on learning Python and scraping using Beautiful Soup or Selenium library. Let me precise I have no previous experience in real coding (just a one week introduction to CSS and HTML, so not much haha). However, I am not reluctant to coding, that does not ""scare me"" for say.

&#x200B;

For those who learned Python and web-scraping related techniques (and who have no IT background) : 

\- Did you self-teach? If so, was free material available online enough? 

\- How long did it take you to become operational and be able to perform the scraping you wanted?

\- Did you find it difficult? (was it a matter of time, or did you get stuck for a long time with unsolvable issues)

A task I want to start tackling soon is to clean up data that’s being entered into our system. Clients enter their own orders, so our database absorbs a ton of location names (warehouses). The names of these warehouses vary from location to location, and of course the data input by our employees can be incorrectly spelled or have several variances. An example is below:

Walmart
WAL-MART
Wallmart 
wal mart
WalMart
Wall Mart
Well art
Welmart 
Walmert 

The goal is to create a data cleanse process that would absorb these various location names and identify similar matches, and then add that similar match name to a column in a table. In the example above, I would want all of these to be matched to “Walmart”

- I get to go to cool team offsites in different cities once in a while. My teammates are all great ppl 

I used to love the idea of spending all day building dashboards on Tableau and sharing interesting insights to the broader company. But now every day I feel like I am met with more challenges than I can handle:
- I get discouraged when I make mistakes (pointed out by stakeholders or in my QC process, both are frustrating because it takes time to correct the issue)
- deadlines are stressful. I always take longer to finish a project than anticipated, so sometimes I end up working till late at night. (Then this impacts my relationships and other non work commitments)
- a lot of ppl have questions/requests for me throughout the day on slack and it’s quite time consuming and distracting to respond
- sometimes I have low discipline and would spend hours on my phone instead of working. This is my fault but there are times when I just can’t bring myself to work anymore. This creates even more stress
- I thought I could travel but the time differences make me tired and I can’t fully enjoy my travels while working 8hrs a day. It actually takes a lot of effort and planning to be able to travel and work efficiently
- because work takes a lot of my time and energy I feel like I’m not growing in other aspects of my life (developing soft skills, work on my hobbies, reconnecting w friends and families, learning and researching topics that interest me). I feel like I’m becoming a dull and boring person with major social anxiety because  I spend all day interacting with a computer.

I often day dream of doing something completely different than tech and data. To take a break so to speak. Have you gone through something similar? How did you deal with this dread?

Why do you want to work in analytics in the first place? Do you actually love working as a data analyst or are mainly doing it because of money? If it’s the former, please enlighten me about what is so great/satisfying about this work.",25,23,sweet_candy123,2022-10-31 23:08:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/yirwih/i_seem_to_have_the_perfect_data_job_but_im/,0,dataanalysis

I've recently realized the I need to make my code more efficient, readable, and easier to debug. If you're having this same realization, join me in a free SQL workshop,[ ***SQL Patterns Every Analyst Should Know***](https://www.operationalanalytics.club/events/workshop-ergest-xheblati?utm_campaign=Parker%20Rogers%20-%20Organic%20Social%20Campaign&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_content=post-ergest-webinar), on October 13th!

We'll learn from[ Ergest Xheblati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ergestxheblati/), Author of[ *Minimum Viable SQL Patterns*](https://ergestx.gumroad.com/l/sqlpatterns) , as he teaches:

* **Query composition patterns -** How to make your complex queries shorter, more legible, and more performant
* **Query maintainability patterns -** Constructing CTEs that can be reused. In software engineering, it's called the DRY principle (don't repeat yourself)
* **Query robustness patterns -** Constructing queries that don't break when the underlying data changes in unpredictable ways
* **Query performance patterns -** Make your queries faster (and cheaper) regardless of specific database you’re using
* **Answers to your questions -** Ask Ergest whatever you'd like in the live and interactive Q&A

193kttl,Just got a promotion!,"Hey, long time lurker, first time poster.

Looking from some advice/professional opinions from others in the field, as I have no-one else irl who I can really ask.

So, I just recently got a promotion from data analyst to senior data analyst.

The senior data analyst role includes managing a small team of data analysts. For this reason I queried whether it would be possible to change the job title a little to reflect that it is also a team leader post. My employer is open to this and recently came back saying they have changed it to ‘senior data analyst - team leader’.

I’m worried this title looks a little weird, almost looks like two different jobs. I have done some research by checking other jobs that are out there and haven’t found anything similar. 

Should I suggest they change it again to ‘data analytics team leader’? I worry this might be perceived as more of a managerial role and not show my expertise in the field, which a senior analyst title does in my opinion.

Am I over thinking this? Is this strange compared to the way similar job titles might be worded in our area of work

Love to hear what others in senior roles think on this and what other titles you might suggest that clearly describe the role.

TLDR: been promoted to senior analyst. Going to be managing a team. Requested a title change. Employee came back with ‘senior data analyst - team leader’.

18c710m,Tips to become more organised when approaching a project?," The title pretty much summarises it, but for more context:

I am a DA with 3 years of experience, slightly above average IQ and I'm not too bad in the technical skills department.

Where I really struggle is to be organised when I approach a new project or an analysis. I tend to get lost in tiny insignificant details that make me waste time.

Another issue is related to the approach to follow. I could spend most of my time developing a solution only to find out that it was not the right angle to pursue or that I forgot to validate some assumptions.

I usually feel mostly lost when approaching a new project, with little to no ideas as where to start.

Has anyone experienced something similar? How did you solve you lack of organization?

I would appreciate advices. I enjoy my job but at times I feel really stupid for the reasons i mentioned above. This makes working as a DA frustrating.

Just to start off, I didn't get the job unfortunately. 

But this is how it went:

They first emailed me about a week or so after I submitted my application online asking for a phone call at a given date and time. Come that day, I got a call and the interviewer (who was very upbeat and enthusiastic) gave me an outline of what he was looking for in my responses to his questions: projects done, positions/roles held, time span, accomplishments, goals, barriers, etc. I think I forgot about this and did my usual elevator pitch (which did include most of what he was looking for but I wasn’t actively thinking about answering them. Like when he asked what coding languages besides SQL i had experience in, I forgot to tell him how long I’ve had experience with them. 

Overall the call was about 15 minutes. He didn’t give me the opportunity to ask him questions which was odd for me but I’m guessing that because they’re so well known that it’s not needed to show you researched them.

I’m not sure if not fully answering the criteria he was looking for in my responses is what killed me or they just found a better candidate. Either way, I think it was a good experience. 

I actually ended up getting a remote job with a government contracting company that I interned with last summer. I did have to use some nepotism (family connections) unfortunately to get the job so I don’t really have any advice for you guys on how I got the job. But as a soon college grad I’ll take what I can get just to get my foot in the door.

Anyways, thank you guys so much for all the encouragement and advice!

zw64vm,how data analysis tasks can be automated using python?,"I heard a lot about excel tasks can be automated using python but don't understand what exactly can be automated?

Is there anyone who knows how it's done ? Or how else can we use python for analysis expect some eda, basic visualizations and ML tasks.",23,14,captaintyler98,2022-12-27 04:06:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/zw64vm/how_data_analysis_tasks_can_be_automated_using/,0,dataanalysis
zvzy84,Degree vs. Self-teaching Pros and Cons,"I (23f) have a BS in ethics, history, and public policy (yes, that's one major), looking to potentially transition into a career as a data analyst. I am wondering if I should invest the time and money into getting a master's degree in a relevant program when I know the resources exist to teach myself relevant skills and build a portfolio on my own time. 

Is there any significant advantage to taking up a master's in the subject, especially since my degree is so unrelated? (although I did take statistics classes, learned R, and have a project to display for it)

My personal situation: I have a full-time sales job now--my first real job out of college, it kind of fell in my lap, but I am finding that the sales lifestyle is not for me. I have a good bit of $ saved up, only $8k in student loans from my bachelor's, a car loan, but otherwise, I'm in a good position financially if I had to drop to part-time work to go to school. Truthfully, I love being a student, but I don't want to use it as a cop out from my current unfulfilled state if there's a better alternative.",23,19,None,2022-12-26 23:16:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/zvzy84/degree_vs_selfteaching_pros_and_cons/,0,dataanalysis
