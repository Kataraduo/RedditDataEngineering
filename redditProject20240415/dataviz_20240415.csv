nufitx,"What do you think of a no-code tool that can help you to interact with databases (like MongoDB, PostgreSQL) and APIs?","Trying to explore data from databases isn’t the most fun thing to do for a non-technical person. Is it?

That’s why we are building a tool to interact with databases and APIs. So anybody can explore data at a much faster speed than before. You don’t have to write a single line of code and any non-technical user can use it

Currently, we are testing with DynamoDB, PostgreSQL and SQL.

Is there anything that we should keep in mind while building it?

We are looking for some feedback.

If anyone would like early access please comment below and I’ll send you a link.

Does anyone see this being helpful? Would love to hear your feedback!

Thanks in advance!

ul16pp,"Started implementing Bret Victors ideas from ""Drawing Dynamic Visulizations""","Hi,

in 2013 Bret Victor gave a talk called ""Drawing Dynamic Visualizations"", where he demonstrates a software, that allows the user to create data driven graphics by primarily using tools and functions known from drawing software. To my knowledge he never published the software. So some months ago I started implementing my own version of his ideas as a web application.

At [https://dapentry.com](https://dapentry.com) you can find a first, early version of my progress so far. You can

* Draw basic shapes: Rectangles, circles, Lines, Polygons
* Use basic transformations: Move, rotate, scale
* Change some style: Fill color, stroke color, stroke width
* Use simple text objects
* Loop things
* Create data fields for: Single values, value lists and tables
* Use data fields in the drawing to make shapes and transformations dependend on data
* Export the drawing as SVG
* Export the drawing as a JS-library to use on your own website.
* You can create an account and store your designs in a global library (this functionality is very basic)
* You can use drawings from the library in your own drawing (cannot be exported to JS right now)

Maybe some of you want to check it out. I'd appreciate it. There's definetely bugs and it can sometimes be finicky to use.

At [https://cheat.dapentry.com](https://cheat.dapentry.com) is a cheat sheet. Documentation is in the works.

There's also stuff missing I'd like to add like

* Support the instancing of drawings in JS-export
* Conditional drawing: Bret didn't use it in his presentation but discusses it in the talk notes on his website
* Make colors data dependent
* Drawing arcs
* Bezier curves
* Snapping to intersections
* ...

I think data visualization is really interesting and want to pivot the career that way. I have basic SQL and tableau experience. Would you recommend solely focusing on tableau to take my first step into this career path? Or are there any other recommendations (like picking SQL back up from my studies while getting my bachelor's)?

&#x200B;

I'm trying to build a heatmap of users in decentraland. I have a cool dataset of player status (location, etc) every 5 seconds for the past 2 years, and all logged events. It's pretty amazing .

&#x200B;

I have a lot of analysis I want to do - namely, session analysis (which people go to which scenes, how much they spend, etc).

&#x200B;

But i'm starting with a very simple task. I want to make a heatmap - first, of player locations. Secondly, a live map / gif of ""trajectories."" I've made the dataframe for the trajectories of coordinates, and i can also get user coordinates for a given time period.

​

If this was something like a kaggle dataset of, say, taxis in new york, I could use something like folium for mapping. But there are no mapping solutions for decentraland AFAIK.

​

I have found the decentraland tiles api - specifically this right here. A fellow engineer said this is the best data source for map tiles: [https://api.decentraland.org/v2/tiles](https://api.decentraland.org/v2/tiles)

jrp18e,Data Visualization: Best Tips and Practices,"Data visualization: the art of communicating information through visuals.

Businesses today should rely on the biggest amount of data available to make the smartest and most well-informed business decisions.

*How do customers move through my digital store?*

*What's the performance of my sales team?*

These complex systems are hard to understand, much less fix, if you are not able to have a clear picture of the processes underneath.

Thanks to data visualization, making information understandable and actionable can now be an easy and affordable task for everyone.

However, there's a catch!

Putting complex numbers and other pieces of information into graphs is not enough.

Anyone working with data needs to follow data visualization best practices to present that data in a way that's easier and understandable for the audience. 

But how do you make data visualizations easy to understand, on-point, appealing, and never misleading?

In this article, an exceptional data analyst talks about the best practices when it comes to data visualizations and offers some great design tips.

I would appreciate if anyone here can please help me.

I have 24 items that I have ranked in 4 different ways from 1-24.

Is there a way I can show this all on one graph so that one can get an idea of all the rankings in one visually compelling figure?

Something similar to [this](https://imgur.com/a/mDeQ9Nk), but I have to combine 4 rankings in one figure.

I want to change it so that the lines are green when bullish grey when neutral and red when bearish.

Is this possible in google sheets? or would I need excel? or another simpleton friendly package?

sj715r,What tool can generate thousands dataviz reports (besides Python)?,"Hi everyone,

Looking for a software/technology advice.

I am tasked with creating custom dataviz report with multiple charts and graphs on one page. The catch is I need to generate hundreds if not thousands of those reports out of a single database.

The obvious solution would be something like **Python, Pandas and Seaborn**, I could even email the reports automatically that way. But I was thinking maybe there is something more user friendly than Python like **Excel VBA, Google Slides** or some inexpensive paid tool that can do the job.

The reason I am hesitant about Python:

* it will not be easy to customize the report with custom icons etc. (i am beginner to intermediate level)
* Once I write the script it will be harder for colleagues to use than say Excel VBA doc.

When it comes to data visualization, I am extremely unexperienced. However, I'm willing to learn and have got the time to do so! I am not even sure if this is the right sub for this question, so please feel free to redirect me to another sub.

I've been working on putting together a portfolio for quite some time now, but as of yet, they're just images on my computer. A while ago I came up with the idea of visualizing the relations between my artworks by placing them in a network. I think that would make for a good interactive and dynamic way to share my work, rather than just putting them on a website and make people scroll through them. My idea is to create links between artworks based on similarity in concept, similarity in style, perhaps also date of production.

However, besides creating these links or connections on paper (or in my head), I have no clue what's the best way to go about it. Perhaps you guys know where to go from here on?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!",2,3,LuitBokking,2019-12-12 23:13:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataviz/comments/e9vc7d/network_visualization_for_art/,0,dataviz

afw5ek,What tool would you use?,"To create an overview of how a reporting software works.

I've taken it upon myself to build a data mapping visualization tool that's intended to explain to laymen how specific reports are generated. The reports themselves are aggregated marketing data from one or more softwares. So a single report might capture similar datapoints from multiple sources, the report itself to give the human an understanding of accuracy of their data sources & a general overview of statistics for their project or business.

The idea I'm trying to bring to life is a visualization tool that would represent said reports by stating which metrics from which softwares were used in said reports. Their (branded perhaps) names in our software, their names in the software they're sourced from (if different) and perhaps the name of the API call generating said metric's value.

[This is a rough outline of what I'm imagining.](https://imgur.com/a/2Xr0JCw)

Thing is, I am not sure what the right tools or visualization libraries are that can help me generate what I need to make this work. Basically I'd like a user to be able to see where data is coming from, and what other reports that data is used for.

8u55d2,"Flexible, high-performance javascript charting library for the web?","I'm looking for a high performance flexible/extensible javascript-based charting library for the web. I've looked around and there are a few that ticks certain boxes - some more than others - but so far nothing that's a total package.

Things I need:

* High performance; ability to handle huge data sets.
* Ability to accept data as functions (preferably asynchronous, via callbacks or promises), rather than having to pass in enormous arrays.
* Interactive; ability to set markers and comments on points. Ability to pan and zoom, e.g. by click+drag and/or with a range selector.
* Different types of charts, e.g. line, area, stacked area, candlestick, bar, stacked bar, etc. (Don't think I need pie).
* Multiple series with multiple axes (e.g. 1 horizontal axis for ""time"", and an axis on left for ""$"", and an axis on right for ""quantity"", etc).
* Ability to overlay multiple series and series types on top of one another (e.g. stacked area + line, or bar + line, etc.).
* Ability to specify curve interpolation, e.g. D3's [curve interpolator](http://bl.ocks.org/emmasaunders/c25a147970def2b02d8c7c2719dc7502): `d3.curveLinear`, `d3.curveStepBefore`, `d3.curveStepAfter`, etc.
* Themeable: need to be able to change the overall appearance of the chart. (light, dark, colourblind, etc). Legend on side vs. legend on bottom, etc.
* Dynamic: if new data becomes available, it should ideally gracefully add new data to the chart.
* Resizeable.
* Ideally, free/open-source licence.

I've considered writing my own library. I've put a little bit of time into planning it, and even written quite a bit of code for it. It's a rather large and difficult undertaking - maybe too much for just myself - and it would be really great if there was already a library that did most if not all this.

18bbzwf,I am building a tool to automate data cleaning and consolidation (Feedback please),"Hi Redditors,

I built a tool that allows you to standardize manually entered data using generative AI. So all similar phrases are automatically harmonized, enabling you to run improved data analytics.

[https://www.dataharmonizer.com/](https://www.dataharmonizer.com/)

\> Correct for inconsistencies in spelling (Coop vs co-op)

\> Harmonize shortcuts (Limited vs Ltd.)

\> Correct for spelling mistakes (serbices vs services)

This is how the tool works:

* You can upload a CSV file and specify which row to extract and harmonize.
* The model automatically consolidates data by combining similar-looking phrases.
* You can edit the proposed phrase names or further consolidate entries if there are some groups the model has missed.
* In the end, you can download your CSV file again.

I would highly appreciate feedback from the community on what I can improve! I really appreciate any help you can provide.",1,0,Apprehensive_Cut9179,2023-12-05 13:30:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataviz/comments/18bbzwf/i_am_building_a_tool_to_automate_data_cleaning/,0,dataviz

* i have a store
* i dont work there every day
* i have data for each daily income/transaction, with one column with a date and one column with the amount of money
* In the end i want to see that the daily income sums up to more than what i am paying in rent, but thats next step i suppose

Do i want a bar graph, and if so **how do you make those if the dates are not following each other sequentially**?  I prefer to do this in google sheets, btw.

How would I go about doing this?

When I create a slicer, it just works on one column and displays the values (eg. obesity rate, 16%, 17%).

Is there any way to create a slicer for choosing which column to plot against the state names?

91t0a4,Need help finding the right visualization in Rstudio,"I am looking for the best way to graph the correlation between a predictive score and a manual label in sets of data over time. In the process, a system predicts the likelihood that a user will label a document as ‘yes’ or ‘no’, and provides a set for the user once a day. I’m trying to display the progression of the correlation between high scores from the system and actual calls by the user. But I can’t find an effective way to represent all three ‘dimensions’ of the data. The data looks like this:

https://preview.redd.it/8qtiyc1984c11.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=302eccfa65dec0126194aae1ae5a18aacbcada1e

Each date (15 days total) has four lines to delineate the four possible labels. Columns 4-13 show the different 10 point ranges of the system scores

What I’d like is to have the date on the x axis, the number of labels applied on the y axis, and use the label applied as an aesthetic to differentiate the calls being made. My first thought was a density plot like the one below, but that’s missing one more dimension to show the system score. Any help you can give with the best way to visualize this data would be greatly appreciated.

8qbo0o,Advice on visualizing a currently very busy scatter plot,"[Plot in question](https://imgur.com/YqFH7LO)

I'm trying to put together some visualizations as I tie up a project and have hit this wall. I have 5 groups of simulated data of different identities (groups 1, 3 and 5 are mostly around the origin). I then also have a set of non-simulated data (in black) (labels all changed here to try to make explaining it easier).

In short, I'm trying to demonstrate that ""value 1"" and ""value 2"" can be used to select points in the real data that are most likely to be in the simulated population 2 group. As a result, I need to simultaneously show where the simulated populations and real data fall. The simulated groups are too sparse to get decent looking 2d histograms or contours out of (and simulating enough to fill them out would take months). If I put the real data on top, the clumping near the origin makes it difficult to see where the approximate boundaries of the different groups are, so the current version has the simulated data on top of the real data with very low opacity. 

It works **okay** as is, but I've had to keep the points quite small, and it's still trickier to read than I'd like. I'm wondering if someone here might have any ideas about how to present this better.

8p3oef,Bubble Charts: Are Square plots more effective?,"It's harder to tell the actual boundaries of a circle than it is with a square. For example, if I showed you a square and circle side by side, it would he harder to tell if they have the same width/height. That is, if the values on the X or Y axes help you determine the relative size of each plot, wouldn't having the plots be square be more effective than dots?   

At a glance, circles are effective because you can compare them, but when you want to measure the size of them individually and use the values on the axes to do so, it seems that squares can help you define those boundaries more easily, no?

6iu2vb,Best BI tools for combo charts?,"I have an analytics application which currently lives in Excel. One of the charts I made in Excel is a stacked column + scatter combo. Sounds dumb, but for the purposes of the visualisation it is perfect.

We are replatforming the application into something more robust, and we have everything nailed down with the exception of our reporting layer.

Already having a license for Power BI I started playing with that. And for the majority of the work it was perfect. I would be able to create charts with dynamic metadata and publish them to the web. Ideal.

However when I came to this stacked column + scatter combo, there is no such visualisation in Power BI. Nor does it exist as a custom visualisation that I can find. 

I'm looking into the possibility of finding a contractor who will build this custom visualisation for Power BI -- however what would really be nice is if I could just get an off-the-shelf package, similar to Power BI, which allows creation of such combos out of the box (like Excel does!).

I'm a tad overwhelmed by the sheer number of solutions out there, so I'm just wondering if anyone has any hints as to where I should start.

Thanks in advance.",1,0,the1ine,2017-06-22 15:07:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataviz/comments/6iu2vb/best_bi_tools_for_combo_charts/,0,dataviz

5banmb,What kind of information can be interpreted from my project?,"Hi, everyone. I'm a final year student in computer science. I'm having problem/explanation related to data visualization in my final year project.

Basically, my project is for calculating the cost of producing a product in business Food & Beverages.
What the app does is user input how many units they want to produce the product ( e.g: 100 burgers ) and let the user input all the cost (material cost, indirect labor, production cost and etc ) and comes up with the final cost of producing the product ( e.g: RM208.95 to produce 100 burgers).

I have accounting lecturer as my co-supervisor to help me with the accounting formula. It's not a big deal. Since I'm a computer science student, my lecturer wants me to include a complexity in my project and I want to add data visualization technique ( I want to try new things). Any idea what data/information can I present by doing data visualization? Since data visualization is dealing with ton of data and interpret new information from it.

My project based on Android Application.

544a28,From Set of Data to interactive mind map? Looking for a tool.,"Hi guys, I am a medical student looking for some clues for visualizing data. Do you guys know of a possibility to create a set of data (e.g. excel) which is directly integrated into a visual mind map/flow chart, without me doing any arrow drawing? All the necessary data input would be made in the data set.
For example, a pharmaceutical acts on different pathways/molecules in the human body in different ways. To put this in a graphic is easy. But there are a lot of other substances which affect the same and different pathways. I am looking for a tool which gives me the big picture and lets me see all the connections and interactions made by pharmaceutical#1. And once made can be easily changed due to new scientific research. Thanks a lot!

17p7ohp,South Africa's Rugby World Cup Campaign," Hi everyone, I'd like to share a personal project I did about the Springboks RWC Campaign. I'd love to get your feedback as PowerBI people, to get your unique perspective. We only use Tableau at so I thought I'd overcome confirmation bias by getting your guys' opinions.

The project is basically match stats for all the games the Springboks played in all championships in 2023. You can see those who are consistently performing well. The stats come from [SA Rugby](https://www.sarugby.co.za/match-centre/?teamId=e976cfc2-f80b-4c1a-8472-838cd54f0fbc&returnUrl=/sa-teams-players/springboks/)

Each match has highlight reels of the players' game contributions (71 total). The project also covers all the matches that the Boks under Rassie have played NZ (5 Wins, 5 Losses & 1 Draw).

Ultimately, the project shows how tough this World Cup was & the pressure the team faced, especially in the knockout phases.

PS. I think this would be great for those new to rugby, since it covers the biggest matches in the sport with highlight reels to see the entertaining stuff.

You can check out the full work here: [https://public.tableau.com/views/Springboks2023RugbyWorldCupCampaign/TheSpringboks2023Campaign?:language=en-US&:display\_count=n&:origin=viz\_share\_link](https://public.tableau.com/views/Springboks2023RugbyWorldCupCampaign/TheSpringboks2023Campaign?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
