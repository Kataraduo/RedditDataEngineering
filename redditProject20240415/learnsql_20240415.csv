zybk5o,2023 Update: The Best Resources for Learning SQL,"As an experienced software engineer with over 7 years of experience, I want to share with you the list of resources I used to learn SQL. I have found these resources to be extremely helpful in my own learning journey and they can be of great value to others as well. Whether you are a beginner looking to get started with SQL or an experienced developer looking to refresh your knowledge, these resources will provide you with the necessary foundation and skills to become proficient in SQL. So, without further ado, here is my list of top resources for learning SQL:

1. The SQL courses offered by Standford on [EDX](https://www.edx.org/bio/jennifer-widom) and instructed by Jennifer Widom are suitable for both beginners and experienced software engineers looking to refresh their knowledge. These courses are free and provide a comprehensive education in SQL, covering a wide range of topics from the fundamentals to advanced concepts such as introduction to relational databases, advanced topics in SQL, Modeling and theory and Semistructured Data. Through interactive quizzes, hands-on exercises, and real-world examples, these courses provide valuable insights and practical skills for anyone looking to learn or improve their SQL skills.
2. [Database Systems The Complete Book](https://amzn.to/3YTG4BA) is an excellent resource for advanced topics in database systems, including database system implementation, data mining, concurrency control, transaction management, and parallel and distributed databases. While the first part of the book serves as a good foundation, the advanced topics covered in the later sections are particularly noteworthy. I have had this book for several years and continue to refer back to it on a regular basis. If you are looking to master advanced concepts related to RDBMS and SQL in particular, I highly recommend adding this book to your library. It will be a valuable resource in your journey towards expertise in database systems.
3. The sixth edition of [Database System Concepts](https://amzn.to/3Wy3wCG) is a widely respected text in database education. It introduces basic and fundamental concepts in a straightforward manner and aims to help students start working with databases as soon as possible. The book is divided into ten sections, covering topics such as relational databases, system architecture, speciality databases, and transaction management. It also includes chapters on object-relational mapping, relevance ranking using terms, and distributed data storage. This edition includes revised coverage of SQL, with a focus on the variations of SQL used in actual systems and SQL features. It also introduces new material on support vector machines and the validation of classifiers. The text emphasizes practical applications and implementation, while also providing comprehensive coverage of key theoretical concepts. Algorithms and concepts are presented in a general setting, with annotations and variations specific to particular database systems also included. The only prerequisites for understanding the book are familiarity with computer organization, basic data structures, and a high-level programming language. This edition, published by Tata McGraw-Hill Education in 2013, features a new running example of a university database and more complex design tradeoffs in the database design chapters.
4. The 3rd edition of [Learning SQL: Generate, Manipulate, and Retrieve Data](https://amzn.to/3WPuC8b) is a useful resource for those new to SQL. In comparison to other books on the subject, this one is relatively easy to read and has some helpful content. While it may not be my go-to resource for advanced concepts, it could be a useful starting point for those just getting started with SQL. It's always helpful to have multiple resources at one's disposal when learning a new skill, and this book could definitely be a useful addition to a beginner's toolkit.
5. I highly recommend the [Fundamentals of Data Engineering: Plan and Build Robust Data Systems](https://amzn.to/3vqDPYQ) book to anyone interested in data engineering. Although the book is not directly about SQL, it covers a wide range of topics that are essential for building robust data systems. The book is structured around the ""Data Engineering Lifecycle,"" with chapters devoted to ingestion, storage, transformation, serving, cloud economics, data models, schema, security, and more. Each chapter includes best practices and potential pitfalls, making it an invaluable resource for anyone looking to learn about data engineering. In my experience, this book has been an absolute game-changer. It is very clearly laid out and covers all the key concepts in great detail. Whether you are a beginner looking to get started with data engineering or an experienced developer looking to expand your knowledge, this book is a must-read. I have no doubt that it will become an invaluable resource for anyone who picks it up.

In conclusion, the books mentioned in this post are all excellent resources for learning SQL and data engineering. Whether you are a beginner looking to get started with these important programming languages or an experienced developer looking to refresh your knowledge and skills, these books will provide you with the foundation and guidance you need to succeed. It's important to remember that not all resources are created equal, and it's important to choose ones that align with your learning style and goals. Avoid wasting time on resources that are not helpful or that don't provide the depth of knowledge you need. Each book has its own unique strengths and approaches, so be sure to consider which one aligns best with your needs. And remember, it's always a good idea to have multiple resources at your disposal, so don't be afraid to supplement your learning with online courses, tutorials, and other materials as well.

ofkjxv,FREE Course on Advanced SQL,"Hey Everybody,

I've created a course on advanced SQL querying/data analysis techniques that I'd like to share with you guys. Here's the link to get the course for free on Udemy (FYI - the coupon expires in three days): [https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-sql-server-masterclass-for-data-analysis/?couponCode=FREE-ADVANCED-SQL](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-sql-server-masterclass-for-data-analysis/?couponCode=FREE-ADVANCED-SQL). Of course, I appreciate any feedback you can provide!

The course picks up where introductory books/courses leave off, starting with Window Functions and moving on to topics like subqueries/CTEs, temp tables, query optimization, and even a little procedural SQL programming. There's also an abundance of coding exercises, some quite challenging, sprinkled throughout the course to reinforce the concepts.

SQL Server is used for the examples and exercises, but most of the content would be applicable to the vast majority of database systems.

Please note that this is an *advanced* course, so I'm assuming you have a solid background in SQL foundations: applying criteria with WHERE, JOINs, aggregate queries, etc.. If you'd like a refresher on these concepts, I've also created a free coupon for my intro SQL course here: [https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-basics-crash-course-with-sql-server/?couponCode=FREE-SQL](https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-basics-crash-course-with-sql-server/?couponCode=FREE-SQL).

I learned a while ago that I really love working with and interpreting data (of course, learned this after I got a degree in graphic design).

e2kt8e,I've made SQL course based on real examples from running a company,"Hi everyone, my name is Anatoli, I'm the author of [SQL Habit](https://www.sqlhabit.com/) 👋

For the past 10 years I've been working as a Software Engineer and Data Analyst, made and sold my own startup (language learning platform). Through these experiences I've learned how data is used in automation, helps to make business or product decisions, removes unnecessary discussions based on guessing rather than concrete numbers.

Another problem is that most of SQL courses use bookish examples. How can it help with real work?

This is why I've made SQL Habit – a course that is:

* **actionable.** Everything you'll learn could be immediately applied in your work. For example conversion analysis or calculating ROI of a marketing campaign.
* **interactive.** You'll take lessons and do exercises where you need to type actual SQL and run queries in the data warehouse of a fictional company.
* **bite-sized.** Each lesson is designed to be 10-15 minutes long so you can make progress every day.

Here's the link to the website: [https://www.sqlhabit.com/](https://www.sqlhabit.com/). I must mention that first 25 lessons are free + there's a Black Friday sale till next week.

pb93pn,Analyze Crime Data and make a Data Visualization in this 30 Minute Intro to SQL,"I'm gonna post the full tutorial here, but if you'd like all the pictures in one place, here you go: [https://app.sixweeksql.com/blog?title=Intro-to-SQL-Crash-Course](https://app.sixweeksql.com/blog?title=Intro-to-SQL-Crash-Course)

&#x200B;

In this tutorial, we will...

* Download a tool for writing and executing SQL
* Use SQL to analyze data
* Learn how to create a simple data visualization

**This tutorial is not intended to give you an in-depth explanation of how SQL works, or to go into any technical details of databases. The goal is to show you how SQL can be used in a hands-on approach.**

You can view the images linked here along with the full tutorial [here](https://app.sixweeksql.com/blog)

&#x200B;

**It All Starts With the Data**

Lets download some data from [Louisville Open Data](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/). The dataset we are going to use is crime data collected by the city of Louisville, KY from 2018. [You can download it here](http://lky-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/LMPD/Crime_Data_2018.csv) directly or on the [Louisville Open Data Crime Reports page](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/crime-reports)

After you've downloaded the data set, let's take a look at it. You can view it with excel, some other spreadsheet program, or just notepad, if that's all you have. This dataset is formatted as a [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) (comma-separated values). Each row is on its own line, and each value is separated by a comma.

Here is what it looks like if viewed in a spreadsheet program. Note that a spreadsheet program will not show the commas. If you're viewing in a plain text editor, like notepad, it will look much different.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/crime-rows.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/crime-rows.png)

It looks like every row represents a reported crime. This is a pretty interesting dataset if you ask me. Personally, I have so many questions!

* Which zip codes experience the most car theft?
* What times of the day are crimes most likely to occur?
* Which crimes are most popular?

Without some type of technology to aid us, answering these questions would be difficult, to say the least. There are almost 80,000 rows in this spreadsheet. Lucky for us, we are going to use SQL to aid us in our efforts. Lets get started!

&#x200B;

**Download a tool so we can use SQL**

We need a **SQL client** that can interpret and execute SQL. For this tutorial, we will use **DB Browser for SQLite**. Its a simple and light weight tool that is used to manage data. It knows how to interpret and execute SQL. [You can download the tool here](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)

If you've got a somewhat newer windows pc, you probably have a 64 bit machine, and can download the version highlighted below.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/download-db-browser.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/download-db-browser.png)

After its downloaded, right click the file and choose **Extract All**

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/extract.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/extract.png)

Once the zip file is extracted, navigate to the **DB Browser for SQLite** folder and find the **DB Browser for SQLite** Application file (exe). Open the application.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/application.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/application.png)

Once you start the application, you should see it open. It looks like this:

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/app-view.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/app-view.png)

&#x200B;

**Create a Database**

A database is just a container for your data, and we will need one for this tutorial. Select **New Database**

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/new-db.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/new-db.png)

Type in a name for your database (I named mine crime), and click **Save**.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/save-db-file.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/save-db-file.png)

A window will pop up that prompts you to create a new table inside of your database. Just close it.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/close-prompt.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/close-prompt.png)

Import Louisville Crime Data

Next, we will use the **import** tool provided by **DB Browser for SQLite** to get our Louisville Crime dataset loaded into it. File > Import > Table From CSV File...

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/import.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/import.png)

Find and select your Louisville Crime dataset that you downloaded earlier and click **Open**

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/find-crime.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/find-crime.png)

The **DB Browser for SQLite** import tool is going to use our csv (comma separated values) file to create a database table. You can pick the name of the database table at this step. I've shortened my table name to **Crime**. Click **Okay** once you're ready to create the table.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/import-wizard.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/import-wizard.png)

Under the **Database Structure** tab, you should now see the new table listed.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/new-table.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/new-table.png)

&#x200B;

**Start Writing Some SQL**

If you've gotten this far, pat yourself on the back! We are now ready to execute our first bit of SQL. Navigate to the **Execute SQL** tab and enter the SQL you see below. We are going to select all columns (\*) from the **Crime** table, but only the first 10 rows. If you named your table something other than crime, you will need to use that name instead. Click the execute SQL button once you're ready to execute your SQL.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/execute-tab.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/execute-tab.png)

You should see the results of your query below the text editor, where you typed in your SQL.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/first-result.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/first-result.png)

You can adjust the size of the results window by hovering over the right edge.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/adjust-grid.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/adjust-grid.png)

Let's write our next SQL query. Copy the SQL you see below and execute it. Examine the SQL, and the results. Are they what you expected?

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/assault-query.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/assault-query.png)

Next, lets edit our query to only show assaults that occurred in zip code 40215. Check out the extra information below the grid. It indicates there were 821 rows returned.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/assaults-40215.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/assaults-40215.png)

This query will yield each unique value found in the **CRIME\_TYPE** column. It looks lilke there are 16 different crime types in the table.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/distinct-crime-type.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/distinct-crime-type.png)

**If you're up to it, try running some of your own queries. It is okay if you don't know exactly what you're doing. Experimenting and learning through discovery is the best way to learn in my opinion**

Using the extra information below the results grid, lets see how many burglaries were reported in 2018.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/burglary-count.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/burglary-count.png)

Now lets see how many homicides were reported in 2018

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/homicide-count.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/homicide-count.png)

How do you think the **GROUP BY** command works?

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/group-by.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/group-by.png)

Here we can use the **GROUP BY** command on the ZIP\_CODE column to get a count of crimes reported in each zip code.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/group-by-zip.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/group-by-zip.png)

Add this **WHERE** clause so we can get a count of vehicle break-ins for each zip code. The **NULL** value indicates there was no data entered in the zip code for 350 rows.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/group-by-zip-vehicle.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/group-by-zip-vehicle.png)

You can add the **ORDER BY** clause to order the results by a particular column.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/order-by.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/order-by.png)

We can add another condition onto our **WHERE** clause to exclude the ***NULL*** values. Usually, you will use the **<>** or **!=** operators when you want to specify ""not equal to"", but NULL values are different.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/not-null.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/not-null.png)

**Create a Data Visualization**

Next up, we are going to create a data visualization like the one below

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/bar-chart.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/bar-chart.png)

Let's go back to our query where we group by crime type and get a count

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/group-by.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/group-by.png)

Execute the query, and click the upper left corner of the graph. This will select the data. You can copy it with **control + c**.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/select-data.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/select-data.png)

Head to [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/). It is an online tool for creating data visualizations. You do not need an account to use the tool. Click the **Start Creating** button to get started

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/start-creating.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/start-creating.png)

Paste the data you copied from **DB Browser for SQLite** with **control + v**

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/paste.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/paste.png)

Click proceed to go to the next step

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/proceed.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/proceed.png)

Despite our data being haphazardly pasted in, the tool did a good job formatting it for us. Click Proceed to go to the next step.

ah5esp,Self-taught SQL learning roadmap?,"Hello all, 

I'm looking for advice on how to start my career as an entry-level data analyst of some sort. I have been dabbling with CS50 and SQLZOO for the most part. My plan is to learn SQL and Tableau efficient enough to work on some projects (probably gaming related or NBA stats related) to present on my resume/portfolio. However, I'm not sure when I will be 'job-ready' and should start applying. I'm a recent business and economics grad who really didn't have to work all that much with programming in my degree. I'm planning to do some certifications later on, but the next semester starts in May. To be honest, I'm looking to commit 5 hours a day until May so I'd hope to be 'job-ready' before then and only take certifications should I have trouble finding a job.

Has anyone taken a similar path? When did you know you were proficient enough to start job searching?",37,23,khien3,2019-01-18 01:56:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/ah5esp/selftaught_sql_learning_roadmap/,0,learnsql

11uizdv,W3Schools is a much better resource to learn SQL than Select Star SQL,"Basically the title. Not only Select Star SQL misses many basic SQL operations, but its explanations are both unnecessarily complicated and miss lots of details. On top of that you spend half of your time reading about the executions in the US.

W3schools is the complete opposite: lots of clearly structured lessons with clear examples and straightforward explanations. Perhaps that's the best resource to learn SQL currently available.

EDIT1: I should add that I already had some programming experience before learning SQL, and therefore some SQL principles were more intuitive to me, like functions, return values, aggregations etc. Perhaps for a complete beginner even W3School might be challenging in certain aspects

EDIT2: W3Schools has two SQL courses: SQL and MySQL. They're almost the same, and the main difference is in that the SQL one contains explanations for several different SQL dialects, and is a bit inconsistent, while MySQL one focuses solely on MySQL. I did both, and I would personally recommend to get straight into MySQL. In my opinion MySQL is the best SQL dialect for beginners, as it's the most widely used open-source SQL dialect

EDIT3: If anyone prefers to learn from videos, I would highly recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S_tz1z_5bA&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh) as an alternative to using W3Schools (though you can also use both)",35,10,somerandomdud4,2023-03-18 09:04:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/11uizdv/w3schools_is_a_much_better_resource_to_learn_sql/,0,learnsql
gwiv67,Anyone interested in a comprehensive learning resource?,"Hey Everyone,
I'm working on a website with comprehensive learning journeys for various topics. Is anyone interested in learning SQL within the context of related technologies? For instance, my BI journey, covers Excel, SQL, data modeling, Power BI and databases. The journey for being a data analyst includes Excel, SQL, basic data modeling, Tableau, Python and statistics. 

We're still in development and testing, and I'd love to get feedback from new learners and experienced people. 

The idea is you learn increasingly complex skills and complete real-world projects on the way. This way you not only learn SQL, but how to apply it in real environments so you can get a better job. 

Everything is free (will be ad supported). 

If anyone is interested, send me a PM and I'll provide a signup key. If you are only interested in SQL, that's fine. You can just do the SQL parts.

I don't know that I have an interest in making anything more than a part-time or temporary career out of this, but I am wondering if it would be possible to get a job in the $30k-$40k range that would only require basic programming skills and an ability to run queries on databases, as far as purely technical skills anyway. I was thinking a junior data analyst position might fit that bill, but some of the ones I've seen are looking for people with Master's degrees.

7vzaru,Basic SQL for Day 2 Beginners - Joins,"Welcome back! If you haven't yet reviewed [Introduction to Basic SQL for Day 1 Beginners](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/7vs2ql/introduction_to_basic_sql_for_day_1_beginners/?ref=share&ref_source=link) then I encourage you to do so before continuing. This post covers the four primary join types and how they affect query output results. 

#Primary JOIN Types
To refresh, joins tie tables together based on common attributes. This allows us to retrieve information from both tables in our query results set.

&nbsp; 

**INNER JOIN**

* Return rows where a common entry exists in both tables
* If a row in either table cannot be joined to the other table, it will not be included in the results.

**LEFT JOIN**

* Return all rows from “left” table in the results
* The left table is the first table in the join sequence
* Only include rows in the “right” table if they have a common entry in the “left” table

**RIGHT JOIN**

* Return all rows from “right” table in the results
* The right table is the second table in the join sequence
* Only include rows in the “left” table if they have a common entry in the “right” table

**FULL JOIN**

* Return all rows from both tables even if a common entry does not exist in both

#Practical Join Examples

Consider the two example tables below and how each JOIN type affects our query results. These tables mimic the type of data you might encounter in a transactional sales database.

&nbsp;

**CUSTOMERS:**

CUSTOMER_ID | CUSTOMER_NAME
:- | :-
1 | Smoke Pit
2 | Don's Place
3 | RL Law Firm

**ORDERS:** 

ORDER_ID | CUSTOMER_ID | AMOUNT | DATE
:- | :- |:- |:-
1 | 1 | 50.00 | 01/05/2016
2 | 2 | 75.00 | 01/06/2016
3 | 1 | 63.00 | 02/05/2016
4 | 1 | 100.00 | 03/05/2016
5 | 2 | 10.00 | 04/01/2016
6 | 1 | 24.00 | 04/05/2016
7 | 4 | 99.00 | 04/07/2016

&nbsp;

##INNER JOIN##

**SQL Query:**

    SELECT A.CUSTOMER_ID, 
    A.CUSTOMER_NAME,
    B.ORDER_ID, 
    B.AMOUNT, 
    B.DATE 
    FROM CUSTOMERS A
    INNER JOIN ORDERS B
        ON A.CUSTOMER_ID = B.CUSTOMER_ID

**Results:**

CUSTOMER_ID | CUSTOMER_NAME | ORDER_ID | AMOUNT | DATE
:- | :- |:- |:- |:-
1 | Smoke Pit | 1 | 50.00 | 01/05/2016
1 | Smoke Pit | 3 | 63.00 | 02/05/2016
1 | Smoke Pit | 4 | 100.00 | 03/05/2016
1 | Smoke Pit | 6 | 24.00 | 04/05/2016
2 | Don's Place | 2 | 75.00 | 01/06/2016
2 | Don's Place | 5 | 10.00 | 04/01/2016

**Explanation:** An inner join would not include results for “RL Law Firm” because there are not any orders under that CUSTOMER_ID in the ORDERS table.

##LEFT JOIN##

**SQL Query:**

    SELECT A.CUSTOMER_ID, 
    A.CUSTOMER_NAME,
    B.ORDER_ID, 
    B.AMOUNT, 
    B.DATE 
    FROM CUSTOMERS A
    LEFT JOIN ORDERS B
        ON A.CUSTOMER_ID = B.CUSTOMER_ID

**Results:**

CUSTOMER_ID | CUSTOMER_NAME | ORDER_ID | AMOUNT | DATE
:- | :- |:- |:- |:-
1 | Smoke Pit | 1 | 50.00 | 01/05/2016
1 | Smoke Pit | 3 | 63.00 | 02/05/2016
1 | Smoke Pit | 4 | 100.00 | 03/05/2016
1 | Smoke Pit | 6 | 24.00 | 04/05/2016
2 | Don's Place | 2 | 75.00 | 01/06/2016
2 | Don's Place | 5 | 10.00 | 04/01/2016
3 | RL Law Firm |  |  | 

**Explanation:** A left join would include a row for “RL Law Firm” but would not have any corresponding data from the ORDERS table since there are no orders for that CUSTOMER_ID.

##RIGHT JOIN##

**SQL Query:**

    SELECT A.CUSTOMER_ID, 
    A.CUSTOMER_NAME,
    B.ORDER_ID, 
    B.AMOUNT, 
    B.DATE 
    FROM CUSTOMERS A
    RIGHT JOIN ORDERS B
        ON A.CUSTOMER_ID = B.CUSTOMER_ID

**Results:**

CUSTOMER_ID | CUSTOMER_NAME | ORDER_ID | AMOUNT | DATE
:- | :- |:- |:- |:-
1 | Smoke Pit | 1 | 50.00 | 01/05/2016
1 | Smoke Pit | 3 | 63.00 | 02/05/2016
1 | Smoke Pit | 4 | 100.00 | 03/05/2016
1 | Smoke Pit | 6 | 24.00 | 04/05/2016
2 | Don's Place | 2 | 75.00 | 01/06/2016
2 | Don's Place | 5 | 10.00 | 04/01/2016
  |  | 7 | 99.00 | 04/07/2016

**Explanation:** A right join would include a row for ORDER_ID = 7 but would not have any corresponding data from the CUSTOMERS table since there is not a CUSTOMER_ID = 4 in that table.

##FULL JOIN##

**SQL Query:**

    SELECT A.CUSTOMER_ID, 
    A.CUSTOMER_NAME,
    B.ORDER_ID, 
    B.AMOUNT, 
    B.DATE 
    FROM CUSTOMERS A
    FULL JOIN ORDERS B
        ON A.CUSTOMER_ID = B.CUSTOMER_ID

**Results:**

CUSTOMER_ID | CUSTOMER_NAME | ORDER_ID | AMOUNT | DATE
:- | :- |:- |:- |:-
1 | Smoke Pit | 1 | 50.00 | 01/05/2016
1 | Smoke Pit | 3 | 63.00 | 02/05/2016
1 | Smoke Pit | 4 | 100.00 | 03/05/2016
1 | Smoke Pit | 6 | 24.00 | 04/05/2016
2 | Don's Place | 2 | 75.00 | 01/06/2016
2 | Don's Place | 5 | 10.00 | 04/01/2016
3 | RL Law Firm |  |  | 
  |  | 7 | 99.00 | 04/07/2016

**Explanation:** A full join would include a row for “RL Law Firm” despite the fact that it has no ORDERS and a row for ORDER_ID = 7 even though CUSTOMER_ID = 4 does not exist in CUSTOMERS.",35,3,Oxford89,2018-02-07 20:49:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/7vzaru/basic_sql_for_day_2_beginners_joins/,0,learnsql

When I was working at my previous job, some queries were getting pretty big and ugly, and I started thinking about some kind of tool that could make building my SQL queries cleaner and more convenient. I thought that there must be a better way to organize queries other than in a wall of text.

Someone pointed to me that there were already some software like Alteryx and Knime that are visual, but for my objective (to just visually organize SQL queries) these were overkill and overbudget. Also, their dark theme is either non-existent or ugly as hell.

There are also other tools like Chartio's Visual SQL and Active Query Builder that are kinda ""visual"", but not the kind of visual that I wanted. So I decided to create my own.

Supports all modern browsers. Also supports tablets and IE11. Dark mode by default, light mode isn't even a consideration.

Don't know if it will be useful to you guys, but this would certainly be a game changer for my past self. I'll keep refining this project over time so feedback is much appreciated!",30,5,KyotaLangard,2021-06-29 17:31:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/oad1mn/i_built_a_free_online_tool_that_lets_you_visually/,0,learnsql
nk5ynd,SQL for beginners (easy),"Hi guys!

I write an open-source book about Data Engineering and recently posted a chapter about learning SQL from scratch.

I tried to make it as simple as possible, trying to avoid hard definitions and concepts. Because I remember learning SQL myself and all the struggles I had with it.

A note for experienced folks – I intentionally skipped a lot of hard topics because my idea is to learn as quickly as possible, so newcomers can write their first query right after reading first sections of the chapter.

Hope you will find it useful. Link to the chapter:

j12ylc,FREE Udemy Course on SQL with Real-World Exercises,"Fellow Data Geeks,

Here's a complete course on the fundamentals of SQL, that I'm offering for free on Udemy through the end of September:

https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-basics-crash-course-with-sql-server/?couponCode=LEARN-SQL-FOR-FREE

As a self-taught SQL programmer, I’ve learned the hard way that all the books, videos, and articles in the world won’t help without LOTS of structured practice, i.e. coding exercises. So I've included nearly 100 coding exercises in the course, covering every fundamental aspect of SQL programming.

And I walk through every subject in bite-sized videos ( averaging less than 10 minutes in length). Every concept is built up step by step, with no hand-waving at intermediate topics.

I hope you enjoy...and of course, reviews/feedback are greatly appreciated:)",29,5,TravisCuzick,2020-09-28 01:26:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/j12ylc/free_udemy_course_on_sql_with_realworld_exercises/,0,learnsql

1bhsr4d,Portfolio Project Idea,"Hi folks,

To many of you ask the same question over and over again. Putting together a portfolio project with no experience to very little experience is easier than you think and I'm going to give you an outline of how to impress employers! I'm not going to give you a detailed guide, because part of this journey and the real world is learning how to learn, learning how to research, and getting better at asking questions.

Therefore, you must be committed for 3 - 6 months depending on your knowledge and appetite to learn and experiment. Before we begin I want to be perfectly clear, **YOU MUST PRACTICE REGUARLY**. For those of you who are in a loop of courses, youtube videos, udemy, reading article after article, you will never get anywhere. **YOU MUST START PRACTICING**!

&#x200B;

**Portfolio Project**: All of this can be done for free without spending any money!

When I asked my manager if there's any big areas to be sure I know by the end of the week I was told to learn case statements as well as all of the types of joins (inner, left, right, outer) on top of union statements.

You can then update everyone participating for each day on what you did in that one hour, any learnings you have etc 

Its on another sub-reddit. You can be any level, doing work on any type of data you want. The goal is to push ourselves get 25 hours of practice in May. Looking forward to a month of querying :p

ql5slq,Frustrations when learning SQL,"When I was learning SQL I was often frustrated by a few things. **First, I wanted to learn more than just basic SQL syntax.** I wanted a database that I could write queries against, make mistakes, and learn by trial/error.  **Second, I didn't want to learn SQL with some online text editor.** I wanted to learn within a real database management system (DBMS). Half the battle when learning SQL is learning the DBMS. Learning a DBMS also allowed me to find my own data and build my own practice database. **Third, I wanted to practice with real data**. I wanted to solve questions that would be similar to real-world scenarios.

Years after learning SQL, I decided to provide a resource for students that share my same frustrations. Last month I published a SQL course and it has already helped hundreds of students. These students have given me great feedback and I continually add to the course to make it better. If you're interested then please message me or comment below and I will share the course link and a coupon code.

qe5chq,Walk me through a typical assignment as a data analyst who uses SQL,"Hello,

I am absolutely new to SQL, but am really interested in learning it. I’ve taken my first course and want to keep going. 

However, if it’s not too much to ask, I’d really like to gain insight as to what a typical task for a data analyst actually looks like.

Keep in mind, I really don’t have prior knowledge of how things work between the analyst and the employer, so be patient with me. You may think some of these questions are silly.

Specifically, I’m wondering:

How do you receive all of the data from whomever you’re analyzing data for?

Does your client or employer typically tell you what information or data they need analyzed?

How do you present or compile all of this data for your employer? 

What kind of data do you typically analyze, and do you go about it? Do you have to create tables for every variable that they might need (demographics, age, name information, etc.)? 

Sorry again if these are dumb questions!

7vs2ql,Introduction to Basic SQL for Day 1 Beginners,"#What is SQL?


Structured Query Language (SQL) is a computer language used for relational database management and data manipulation. It's mostly used to write “queries” to interact with data stored in tables. Tables are the the primary objects found within a database.

&nbsp;

#What is a Table?


A table is a collection of related data in a structured format. Tables consist of rows (records) and columns (fields, attributes). The data within a table is stored with different data types like strings, integers, and dates. Tables are uniquely named inside of a database. 

##Table Example

**CITY_CENSUS:**

CITY | STATE | POPULATION
:- | :- | :-
New York | New York | 8,550,405
Chicago | Illinois | 2,695,598
San Diego | California | 1,394,928
Austin | Texas | 931,830

&nbsp;

#Data Types


A data type defines the type of values that a column can contain. Once set, a column can **only** hold values of that particular type. Data types determine the disk space needed for storage as well as the speed at which that data can be retrieved. They are also important for data integrity. For example, we wouldn’t want letters in a field intended to hold timestamps.

##Basic Data Types

Data Type | Description | Example
:- | :- | :-
INTEGER | Whole numbers, no decimal values. | 10
VARCHAR | Variable length character. Allows letters, numbers, and many symbols. | John: $36
DATETIME | Stores date and time values. | 01/01/2017 12:00:00
DECIMAL | Decimal numbers. The scale, or number of decimal places, can be defined. | 99.20
BOOLEAN | Stores TRUE or FALSE values. In SQL Server, this is known as BIT (1 or 0). | TRUE

&nbsp;

#What is a Database?
A database is a collection of tables that can be related via common attributes. Like tables, databases also have unique names. Databases may also contain other objects, like “views” and “stored procedures”.

&nbsp;

#Querying Data
To view data stored within a table, we must query it. Querying is how we retrieve data stored inside of a database. Queries are like asking the database a question.

&nbsp;

**Question:** *What is the capital of New York?*

We can use the table below to easily find that the answer is *Albany*. But how would we write a SQL query to do that?

&nbsp;

**STATE_FACTS:**

STATE | COUNTRY | POPULATION | CAPITAL_CITY
:- | :- | :- | :-
New York | United States | 19,795,791 | Albany
Illinois | United States | 12,801,539 | Springfield
California | United States | 39,250,017 | Sacramento
Texas | United States | 27,862,596 | Austin

##Writing a SQL Query##

The syntax for writing a query is simple:


    SELECT [COLUMNS]
    FROM [TABLE]
    WHERE [CONDITION]

&nbsp;
	
* SELECT statement
 * What columns do we want to view in our output?
 * Use an asterisk (*) to return all columns
* FROM statement
 * What table is the information stored within?
* WHERE statement
 * What conditions do we want to specify of the data?
 * This statement is optional
 * Chain conditions using **AND** and **OR** operators
 * Isolate conditions using parantheses

&nbsp;

**SQL Query:** What is the capital of New York?

    SELECT CAPITAL_CITY, STATE
    FROM STATE_FACTS
    WHERE STATE = 'New York'

**Results:**

CAPITAL_CITY | STATE
:- | :-
Albany | New York

&nbsp;

#Querying Multiple Tables - SQL Join
The data we need is often stored across multiple tables. With SQL, that’s not a problem because we can easily JOIN tables together based on common attributes to retrieve information from both. 

##Joining Tables Together
Joins append columns from one table to another. The basic syntax is below.

    SELECT *
    FROM [TABLE 1] 
    JOIN [TABLE 2]
        ON [TABLE 1].[COLUMN A] = [TABLE 2].[COLUMN B]

&nbsp;

* JOIN Statement
 * What is the additional table you would like to query?
 * Must be accompanied by an ON statement
 * There are several different types of joins
* ON statement
 * What are the common attributes that are equivalent between the two tables?

##Aliasing
To make joins easier to write (and read), we can assign a working name to tables and columns. Table aliases can be used to replace the full table name when referencing columns in that table. Column aliases affect the column output name in query results.

    SELECT [T2].[COLUMN C] AS EXAMPLE
    FROM [TABLE 1] AS [T1]
    JOIN [TABLE 2] AS [T2]
        ON [T1].[COLUMN A] = [T2].[COLUMN B]

&nbsp;

* AS Statement
 * Follows the actual column or table name and immediately precedes the new alias name

##JOIN Example

**SQL Query:** How does each city's population in our earlier CITY_CENSUS table compare to their state's population from our STATE_FACTS table?

    SELECT CC.CITY, 
    CC.STATE, 
    CC.POPULATION AS CITY_POPULATION, 
    SF.POPULATION AS STATE_POPULATION
    FROM CITY_CENSUS AS CC
    INNER JOIN STATE_FACTS AS SF
        ON CC.STATE = SF.STATE

**Results:**

CITY | STATE | CITY_POPULATION | STATE_POPULATION
:- | :- | :- | :-
New York | New York | 8,550,405 | 19,795,791
Chicago | Illinois | 2,695,598 | 12,801,539
San Diego | California | 1,394,928 | 39,250,017
Austin | Texas | 931,830 | 27,862,596

od11qp,SQL Hands on Projects Recommendations,"Hi Guys,

I am a mechanical engineer but I managed to shift my career to some kind of a reporting specialist roughly 3 years ago and I want to be a Data Analyst.

Since I'm not working at the BI department, I don't have the authority to access the Datawarehouse via SQL (I asked they said it's not possible), I can only export reports to xlsx or csv files, and do my analysis by concatenating/manipulating them.

I generally write VBA to automate business tasks of my department and create dashboards with PowerBI (Comprehensive reports, mainly using DAX, some reports are fed by roughly 20 million rows via Powerquery).

I try to learn SQL by myself, but SQL courses are not like python courses, with python for instance you can go deeper and deeper with tutorials and hands-on experience. But with SQL every course teaches SELECT, UPDATE CREATE, JOIN, UNION etc. and stops there, I cannot find any course that goes really deep.

So, last week my dream came true and an HR Recruiter wrote me and asked if I was interested in a Data Analyst position, then we arranged a meeting, and when everything was going great, in the middle of the meeting, she asked me to if I was using SQL actively on my work, I said I don't but I'm trying to learn it by myself, and she was very disappointed like *""there is no point of proceeding meeting disappointed"".*

So my question is  I want to advance at SQL, so in the next meeting with another company, SQL wouldn't be the dealbreaker, but I believe I need to have tasks and projects and get my hands dirty but I can't find anywhere I'm lost.

My question is do you know any hands-on project course or a website that goes really really deep. Or do you have any other recommendations? Any suggestion would be much appreciated.",20,11,kkwestside,2021-07-03 16:14:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/od11qp/sql_hands_on_projects_recommendations/,0,learnsql

I got VS Code because I wanted to learn both SQL and Python, and it seems to support both. I still need to learn the program a bit more though.

Between MySQL and SQLite, I'm not sure which I should use. I saw MySQL being a bit more popular but I also saw SQLite might be easier to import a CSV with, so I just got both.

As for Azure Data Studio, I saw people recommending that since it is based off VS Code, but it looks to be for SQL only and I won't be able to do any Python off of it? If I should use Azure Data Studio instead, please let me know.

I eventually plan on getting PowerBI to practice with that, but I wanted to focus on SQL first.

My trouble right now is actually using my data in Excel to practice with. I learned how to use Python and SQLite3 to read an Excel File and run a query through it. This currently seems like the best way to practice right now, but I'm not happy with having to open the output file every time I want to see results.

    import sqlite3
    import pandas as pd
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    
    file = 'Budget 2021.xlsx'
    output = 'output.xlsx'
    
    engine = create_engine('sqlite://', echo=False)
    df = pd.read_excel(file, sheet_name='Transactions')
    df.to_sql('Finances', engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
    
    results = engine.execute(""Select * from Finances"")
    
    final = pd.DataFrame(results, columns=df.columns)
    final.to_excel(output, index=False)
    
    final
    
I also learned to create a database and table in MySQL through VS Code, and I learned to use LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE to get my CSV imported into the data. However, before I do this I need to open my CSV and add the Unique ID manually. I thought if I imported data, it would automatically do that. I set the key to auto increment when creating the table.

And then when I do, I would want to update this every week or so with my new data. However, the data would again be through Excel. And from what I understand, I'd have to delete all old data in the CSV before importing? 

So right now, here are my steps when I want to import data:

- Download an excel file off my Google Sheets
- Edit the data and save as a CSV
- Edit the dates to the right format (see below)
- LOAD DATA LOCAL to get the CSV into my file
- I can then start practicing SQL

OR

- Download an excel file off my Google Sheets
- Use the python script to immediately start practicing SQL. I just have to edit a certain part of the code each time.
- File gets saved as an excel file
- I have to open it each time I want to see results, and close/reopen when I want to make changes to the query. This is pretty slow as I'm constantly opening/closing Excel.

I feel like I'm doing all of this inefficiently and I would like to learn the best way before continuing. What is the best way for me to go about this? I am still in the learning phase so all of this is very new to me. 


And then a separate question I might as well throw in (related to the Dates issue above):

I created a table with a date column set as a date value. When I run the Python script to export into CSV, the date shows ""Fri Jan 01 2021 00:00:00 GMT -0800 (Pacific Standard Time)."" Is there a way to just make it the date? Like MM-DD-YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD? My data has date as MM-DD-YY so now when I import the data, all dates show 0000-00-00.",19,11,okawaiikoto,2022-08-30 19:13:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/x1rowe/trying_to_learn_sql_through_personal_data_ive/,0,learnsql

f89t9p,SQL EXERCISES ONLINE — TO MASTER YOUR SKILLS,"Structured Query Language or SQL is the backbone of data analytics and data science. SQL assumes data in the form of tables similar to spreadsheets. The language is based on relational algebra, which allows it to sort, filter, and recall data. The language has also undergone many modifications to add new functions and capabilities. This has caused SQL to evolve and branch into many different versions, each of them distinct but all based on the same relational mathematics that forms the skeleton of SQL.

**SQL in Data Analytics**  
SQL has assumed a position of industry standard within the field of Data Analytics. This is because the data structure considered within the program is a spreadsheet format, which has the most amount of applications in businesses. This is also because of the salient features of SQL, which make it easier to use for all.  
This has also resulted in SQL being an unavoidable skill for data analysts and developers. Basic SQL knowledge is now tested during the recruitment process of these jobs. SQL and Python problem solving, SQL Interview questions and SQL Exercises are given to aspirants in this sector to measure their proficiency in the language.

**SQL Proficiency Testing**  
As SQL has become an essential subject in the industry, the SQL proficiency of possible recruits is also being put to the test. All companies concerned with data science hire people who are well versed in SQL, among other things.  
 As it is with coding, tests are conducted by companies to measure the proficiency of possible recruits, and only those who do well are selected for the jobs. SQL exercises, interview questions and SQL problem-solving are the main methods used by these companies to choose the cream of the crop.

 **SQL Exercises**  
Practice results in perfection is a tried and tested principle. Since their early schooling of elementary mathematics, students have been encouraged to practice using the theoretical knowledge that they gain, not only to excel in the subject but also to improve problem-solving and analytical skills........

14g998x,SQL Learning Project: World Population Insights,"# Intro

Hi Everyone! While I was studying SQL online through courses, I realized there aren't many online that give you a project from start to finish. If this gets a lot of traction, I can definitely create more of these for different concepts!

This project uses sqlite and kaggle for the dataset.

It covers the following concepts:

* Basic [SELECT](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-select-statement/)
* [ORDER BY](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-order-by/)
* Basic [WHERE](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-where/)
* WHERE with [comparisons](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-operators/)
* aggregate [functions](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-aggregate-functions/)
* [GROUP BY](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-group-by/)

# Initial Set Up

Download the dataset (population.csv) [Available Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gyaswanth297/world-population-insights-1970-2022)

Open the csv file - let’s make a few modifications that will make this data easier to query.

1. Give the first column the name **Unique\_ID**
   1. Each column in a table should have a header.
2. For columns 2022 Population ->  1970 Population, change the name of the column to be like **Pop\_2022, Pop\_2020,** etc.
   1. Columns whose names start with numbers or include spaces require special syntax to query, so it’s better that column names start with letters and use underscores instead.
3. Change the Area column name to **Area\_km\_2** and the density column name to **Density\_per\_km\_2**
   1. Columns whose names have special characters can cause issues.
4. Change “Growth Rate” to **growth\_rate** and change “World Population Percentage” to **world\_pop\_percent**
   1. See note about spaces above.

Save (keep file format as csv)

Go to sqlite [https://sqliteonline.com/](https://sqliteonline.com/)

Hit **Import** on the top and import the population.csv file.

Change the **column name** option to select the **First Line**

Hit **Ok**

Now you should have the population table added to your database.

# Exploration

To see the columns that are included in the new table you just added, click on the carrot icon (<) next to the table name in the left-hand DB menu.

Here you will see the names of the columns as well as the type for each column. This will help you know what sort of data is available to query.

1. Write a query that returns all the data that is in the table.

Use this query to get more familiar with the data that is available to you and what it looks like. This will help you as you continue on.

wy48ta,Advice on exploring/ understanding / profiling a database with SQL?,"So I've got decent experience in relational databases via power bi and report building. But I'm starting to dive into SQL for one things and to better understand some of the databases that I work with. The hard part is my work has been TERRIBLE at documenting things like keys and schemas. So I end up diving in and searching for common keys and building joins and testing filters to get an understanding before moving back into power bi to build the actual report.

The hard part is that the database I'm working with has tables that can join in multiple ways, require a primary and secondary key to properly join (figured that out) and there's this one table I would love to pivot, but it's all non-numerical data and has around 58 possible headings that I have identified. So I can't agregate the data.

On top of that I've got duplicate measurements taken as a QC assurance system and only the first one is considered the valid result. I have yet to find the official flag marking that second result as a QC test. 

So what are some good methods to start profiling a database? And then starting to build filters, but verifying they're not dropping results I need. If I can get this figured out it will help a lot of my team members.",16,2,incendiary_bandit,2022-08-26 09:07:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/wy48ta/advice_on_exploring_understanding_profiling_a/,0,learnsql

9sfxnq,Understanding how SQL Subqueries Work Visually with Animated GIFs,"When I first started learning SQL, I had a fairly easy time grasping the basic concepts. But when introduced to the subquery, I had a hard time grasping the concept. I am more of a visual learner, and it was hard for me to visualize the concept of a query within a query. A colleague of mine put together a simple tutorial of the subquery that I found very helpful and thought I would pass along to anyone who may find it useful.

The tutorial visualizes a subquery with an interactive GIF that goes step by step through the query to the final result. What I found most useful is the GIF goes from the initial table, displays the subquery table, and then completes the final query. While the example problems are very basic, I found that visualizing the subquery table helped me a ton in understanding the steps between the main table and the final result. 

I have attached a link to the tutorial [here](https://dataschool.com/how-sql-subqueries-work/), and would love to hear if anyone finds this useful or has any comments regarding the tutorial!",16,1,None,2018-10-29 18:42:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/9sfxnq/understanding_how_sql_subqueries_work_visually/,0,learnsql

15lh4zb,How do you make a career out of SQL?,"I've made my way out of support, and finally have a job working with SQL!

To give some background, I started working at software companies w/o an IT or stem degree and got my foot in the door with application support roles (end user stuff) 

Then I was able to get a role on a team supporting already made Stored procedures, it was great!

Now I currently work on the implementation side of things, and I feel kind of stuck. 

My role involves mostly uploading new client data from excel spreadsheets to SQL. But I'm not really writing anything, it seems like the role just needs someone who knows enough SQL to figure it out if something breaks along the way.

I would like to advance in my career to the next step, I'm interested in continuing on the more technical route. I'm looking for some guidance on what I can look up, certifications, or anything to start studying to get to the next step.

I would like to get more technical, I just don't really know what to do from here. I also feel like my sql knowledge is stagnant as I'm not really writing or learning anything new. Any help is appreciated, and I'm more than happy to provide more context if needed.

TLDR: Current role involves a robust SQL script repository, I want to move to the next stage of my SQL career, if that's even a thing.",14,8,man8dude,2023-08-08 12:41:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/15lh4zb/how_do_you_make_a_career_out_of_sql/,0,learnsql

ztkj4p,Really struggling with simple SQL - Any advice?,"Hello! Does anyone like to teach? Or give advice? Or recommendations? I'm having a lot of trouble with the most basic of basic SQL queries. And second guessing if I am actually cut out for this. And looking for some help.

A little background. I have absolutely NO background in programing. Like, I didn't even know SQL existed. I come from a Psychology / Sociology background and like many people I am looking for a career shift. I am currently enrolled in Coursera's SQL for Data Science course and I am struggling hard. I feel like the course videos give the definitions and where to put them within the query but they do not give any examples of how to use them in practice. So when I get to the quizzes and tests, I am so lost on how to actually apply the concepts in these complicated word questions. 

Anyway, my questions are: 
1: Does anyone have any good resources or different courses that are geared towards absolute beginners? Books? Other courses? 
2: Did anyone else feel this same way about Coursera's Course? 
3: And any tips? 
4: How do you know when to use a subquery or what order? We very briefly touched on this subject in the course but it was more like ""you can use them sometimes, this is the formula"", but nothing about how to actually use them. I spent 2 hours trying and looking up how to answer a very simple (how many albums does a 'specific"" artist have?) and every answer to the quiz included 1 to 3 subqueries. I still don't quite understand how they came up with that solution.

I just feel lost and really second guessing if I fully understand this. I see others peoples ""beginner"" questions on reddit and feel like it is a foreign language as their questions are so complicated. I am struggling on simple SELECT statements let alone advanced techniques. I either have a long way to go to understand this or I should find a different career path.

yik33x,What is happening when I use HAVING on something that isn't an aggregate?,"As far as I understood, WHERE is for filtering rows and HAVING is used to filter an aggregate function. However, I'm confused about the results I'm getting when going back to a query I wrote before really understanding when each should be used: 

    SELECT labels, COUNT(labels) FROM reviews
    WHERE score > 9
    GROUP BY labels
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC; 

This gives me result which sums to 212 which is the correct number and these are the top results: 


Label | COUNT(*)
---|---
Rhino | 8
Hip-O Select | 8
Domino | 8
Matador | 7

However, if I leave out there WHERE and use HAVING on the score instead, the results are quite a lot different: 

    SELECT labels, COUNT(labels) FROM reviews
    GROUP BY labels
    HAVING score > 9
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC; 



Label | COUNT(*)
---|---
Warner Bros. | 132
Paw Tracks | 30
Columbia, Legacy | 16
Impulse! | 6

The sum of the count comes to 232 rather than 212. 

I guess the lesson is don't use HAVING on something that isn't an agg but I don't understand what is happening in the second query. I thought perhaps the HAVING is not actually doing anything but it is.",13,13,garamasala,2022-10-31 18:20:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/yik33x/what_is_happening_when_i_use_having_on_something/,0,learnsql
xatsfi,Question about SQL queries,"I've been grinding leetcode's and datalemur's SQL problems lately, but one thing I've noticed is how basic my queries compared to other submitted solutions. For instance, one of datalemur's hard problems goes as follows:

>Assume you have the table below containing information on Facebook user  actions. Write a query to obtain the active user retention in July 2022.  Output the month (in numerical format 1, 2, 3) and the number of  monthly active users (MAUs).

My thought process was:

1. I need to extract the month from event\_date
2. I need a count of users in July
3. I need to exclude the users that aren't in the month prior
4. Group by month
5. Done

My query was as follows:

    SELECT extract(month from event_date) as month, count(distinct user_id) ""monthly_active_users""
    FROM user_actions
    where event_date between '07/01/2022' and '07/31/2022'
    and user_id in (select user_id
                    from user_actions
                    where event_date between '06/01/2022' and '06/30/2022')
    group by month;

Which got me the desired output, but then looking at other solutions, some of them look really complex:

    select active_month as month, sum(case when active_month - prev_active_month = 1 then 1 else 0 end) as monthly_active_users
    from (select user_id, extract(month from event_date) as active_month , lag(extract(month from event_date))
    over (partition by user_id order by extract(month from event_date)) as prev_active_month
        from user_actions group by 1,2 ) as temp where active_month = 7 group by 1

The reason I ask is because I don't have a comp sci educational background, and as such I'm not well verse in the theory, what I know in SQL is stuff that I've picked up in my Support Engineer role. My question is, are my simple solutions inferior in any way to more complex queries?

So here is how the question was framed:

There is a table containing a list of authors, books, and the year the book was published. Here are a few sample rows:

|*Book*|*Author*|*Year Published*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|ABCDE|AC|1910|
|PQRST|BD|1950|
|STRWE|PT|1990|
|MORET|AC|1915|

18bkqdv,"I'm dipping my toes into SQL via code academy and I really like it so far, but I'm struggling to see how to apply SQL in my role.","I'm currently an accountant that is looking to develop more of a financial and operational analysis role at my company. As such I'm looking to try and pick up some technical skills that would help me with regards to data analytics. The most obvious skill being SQL. 

I'm really enjoying the programming aspect of it, at least the bare bones intro that CodeAcademy is providing me, and it's really fun to build a little table and recall specific information.

What I'm noticing is that SQL is providing me with ample means to filter through data to get specific subgroups of data, by identifying items with specific values or value filters on certain columns and all--which is awesome, but in my current role we use a ton of Excel to do data mining, clean-up and manipulation, so I guess I'm just failing to see how I will be able to implement SQL into my role as it currently stands. Am I able to use add-ons or tools to enhance my analysis and data manipulation through Excel, or would I be using SQL to likely design my own data bases? 

I think I'm just looking for some contextual, real life examples of how SQL would work in an accounting/financial analyst style of position so I can utilize and implement it into my current role.",13,16,Proper-Scallion-252,2023-12-05 19:58:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/18bkqdv/im_dipping_my_toes_into_sql_via_code_academy_and/,0,learnsql

Over time, I've learned that in order to go from SQL intermediate to SQL expert, I need to make my code more efficient, scalable, readable, and easier to debug. 

That's why I'm excited about [Ergest Xheblati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ergestxheblati/) free workshop this Thursday, [***SQL Patterns Every Analyst Should Know***](https://www.operationalanalytics.club/events/workshop-ergest-xheblati?utm_campaign=Parker%20Rogers%20-%20Organic%20Social%20Campaign&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_content=post-ergest-webinar). Ergest is the author of [*Minimum Viable SQL Patterns*](https://ergestx.gumroad.com/l/sqlpatterns), and he's been mastering SQL for 15+ years  


In his workshop, you'll learn about:

* **Query composition patterns -** How to make your complex queries shorter, more legible, and more performant
* **Query maintainability patterns -** Constructing CTEs that can be reused. In software engineering, it's called the DRY principle (don't repeat yourself)
* **Query robustness patterns -** Constructing queries that don't break when the underlying data changes in unpredictable ways
* **Query performance patterns -** Make your queries faster (and cheaper) regardless of specific database you’re using
* **Answers to your questions -** Ask Ergest whatever you'd like in the live and interactive Q&A

Hi,

I am a rising college sophomore who plans on heading into a data science career path and has been practicing SQL (mainly mySQL and Postgre) since the beginning of this summer.

I am now considering browsing through posts on this thread and Stack overflow and work on problems posted by real people to solve them, but I suddenly realized that I have never even laid a hand on real dataset and SQL IDE (if something like this exists for SQL as in for Java and Python?)  through which I can just create my own table and work on them as I wish.

tldr: where can I download/find a SQL IDE (preferably for mySQL and Postgre if that makes any difference) that allows customized tables and manipulations on these tables. **ALSO,** I would really appreciate some general guidance on what I am supposed to do next to improve my SQL learning journey or set myself up on the data science career.

e1kbcl,Microsoft Accreditation and learning SQL,"Hi, 

I'm looking to learn SQL as i'm looking to increase my career path and prospects. I currently work in a library. I'm happy to learn using free resources etc to a point but my worry is that since I'm not working with SQL at the moment I can't go to potential employers without some form of accreditation or qualification. 

&#x200B;

My questions are, is it worth doing free online courses before tackling a Microsoft accredited one; and also where do you recommend to do a Microsoft course? Online throws up a bunch of names of people who offer it, I'm assuming that you can go direct to Microsoft and pay them etc? I'm in the UK if that matters.

It's a series of almost 70 videos covering a range of topics in SQL:

* Introduction and Setup
* Viewing Data with SELECT
* More Operators
* Sorting Data
* Set Operators
* Aggregate Functions and Grouping
* Joins and Aliases
* Functions
* Subqueries
* Inserting, Updating, and Deleting Data
* Creating, Altering, and Dropping Tables

You can watch all of the videos here:

1alvow0,Boss is suggesting a query that i think is not efficient?,"we have a table that has id(PK),  product\_id(FK), product\_date...etc columns.  
there are 5k unique product\_id in another table.  


The requirement is to fetch from table 1 for a given date(This date vary for each product\_id).  
My current approach is, looping through the 5k product\_id one by one and running a select query  
\`select \* from table1 where product\_id = 'X' and product\_date>='Y'\`  
I know this leads to making 5k queries to DB  


My boss suggested something like this:  
make a single query like  
\`select \* from table1 where (product\_id = 'A' and product\_date>='B') or (product\_id = 'C' and product\_date>='D') or (product\_id = 'E' and product\_date>='F')......etc\`  


so this query will have 1000s of where conditions, but it will be a single query.  
keep in mind the table1 has more than 10 columns.  


I'm new to the job and i don't want to disagree with my boss on my first task. is his approach the correct way?  
PS: the query will be made via python code so constructing the query string with 1000s of lines is not a problem.

10wx840,Automating SQL queries and outputting to excel,"Hello,

Recently two of our database team left the company at short notice and I've been drafted in to help with some of their tasks.  I know basic SQL and have been tasked with running ""daily reports"" on certain databases that contain sales data that need sending out to clients.

The procedure is as follows:

There are 19 databases that I need to connect to.

I connect to the first one, load a stored procedure, update the date range from the previous value to a new value, and hit ""run"".

That outputs the information into the grid at the bottom, and I have to copy that and paste it into an excel document.

Repeated 18 more times.

I have 4 reports that are like this and it takes a very long time.

I am looking for a way to automate this.  The commands are simple SELECT froms, there's no changing of data.

At the end, I have very long rows of excel which I then format and add to a great big master sheet which is then sent off to the stakeholders.

I'm 99.9% certain this can be automated.

We use MSSQL 2014 on windows 2012 servers (soon to be upgraded as that's at end of life).

Is this something that can be done via PowerShell?  I know MSSQL can output to excel and I'm thinking maybe automate the SQL bit and then have a macro in excel that combines all the outputted files into one big one which can then be easily copy and pasted as needed?

And if so, are there any sites with templates or explanations that I could modify to do this?  I'm not very good with PowerShell.

Or would one giant stored procedure to cover all these tasks work without any PowerShell?

Basically I want to save a couple of hours a day so I can work on actual issues instead of crunching numbers for someone else.  

Any help greatly appreciated.",11,20,ElevensesAreSilly,2023-02-08 13:52:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/10wx840/automating_sql_queries_and_outputting_to_excel/,0,learnsql

wb14mq,INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... fails,"Hi,

I ran into a bit of an issue.

I have a Select query that runs fine and returns the expected results, but throws MySQL Error #1242 Subquery returns more than 1 row when used in Conjunction as part of an INSERT INTO query.

How do I go about troubleshooting this?

The query is structured like this:

    INSERT INTO....
        SELECT
            ...
        FROM (
            SELECT ...
            UNION
            SELECT ...
            UNION
            SELECT ...
        ) AS TMP
        INNER JOIN (
            SELECT ...
        ) DPS 

There are no subqueries in any columns for any of the involved SELECTs, which would be what I expect to cause this error. Since all subselects are used to generate temporary tables used in joins, they are expected to return multiple rows. 

The full query, that is part of a stored procedure, can be found here:
https://pastebin.com/4nh8Mqxs

EDIT:
I managed to find what caused the issue.
There was a duplicate row in one of the joined tables. 
This duplicate caused a conflict due to the UNIQUE Constraint on the Table the data is inserted into, so removing it fixed my problem.

rq533g,Questions on OUTER JOIN,"I've been trying to learn SQL this past week, and been going through SQLBolts tutorial and I have some questions on how OUTER JOIN commands (LEFT join, Right join, and FULL join) work. I understand LEFT and RIGHT JOIN return all rows from one of two tables  (not sure how to tell which table it will return rows from) and then for the other table will only return rows matching a criteria you set with the ON command that overlaps with the other table usually a primary key. What I'm confused about is how where, select, and from statements affect JOIN commands.

 E.g If you do Select \* FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table 2 ON table1.column1 = table2.column2 

Will you return a table with every single row from table 1 or will you return every single row from table2? And is this the same for using RIGHT JOIN as well? 

Also with ON statement does it make it so that anything you do to the attribute from table 1 (column1) affects the attribute from table 2 (column2) or does it just allow you to access attributes connected column1 and column2. Like lets say column1 was primary key like student ID's and column2 was also student ID but table 1 had class schedules of students and table 2 had living information about those students how does the USE of ON as well as statements like from, select, and where affect this?",12,7,asapMuk,2021-12-28 03:08:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/rq533g/questions_on_outer_join/,0,learnsql

-I downloaded and use a sample SQL database called AdventureWorks: https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/adventure-works

-I then use a sql testing software from RedGate but don't understand these tests they made for me: https://github.com/red-gate/SQLCop

I have seen alot of flavors of SQL like Microsoft, Oracle etc. I am using Udemy to get a taste of SQL. I am not a developer or programmer. I am looking to add a skill of SQL to get a better job. Upon reading various articles it appears depending on the SQL platform is what Syntax dialect needed to learn. What is the stepping stone of SQL I should start to enter the SQL job market? Fellow Reddit help suggested: Generally though, if you know one SQL variant learning what the equivalent function in another one is just a simple google query away, the query logic remains basically the same. Unless you plan venturing into the world of database development, using a procedural language like PL/SQL (Oracle) or T-SQL (SQL Server), you need not to worry about it. The most important thing about learning SQL is not in syntax, which is rather trivial, but the fact you're working with sets of data, which a lot of people have trouble with, especially those with background in procedural programming.
I recommend http://sqlzoo.net to get started, you get exercises you need to complete, quizzes, what not. It walks you through all basic SQL features. I think if you're looking for a database administration position, then yes certifications can help. But if you're doing more data analysis/BI I don't think the certifications matter (although I think Microsoft has an intro cert for basic SQL stuff: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/course.aspx?cid=40364).

For reddit web it looks like trash, [here's a link to the old reddit version that looks better imo](https://old.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/15yxqds/database_theory_learning_resources_for_the/) 

So the sticked post talks about theoretical resources but I thought I'd add more.

I'm currently going through learning relational database theory as I'm particularly neurotic. I've always prefered the school approach, which I know is kinda rare to say online as I think most people would rather just know how to use the tool instead of how the tool works. I'm not a CS grad and have never taken a formal databases CS course. So as someone like that, which course would I learn from if I was to pick one?

I know the Widom combination of Stanford Edx course and book combination are oft-touted and for good reason they are solid.

Another one that's often talked about and is TOTALLY WORTH IT, I've gone through all of it and would definitely recommend: [https://a.co/d/fETI2qF](https://a.co/d/fETI2qF) (Manga Guide to Databases). Not a joke even if it seems like it initially.

IF however like me you like to really look into the marketplace and see what else is out there, I hope this post helps you for that. What books should I use? What do the top schools use? This post is for you.

For example, while I liked Dr. Widom's lecture videos and material. I preferred using  CMU's 15 - 445.  They have a Discord, a public GradeScope to get your assignments graded and a Youtube Channel which I thought was pretty awesome.

Hopefully you can browse the links and pick a course that will help you on your learning journey!

# My Personal Learning Plan

I'm using a combination of CMU 15 - 445 lecture videos, Fundamentals of Database Systems and Database Systems Concepts. I'm using exams from CS4400 from GATech and CSE414 from UW listed above. Additionally, Database System Concepts has solutions for some of their problems. I read Fundamentals of Database Systems COncepts FIRST as I find it's longer, and then follow up with Database System Concepts at the end for the practice problems. DSC is for sure shorter on average than FoDS. I'm going through Physical Implementation right now so I'm probably at the 40% mark of how much I want done.

Additionally since too much theory sometimes makes me feel lost in the sauce I try to temper it with actual implementations. Like the Postgres Internals book [https://www.interdb.jp/pg/](https://www.interdb.jp/pg/) or different Query Optimizers [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjYPyrUG\_YxqYPS7wjWY6gYN](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjYPyrUG_YxqYPS7wjWY6gYN) or SQL Server docs [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/query-processing-architecture-guide?view=sql-server-ver16](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/query-processing-architecture-guide?view=sql-server-ver16)

To each their own study plan but this is what I decided to go with after some deliberation. I'm already over a month into it so I'm committed at this point, got over the analysis paralysis and buyers remorse of if there's better or worse ways to learn this. Will this help me in my job search? Probably not. Could I use my time to learn better skills to advance in my job? Absolutely. I'm never going to be implementing DBMS software myself. But again I'm a pretty obsessive dude and want to understand to SOME LEVEL some of the underlying technology otherwise I feel like I'm just a SQL monkey and nothing more.

# Other Notes

Some other stuff I had booked marked so far

I was still puzzled about Agg Functions after going through the Relational Algebra material so was definitely was googling around for explanations. Nothing exhaustive but some of the papers mention that's by design.

would probably have to look at Query plans for agg functions to try and understand

wtctwl,"Is there a way to fetch first rows having an IDs from a list of IDs, fetched with select from other table on the same query?","Hello fellow Redditors!

I struggle to retrieve data with one request from two tables.

The first table holds a number of IDs, which are fetched with simple ""SELECT id from table where name = 'something' "". With this I get a selection of 8 IDs out of thousands.

The next step is I need to fetch a first random row with those selected IDs from second ""transactions"" table. It's 75gb table, and I don't need to run through the whole table. I just need to get an account from fetched ID for the 8 IDs I got. 

I tried to make a select inside a select, but I got it run through the whole table. I tried to use first() function and it retrieves only first ID-account pair, not 8. The distinct() function get me all rows with first ID.

Is it even possible to achieve?

I'm working on evaluation of a new teaching method at a college.  We are collecting student demographics and academic data from the university each semester and we are doing in-class surveys and content quizzes at the beginning and end of each semester.  So far, we have about 12 datasets and that will increase by 3 each semester.  We will also likely pull more historical data for comparison. We need to analyze how the classes with the new teaching methods are influencing student achievement. 

So, given we have many relational datasets across students and courses, would SQL be useful for managing the data? So far I'm going through complex merging acrobatics every time I need to run a different analysis.

lgg8ng,SQL interview question prep- AirBnb- Medium level,"&#x200B;

I have recently started to practice  SQL questions and often face some doubts. For this below question.

https://preview.redd.it/skam06djbjg61.png?width=1606&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e4c0f9214ce139cd916e95f718eabf0e1f5daa2

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wrote the below code and gives the wrong output.

< SELECT  100.0 \* ((SUM(CASE

WHEN ts\_accepted\_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1

ELSE 0

END))/(SUM(CASE

WHEN ts\_contact\_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1

ELSE 0

END))) AS acceptance\_rate

FROM airbnb\_contacts />

&#x200B;

While the below code works fine (official solution given on website)

<SELECT 100.0\*SUM(CASE

WHEN ts\_accepted\_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1

ELSE 0

END)/COUNT(\*) acceptance\_rate

FROM airbnb\_contacts/>

&#x200B;

Can anyone please help me understand why the first code gives wrong output. My understanding is there is something wrong in 2nd SUM statement of first code, which I am using to count the total number of records where contact is given, as the question asks for the ratio of accepted vs all contacts.

While in the 2nd code, they have simple taken the count of all records in the table using COUNT(\*). Please help me understand what I am missing.",11,7,Ill-Tip3736,2021-02-09 23:17:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/lgg8ng/sql_interview_question_prep_airbnb_medium_level/,0,learnsql

j3sm2t,What would cause a SQL query to be so slow returning results?,"HI everyone, 

Just looking for some advice as to what might be causing a SQL query to return results so slowly?

For background, the SQL database is on Azure (200 DTUs, 18% filled). It's filled with data from two nursing homes. 

To filter the data down to times a call has been made for help from client to nurse is using a where clause of 'where STATUS IS NOT NULL'. I have created a view for this and this can take between 10-15 minutes to return a result however if I add a parameter to just return results of Top 1000 for nursing home A - it will return in approx 8 seconds. The same query with nursing home B will take 10-15 minutes - so the issue would seem to be with nursing home B. 

I don't believe there to be any differences between the two systems relaying the data back to the database. 

Is there something you would recommend doing to find the cause of the delay?

This is a test project so problems were expected but is this a common issue with Azure? We could return 100,000 rows from a view or query from our local SQL database - so I am just looking for a few ideas to understand why I might have encountered these issues. 

Thank you  😃",12,14,None,2020-10-02 11:12:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/j3sm2t/what_would_cause_a_sql_query_to_be_so_slow/,0,learnsql

13re144,Getting back to learning SQL with a small project.,"Hey there! So here's my deal. I recently graduated a computer science university. Sadly due to some poor life choices and economic reasons it did take me a good while to finish. But now that it's over and i don't have that pressure looming over me I thought it would be a good time to focus on what I really liked. Namely databases, programming and the like. 
I wouldn't call myself a beginner but I do need to brush up on a lot of things.
I came up with an idea for a small project that would basically have me make a small database of old hardware in my house. For example I recently boxed an old graphics card. So I thought I'd give that box a name and related info and do the same for all my PC stuff. 
The end goal is to produce a small database that I can always update, and that would have some sort of interface for me to type in key words and return the box that item had been placed in. 
My main question here is do you guys think a project is the way to go? Some alumni told me to start by doing the exercises from our old Lab assignments. And those are fine to brush up on things. But a project sounds more appealing to me. Gives you the chance to play around a bit right? Heck I guess I could even put that thing in a portfolio if it turns out any good.
Final question. How do I go about doing something like this? I'm not asking for code of course. But is it possible to do this with a program like MySQL?

12ft0km,I have a table of products that can be renamed each year. I want to group the products even when they have changed names. What is the best way to do this. Should I create a foreign key that refers to the same table?,"In the below example, we get 3 products named ""Addr1"" through ""Addr3"" in the year 2022.  In the year 2023, product ""Addr1"" changes its name to ""Addr4"".  Because of this, I have inserted a foreign key named ""parent_id"" in ""Addr4"" for 2023 that references the old product name, ""Addr1"" from 2022 (which has an id of 1 due to autoincrement--I probably should have specified this explicitly).  

I want to sum the ""amount"" field by the unique ""product_code"" records--but group and records that have changed ""product_code"" values with their parents.

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
    	   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    	   product_code VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    	   year INTEGER NOT NULL,
    	   amount INTEGER NOT NULL,
    	   parent_id INTEGER,
    	   FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES products(id)
    );
    
    DELETE FROM products;
    
    INSERT INTO products (product_code, year, amount, parent_id) VALUES
      ('Addr1', 2022, 1000, 0),
      ('Addr2', 2022, 1000, 0),
      ('Addr3', 2022, 1000, 0),
      ('Addr4', 2023, 1000, 1),
      ('Addr2', 2023, 1000, 0),
      ('Addr3', 2023, 1000, 0),
      ('Addr4', 2024, 1000, 0),  -- should this product_id (fk) also be 1, referring to ""Addr1"" in 2022, similar to 2023?
      ('Addr2', 2024, 1000, 0),
      ('Addr3', 2024, 1000, 0);
      
     SELECT * FROM products;    


The result that I am expecting would be the following:

    +--------------+--------------+
    | product_code | total_amount |
    +--------------+--------------+
    | Addr4        |         3000 |
    | Addr2        |         3000 |
    | Addr3        |         3000 |
    +--------------+--------------+
    
Questions include:

- Is a foreign key that refers to the id column in this same table the best way to handle a change in ""product_code""?  

- When would it make sense to create a separate table to track the changes values in the the ""product_code""?

- How do I generate a query that sums amounts for all records based on product_code but groups any records that have changed their product_code values with their original ""parent"" records?

- If product_code ""Addr4"" changed its name to ""Addr5"" in 2025, how would you write the query?  

- [EDIT] A problem that I'm also running into is that a product_code in 2022 can split into several products in, say, 2023, but then in 2024 could potentially unsplit (combine) into a new product_code.

120jpay,Is it OK to perform extra backend operations while locking the table?,"Hello,

I've never used transactions or locks before, but I think in my case I had to use it now.

This is the situation: I need to `SELECT` codes from the `codes` table, then `INSERT` them to `Table2`, but I have to make sure that no other users insert the same codes from `codes` into `Table2`.

The problem is that the codes aren't a unique column, so the same user can insert multiple rows with the same code, but only at the same request.

But before I insert the codes to `Table2`, I prepare the array result from the `SELECT` query to the insert.

What I do is I get the result into an array, then I add the data (Table2 columns) to the array, then I insert:

""Pseudo"" code:

    Begin Transaction;
    
    $codes_array = // SELECT codes from codes table WITH (HOLDLOCK, UPDLOCK)
    
    // Now add extra data to the above array in my backend (PHP):
    $data_to_insert = [];
    foreach ($codes as $code) {
      $data_to_insert[] = [
        ""code"" => $code,
        ""some_column"" => ""some_data"",
      ]
    }
    
    INSERT $data_to_insert to Table2
    
    Commit Transaction;

So I select the codes with `(UPDLOCK, HOLDLOCK)` so no one else can select codes at this time, then append extra data then insert to Table2.

&#x200B;

Is it OK to do that? The PHP foreach loop takes really really short time, but still I wonder if that's something OK to do, i.e. to hold the table locked for backend operations and not just other SQL operations

&#x200B;

Also in my case, is there a risk for a dead lock? I didn't think so but again, it's the first time I use it

ygq621,How to progress learning SQL? HackerRank and PGExercises get too hard too fast.,"I started learning Python for data analysis earlier this year with the hopes of transitioning my career, and I have just started learning SQL around the beginning of October. Starting out, I watched the 3-hour SQL video by Programming with Mosh and felt really comfortable with the things I was learning. After that, I tried out SQLZoo until it broke on me (keep getting errors no matter what is submitted). I saw a lot of people saying HackerRank and PGExercises provided good practice problems so I moved onto those. Starting out they were very easy, but quickly evolved past what I could work out myself. Subqueries started getting confusing and convoluted. Window functions seemed easy enough when following a tutorial, but problems immediately required using CASE statements inside of subqueries inside of window functions! 

I wouldn't mind paying for a course if it would *actually* help me, but I'm afraid that they are going to be too easy to the point where I still can't figure out solutions to more difficult problems. I've taken a few free courses when learning Python and they were terribly simple and didn't really ""teach"" (they just provided code, you changed a few words and hit submit). I have the book *Learning SQL* by Alan Beaulieu. Should I be starting with that? I read a similar book for Python and I never refer back to it. I always prefer learning from documentation and examples, so I'm worried this book will be just as useless to me.",10,8,Exquisite_Poupon,2022-10-29 17:54:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/ygq621/how_to_progress_learning_sql_hackerrank_and/,0,learnsql

okyy6e,"Coursera's ""SQL for Data Science"" questions","Has anyone else taken this course, and do you think it's as painful as I do?

I've taken probably 6 courses through Coursera and my experience has been by-and-large positive. But this course is god awful and I can't tell if it's me or the subject matter. Generally speaking it:

* Covers topics in passing and expects you to internalize that topic
* Provides no slides to review which, given the first bullet, is almost required
* The instructor (at least this first one) is evidently reading from cards and she's not a great reader. Frequently tripping over words, or finishing a sentence only to realize there are three more words. 
* There's a ton of mini-quizes which is fine, but it also has a ""check all the right answers"" which is both wildly pedantic and in many instances neither provable or educational

I'm muscling through this course because the advice I was given on r/learnpython was that SQL is going to be required for the career path I want, but I'm struggling with this course, and I'm hoping to hear from others who've taken it.

mrflgj,Introducing lexiQL: SQL visualizer and GraphQL prototyping tool,"Hey r/learnSQL! Learning SQL is difficult and can be hard to grasp. Want to make it more tangible by visualizing your SQL database? Looking to migrate away from a RESTful API architecture to GraphQL? Then we've got good news for you!

[lexiQL](https://www.lexiql.io/) is the newest **open-source** dev tool designed to ease the transition from RESTful APIs to GraphQL. Input a PostgreSQL database link (or use our sample database) and lexiQL will generate the associated GraphQL schema, including Types and Resolvers.

Alongside this **GraphQL boilerplate**, lexiQL aims to help developers visualize their data with an **interactive GUI** that displays all of the tables in a relational database, including primary/foreign key relationships between tables, as well as each table’s columns and associated data types.

Read more about us on [Medium](https://ryan-mcdaniel.medium.com/introducing-lexiql-56401bbf8d9e) and check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/lexiQL)! lexiQL is a new tool that remains in active development.

So from the title the company wants an SQLite database as the final submission and I'm wondering how big of a difference mySQL and SQLite are?

Should I just start over and look for a SQLite course or are the differences minor (just syntax)? Also would it be worth asking if could submit a mySQL database or is the difference so large that it wouldn't be acceptable?",9,0,Bikrant,2019-10-13 00:50:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/dh3mrx/started_a_mysql_online_course_for_a_internship/,0,learnsql

c98k0l,Would appreciate some pointers and feedback about the database I designed for my full stack ecommerce project!,"I am creating an ecommerce platform similar to Etsy for my full stack portfolio.

Users will be able to ...

\- Create listings

\- Leave feedback to for an item of a user

\- Save or ""like"" listings so they may refer to it for possible future purchase

I would like advice specifically on my many to many relationship tables for selling\_items, user\_item\_feedback, and liked\_items.

Will  everything work out smoothly when querying for these tables if users on  the front end want to check saved items, feedback, and items for sale  based on user\_id?

Anything I've missed or feedback that might make this database better would be highly appreciated.

The question is  list  all employees that had worked as a ""SALES REPRESENTATIVE"" 	previously (not including the current job).

&#x200B;

Answer that she gave us was

&#x200B;

\[code language=""css""\]

    SELECT employees.employee_id, employees.first_name, employees.job_id as current_job, job_history.job_id as previous_job
        FROM employees, job_history, jobs
            where employees.employee_id = job_history.employee_id  AND
                employees.job_id = jobs.job_id  AND 
                jobs.job_title = 'Sales Representative';

\[/code\]

\`

&#x200B;

I feel that she had it wrong. With her solution seem like it will select whoever that current work as  'Sales Representative' and previous work as  'Sales Representative'. She insist we shouldn't use the job\_id from both the job\_history table and employees table since the question constraint was job\_title. I try run her code with a sample data and get the answer which include whoever that current or previously work as ""Sales representative"".

Below is my solution

&#x200B;

\[code language=""css""\]

    select employees.employee_id, employees.job_id , job_history.job_id
        from employees, job_history
        where employees.employee_id = job_history.employee_id AND
                employees.job_id <> 'SA_REP' AND
                job_history.job_id = 'SA_REP';

\[/code\]

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Please tell me that she actually wrong about this or correct me. It really bother me

The question: ""Find the ___ rate by customer who is active"". 

Two tables:

1. JOIN tables via primary key
2. WHERE to filter for customers who are: active
3. GROUP BY x,y
4. Calculate rate within SELECT

I failed at writing the query. I aggregated on the wrong variable and GROUP BY x, not 'x' and 'y'.

When I got home, I could answer the question, no problem.

What do other people do to help them prepare for SQL interviews that require using the whiteboard?

1ase8t7,Is this normal?,"I am very new to SQL, I have done some tutorials and understand most of the concepts used, but have 0 working experience and can have a hard time understanding complex SQL.

Unfortunately, I don't even know which variant of SQL this is, I can't share it (work) and, no one in the org seems to know what it is.

We've had several managers who are not tech-savvy in charge of the SQL, and there are comments in the code from like 2014. The code is insanely complex, if you were to print it from Word it would be 50 pages.

It is a shipping report from an ERP with nothing special in it, only 3 parameters to select from. 

Is it normal for code for a report like this to be that long? It is also very complex, But with my limited knowledge, it is just recreating versions of the table depending on different situations and handling errors accordingly.

The report does not include the foreign key we would need to be able to utilize the data properly. My idea so far is to comb through it line by line and insert a line adding the column wherever the PK shows up, and asking if we can somehow test it without breaking anything. Is this reasonable or a horrible plan with tangled-up legacy code?

I know the table I want to pull from, I know it is included in the current mess, and can see the joins. I just don't know if this is a huge waste of time.",9,8,MaintenanceCurrent44,2024-02-16 17:26:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/1ase8t7/is_this_normal/,0,learnsql

167xbrw,Why do I get ridiculous results when the lines of code are super simple?,"Hi all!

I recently started learning SQL and I'm following a popular YT tutorial to create a project (and possibly a piece of portfolio). The Excel file I'm using has data on Covid cases, deaths, countries, etc.

The thing is, I'm typing (what I think is) a very simple query to find the countries with the highest infection rate. The lines of code run, but the numbers in the result panel look ridiculous to me. I get a percentage of over 70% for some countries.

https://preview.redd.it/0s188ka51tlb1.png?width=1447&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e5643e2c6ec380ef81abb08e411be8f9674b5ff

If I do the math by myself, let's say for Cyprus (the first country in the results panel), it would be something like this:

(999/896007)\*100 = 0.111%

SO the first row on the PercentageOfCases should be 0.111, not 73.755, which is a ridiculous number.

Can someone please explain to me why is this happening? I basically just copied and pasted the code to make sure I didn't make a mistake but I still get the same results. I even closed and opened again SQL, but nothing.

As I'm new I would appreaciate any advice. Thanks!

EDIT:

Thank you all for your responses! It makes me happy to know that I can count on some nice internet strangers while learning ina field where I'm not very knowledgeable. But back to the problem.

I went back to the excel file to dig into the numbers and make sure I was doing reasonable math. I realized that, the numbers in the SQL results for total cases where wrong and as someone already said in the comments (thanks Waremi), the total cases were the wrong data type. Which is why  (999/896007)\*100 = 0.111% didn't make sense.

When I changed total cases to integer, the numbers changed and the math made a lot of sense. Here's a screenshot:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8ujo36b673mb1.png?width=1474&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c3e32a70aca5ec3f83b457bfc0dcccd55d5ca0a

Aaaaand, here's the code:

Select location, population, max(cast(total\_cases as int)) as HighestCasesCount, max((total\_cases/population))\*100 as PercentageOfCases

from ProjectPortfolio..CovidDeaths$

where continent is not null

group by location, population

order by PercentageOfCases desc

&#x200B;

So, it's not

(999/896007)\*100 = 0.111%

The correct math is actually

(660854/896007)\*100 = 73.755%

which matches the SQL results. And the explanation as to why such a big percentage... well I typed the explanation on the screenshot.

If someone has more feedback for me I would appreciate it. Thank you again!

11hc08u,Any difference between how data is stored on sql systems vs simple text files?,"I was just wondering if there's any difference in the way data is stored on disk by any of the big sql systems and a simple text file.

    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

Do they take up the same amount of disk space, or does one come with significantly more overhead? Do big advanced sql systems compress data on disk so it takes less space than a txt file would take?

10q1x2h,Having trouble with subqueries,"I'm a Product manager with a good understanding of SQL, but this is beyond my knowledge and I haven't found anything online explaining what I can do.

I have two tables that I want to join but have different structures. I've tried using subqueries, left joins with the first table as the primary subject, CASE WHEN, and EXISTS. I'm on an enterprise database for work using DBeaver. I don't think I have any write privileges, but even if I did, I don't want to get into creating tables. Hoping someone can help with insight in how to flatten the data out in a meaningful way. 

The first table is a basic data structure where each attribute has its own column and each ID value shows up once. For example.

|ID|Fruit Name|Fruit Color|Fruit Size (g)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|abc|Apple|Red|175|
|def|Orange|Orange|210|
|ghi|Grape|Green|40|
|jkl|Banana|Yellow|125|

Then, the second table is in a structure where each attribute has its own record and ID values repeat.

|ID|Attribute Name|Attribute Value|
|:-|:-|:-|
|abc|Fruit Name|Apple|
|abc|Fruit Family|Rosaceae|
|abc|Fruit Holder|Alice|
|def|Fruit Name|Orange|
|def|Fruit Holder|Bob|
|ghi|Fruit Name|Grape|
|ghi|Fruit Family|Vitaceae|
|jkl|Fruit Name|Banana|
|jkl|Fruit Holder|Carol|
||||

Is it possible to flatten this table out and join it to the first table? In practice, each ID value has a set of 70+ attributes, but not the same set of 70+ attributes. Further, not every record will have the ""Fruit Family"" name.

&#x200B;

I'd like to append the ""Fruit Family"" name onto the first table where available. Something like this.

|ID|Fruit Name|Fruit Color|Fruit Size (g)|Fruit Family (Joined)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|abc|Apple|Red|175|Rosaceae|
|def|Orange|Orange|210|Not Available|
|ghi|Grape|Green|40|Vitaceae|
|jkl|Banana|Yellow|125|Not available|

yrmlko,Need help adding conditions to query,"Hello folks,

I'm very new to SQL, and I've been driving myself crazy trying to get the syntax right for this query. I'm trying to list the rents of all the properties my company owns for the current tenant and the previous tenant. I'm drawing from 2 tables here:

&#x200B;

|Property Key|Tenant Code|End Date|Rent|Status|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|p1|Tom|12/31/22|2,200|Current|
|P1|Tom|12/31/20|1,950|Current|
|P1|Dick|11/30/17|1,800|Non-Current|
|P1|Harry|10/31/16|1,600|Non-Current|
|P2|Larry|5/31/23|1,600|Current|
|P2|Curly|4/30/22|1,450|Non-Current|
|P3|Moe|6/30/23|2,300|Current|

&#x200B;

|Property Key|Property Code|
|:-|:-|
|P1|Y4|
|P2|Y5|
|P3|Y6|

Ideally, the output would look something like this:

&#x200B;

|Property Code|Current Rent|Previous Rent|Rent Growth|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Y4|2,200|1,800|22.2%|
|Y5|1,600|1,450|10.3%|
|Y6|2,300|\[NULL\]|\[ERR\]|

So the first row gives the current rent for Y4. Y4 corresponds to P1 in Table 1 and the current rent is the most recent Monthly Rent (2,200 from the 12/31/22 lease). The Previous Rent is 1,800 because the last tenant for P1 was Dick, not Tom or Harry, so even though there is a 12/31/20 lease, Tom is still the tenant so we have to look at Dick’s 11/30/17 lease and ignore Harry's 10/31/16 lease.

The second row gives the 1,600 and 1,450 from Larry and Curly’s lease for Y5 (P2).

The third row gives the current rent (2,300) but returns null since there were no previous tenants for Y6 (P3).

I also added a calculated column at the end that performs the operation \[Current Rent\] / \[Previous Rent\] – 1 to get the % change in rent from the last tenant to the current tenant.

To get here I have to do some selects for each column value:Col 1: Select p.Yardi\_Property\_Code

Col 2: Select Rent for the conditions (a) matches selected Property Code; (b) Tenant Status is “Current”; and (c)  max EndDate

Col 3: Select Rent for the conditions (a) matches selected Property Code; (b) Tenant Status is “non-Current”; and (c)  max EndDate

Col 4: Calc = \[Col 2\] / \[Col 3\] -1

I feel like there must be some nested selects or something that I’m not that familiar with to get to that point. Or the case function? Any ideas?",8,6,Hollopalooza,2022-11-10 17:52:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/yrmlko/need_help_adding_conditions_to_query/,0,learnsql

uatcy5,SQL Queries," Hey so i was practicing these SQL queries on Oracle but i cant get to understand and solve a few of them, if anyone can help me solve them id appreciate it a lot, also if you can explain your solution that would help

So these are a set of queries ,

=======================================================================================

1. Define cursor to count the number of employees in the following salary ranges:

· Below 1500

· Above 1500 but below 3000

· Above 3000 but below 5000

Display the count of each in a message.

2. Change the above using functions in such a way that only count of employees of user defined range should be displayed.

3. Write a function / procedure to update salary values of employees as:

Below 1500: 5% of their salary

Around 4000: 15% of their salary

7000 and above: 30% and above

4. Improve task no 3 so that number of rows updated should be displayed. Also display count of salary changed in each range.

5. Write a function / procedure to display number of employees working on particular post. Generate an error message if the user entered post does not exist.

=======================================================================================

Here is my solution of the first task :

DECLARE  
eno EMP.EMPNO%type;  
salary EMP.SAL%type;  
count1 int := 0;  
count2 int := 0;  
count3 int := 0;

cursor c\_1 is  
select empno, sal from emp;

BEGIN  
open c\_1;  
loop  
fetch c\_1 into eno,salary;  
IF salary <1500 then  
count1 := count1 + 1;  
ELSIF salary > 1500 AND salary < 3000 then  
count2 := count2 + 1;  
ELSIF salary > 3000 AND salary < 5000 then  
count3 := count3 + 1;  
END IF;  
EXIT WHEN c\_1%NOTFOUND;  
END LOOP;

dbms\_output.put\_line(count1 || ' counts are less than 1500 count ');  
dbms\_output.put\_line(count2 || ' counts are less than 3000 AND greater than 1500 '); dbms\_output.put\_line(count3 || ' counts are less than 5000 AND greater than 3000 ');

tjgdig,Table structure for Task Manager App,"Im designing an app for assigning tasks between departments, using a sql back end. 
The table ""Tasks"" has:
 
TaskId (PK)
Task
CompanyId (FK)
DepartmentAssign
CreateDate
CreateTime
OnHold (boolean)
Priority (boolean)
IsComplete (boolean)
CompleteDate
CompleteTime

When a task is assigned to a department, it appears on their end when they query 

SELECT * FROM Tasks WHERE CompanyId = ""1"" AND DepartmentAssign = ""Accounting"" AND IsComplete = ""False""

When they have finished, they simply flip the boolean on ""IsComplete"" and the task disappears.

My question is, if this program is used across 10 companies and theyre assigned hundreds of tasks, what would be the most logical/most efficient way of querying the Tasks?

1) Where all tasks, both active and complete stay in the Tasks table, and they table grows large over time, and basically fills with all the tasks marked IsComplete = ""true""?

2) Or create two tables, something like Tasks_Active and Tasks_Complete. And when the task is complete, move the record from the Task_Active table to the Complete one. This seems like active task querying (which is likely what will be done most) would be faster this way?

    seatingCapacity int NOT NULL,
    soundSystem varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    primary key(theatreID),
    cinemaID int foreign key references CinemaLocations(cinemaID)

each cinema location (2) has a number of theatres each, 6 for one cinema complex, and 4 for the second. I'm inserting theatre for the first cinema complex at the moment which currently looks like this:

    insert into Theatres 
    (theatreID, theatreName, seatingCapacity, soundSystem)
    values

I'm guessing I need to put-

    SELECT cinemaID FROM CinemaLocations where CinemaLocations.cinemaID = 1

\-somewhere but not sure where? Examples I've seen online seem to add the foreign key into the table as column data, but I only want this table to show when CinemaLocations.cinemaID = 1, so that I can have the same theatre table but with different data show when CinemaLocations.cinemaID = 2. So how do I make this table linked directly to a foreign key if its a certain value (being 1 in this case)?

Also, I've seen the JOIN command pop up here and there. Should I be adding that to get this to work?

`SELECT Host_ID, COUNT(*) from Table GROUP BY Host_ID HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2 AND Neighbourhood = ‘Brooklyn’ OR ‘Manhattan’ OR ‘Queens’ OR ‘Bronx’ OR ‘Staten Island’`

&#x200B;

TLDR; What is the best practice approach for comparing differences between records and values in two tables?

&#x200B;

I'm  setting up a routine that loads a table of Citi Bike station locations  in NYC daily to BigQuery. I want to write a query that shows what changes each day  (eg add or removal of a station, change in capacity, any other  inconsistencies).

So I was  thinking a union of a left and right join of current and prior day's table to see what was added or removed (I think I can use full outer join instead in BQ), but what's the best way to find changes in the  values of each record?

I was thinking I can outer join on multiple fields (using multiple queries?)  to find inequalities, but that seems messy and not sure it's the best  approach. Also I can write conditions on each field (eg WHERE  table\_A.field\_A IS NOT table\_B.field\_A) but that seems inefficient. I was also thinking a python script, but I haven't figured out the best  way to do that in BQ yet and also seems less efficient than clean SQL.

What is the best practice approach for comparing differences between records and values in two tables?

&#x200B;

edit:  I guess I should be more specific and say I am matching on \`station\_id\`.  So if a station is added or removed, it looks like EXCEPT will let me  know that. But if a station matches and for example the \`capacity\` or  \`services\` changes, what's the best way to identify matching records  (same \`station\_id\`) with changes to values in any of the other fields?",9,0,jonscrypto,2021-08-08 20:52:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/p0mqat/best_way_to_find_changes_to_a_table_imported_daily/,0,learnsql

n5djjb,Has anyone have experience with MySQL for Excel?,MySQL was integrated into my Excel upon request of my manager so we would spend less time while gathering data we need in weekly and monthly basis. I tried to download data to excel with a query which should be what I am supposed to do ; MySQL for Excel doesn't even let me to write a query so I ended up achieving nothing there as the data is quite big.

n3ehgv,Now What? (Where do I go from here?),"Hello!

I recently accepted a new job offer and in order to get ahead I took a course on Udemy to learn SQL since I knew it was heavily used in my new orgnaisation. I've completed the course and want to keep learning but I'm not really sure where to go or what level I'm at. 

The course I took ([https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/)) taught me a lot of the basics, things like creating tables, joins, updating, grouping, ordering, and triggers, but I also know that data analysis is a thing that will be expected of me in my new position and I didn't get much of that here in terms of visualisation, regression, etc. 

I have experience performing data analysis in R and in Excel, but have no idea how to go about it in SQL, can anyone point me towards a course/book/recommendation that they feel might fit my circumstances?

P.S. I know that you can also run SQL through R, but for now I'd prefer to just learn it standalone and maybe come back to that possibility later.",10,5,AveryLee213,2021-05-02 19:56:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/n3ehgv/now_what_where_do_i_go_from_here/,0,learnsql

ls7qeo,I hope this tool helps you all learn - SQL execution plan visualizer tool,"Hey y'all!  We're the team of engineers at SeeQR (it's pronounced exactly how you think it is) who have been working on a tool that will hopefully help you all learn SQL.

SeeQR works as a standalone application that allows you to either import your existing database or drop in a schema and populate your tables with records. Our build-in record generator allows users to create realistic data from nearly 200 data formats.

Once the data is created or imported, queries can then be run against these different schemas or scales to test their efficiency for different tasks. The statistics are then collected for comparison. Users can compare different queries within a schema or similar queries on different schemas/scales. We also created an execution plan visualizer for EXPLAIN/ ANALYZE.

Here's an [article](https://medium.com/p/f87f113c5f1a/) on how to use it!

This will allow you all to get a visual understanding of how PostgreSQL is planning the execution plans. We found this really helpful to play around with query scripts.

https://i.redd.it/8em4fbg1wmj61.gif

To try it out, visit [theSeeQR.io](http://theseeqr.io/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/SeeQR) for the application and documentation. If you like it, feel free to give us a GitHub star and some feedback.

I'm in college and just recently got interested in programming. Right now I starting to learn SQL since it will be beneficial (I hope) to my major (accounting) and expand from there.

That being said, my workplace (I work at my uni) gave me a wonderful opportunity to create a database to keep track of a program that is funded by the school. Stuff like student records, friends of the program, book inventory, etc are all kept on hard copies or multiple excel sheets that make it very confusing and time-consuming to update/keep track of. My main goal for this database is to be...

1. A simple database that is easy to update and simple to use for people that need to access the records or fix information (there are a lot of older workers in my office, who are more technically inept, I want to make the database really user-friendly for them and new workers)
2. Keep track of overlapping information, and making sure records are not repeated/duplicated into other sheets. 

I'm going to go with MS Access, to create my database, since I'm more familiar with the program but I am open to any advice.

They specifically said you do not have to include the id field when populating the table because the id field was set to be a primary key, and the db would automatically add values into it as you add more rows. However this is not the case.

When I don't specifically add an id, and just try to add fname and lname to column 2 and 3 I get a SQLException: Values not bound to statement. I eventually figured out it meant that I'm not adding the id field, but why is it different, and is there any way I can set it so that id's are generated automatically?

I suppose I could create a static id value in the class and a method to return the next one and increment, but that feels kind of hacky.

I can likely locate the datasets online but does anyone offhand know follow along for something like a full-scale project for one of these positions? If you were hiring for these rules what would you want to see in someone with soft skills but no technical hard skills in SQL?

Appreciate any help!

16frgc2,10 Years to build a Free SQL Editor,"My original post on /sql got a lot of great feedback so I thought I would similarly post here.

My name is Ryan Hamilton and I have spent large parts of the last 10+ years building an SQL Editor.  The tool is targeted at beginner data analysts, a lot of effort has gone into charting, visualizing and excel export. No effort has been put into automating DBA tasks. If this sounds useful to you, it's Free, please give it a try and let me know any feedback:

qStudio  [https://www.timestored.com/qstudio/](https://www.timestored.com/qstudio/)

It works with [every popular database](https://www.timestored.com/qstudio/database/): MySQL / PostgreSQL / Oracle / SQL Server / SQLite

To answer some likely questions:

**How is this particularly useful to learnSQL**:

DuckDB and Sqlite are bundled with qStudio to allow you to get started straight away. 
This video demonstrates creating a database, a table, then running queries with just qStudio and DuckDB:
https://www.timestored.com/qstudio/help/duckdb-sql-editor

**History**:  

It started 11  years ago when I was working with a niche SQL like database and found that no existing SQL editors worked at all, so I created one that worked for that specific database.  I gave it to some others I worked with and then added requested features and changes based on user demand for the next few years. Most of my users only query data, they don't create databases from scratch, hence the specialization.  10 Years later I increasingly found myself using other more standard SQL databases so I made it work with them too. 

**What has 10 years taught you?**

You can never predict what users will do with your software!!

 * I've had people try to run it on old nokias, on android, on 20 year old linux systems. 
 * One person sent me a hand edited java VM bytecode change to fix an editor bug.
 * If I could go back, I would have supported multiple databases from the start. It was harder to add later and restricted the usage of the tool for a long time.
 * I would have open sourced it from the start


**What influenced the design?**

You can probably tell from the screenshots, I love **notepad++ and windows 95**. Similar to notepad++ it autosaves documents in progress and allows a lot of tab interaciton, e.g. right click on doc link to jump to location in windows explorer. Windows 95 to me was the pinnacle of friendly design, proper 3D buttons and obvious controls that are clickable. Adding FlatLaf last year was essential to give qStudio a modern look and a proper dark theme. (https://www.timestored.com/b/qstudio-2-05-dark-theme-and-high-dpi-support/)


I would like to say a big thanks to 

 1. All the users over the years that reported bugs and gave feature suggestions. 
 2. Thanks to the companies that financed the project in the past. 
 3. Thanks to the upstream libraries, jfreechart/flatlaf are awesome.

11x9sqa,understanding SQL Views,"Hi everyone,

SQL views can be a useful tool for simplifying complex queries and providing a layer of abstraction between the user and the underlying database tables. However, one common question that arises is whether a view will automatically update when the underlying table is modified.

Let's consider an example. Suppose you created a view in SQL using the following syntax:

CREATE VIEW sales_view AS
SELECT *
FROM sales;

Now, let's say that the table ""sales"" gets updated at some point in the future. Will the view ""sales_view"" also be updated automatically to reflect these changes?",8,13,captaintyler98,2023-03-21 07:27:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/11x9sqa/understanding_sql_views/,0,learnsql

And with the type of transaction included, I get more rows of data returned even if the period is the same.

Shouldn't we get all rows based on the condition irrespective of the columns selected. Can anyone explain this please

10l0zc3,SQL : Join a monthly revenue table with a daily table,"I'm feeling a really overwhelmed, this is my first 'advanced' query and I'm not sure how to even think on how to start this. I welcome all advice/conversations that advises how to start thinking about creating this query.

&#x200B;

I have 2 tables: *snap\_data\_daily\_feed* and *story\_revenue\_monthly*.

About the tables:

In snapchat a story contains multiple snaps.

The story table contains revenue for each Publishers stories for a month including story id, story name and story post date, no snap data.

The snap table contains daily metrics, like views, snap id, snap name, snap post date, story id, story name, story total views for the day.

*story\_revenue\_monthly* contains story revenue info for the month, for example the *m.start\_date* in the query below would always be the 1st of the month (ex: 2022-12-01) and *m.end\_date* (2022-12-31) would always be the last day of that month.

*snap\_data\_daily\_feed* contains snap daily performance and also contains a 'to\_date' which is the date we fetched the performance data for each snap, similar to how the story revenue data has a start\_date and end\_date for the revenue collected.

What I want to do is get the revenue for each snap, based on views for that snap for that month.

I have the below query that's testing this out w. a story id, but it feels far from done and I'm not sure how to brainstorm the next step:

&#x200B;

    with a as (
    select 
        d.story_id as story_id,
        d.story_name as story_name,
        d.story_posttime as story_posttime,
        sum(d.totalviews) as total_views
    from snap_data_daily_feed d
        group by 1, 2, 3
    ),
    
    b as (
    select
        m.story_id as story_id,
        m.story_name as story_name,
        m.story_start_date as story_start_date,
        m.aggregated_metrics_revenue as revenue
    from story_revenue_monthly m
    ),
    
    c as (
    select
        a.story_id,
        a.story_name,
        b.story_id,
        b.story_name,
        b.story_start_date,
        b.revenue,
        a.total_views
    from a
    join b
        on a.story_id = b.story_id
        and a.story_name = b.story_name
        and a.story_posttime::date = b.story_start_date::date 
    )
    
    select * from c
    where story_id = '3432482';

&#x200B;

I'm adding a table to show what the results of the above look like also:

|story\_id|story\_name|story\_id|story\_name|story\_start\_date|revenue|total\_views|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|3432482|Best Cough Syrup|3432482|Best Cough Syrup|2021-08-10|1.66|86,360,322|

&#x200B;

I've tried to add a calculated field that uses the **(total\_views / sum(total\_views)) \* sum(revenue)**  as **sum\_total\_views** but for I see the same amount as the total\_views. Why does that happen? I feel it has to do w. the group by.

Updated query:  


    with daily_snap as (
    select 
        d.story_id as story_id,
        d.story_name as story_name,
        d.story_posttime as story_posttime,
        d.totalviews as total_views,
        sum(d.totalviews) as sum_total_views,
        d.snap_id as snap_id,
        d.snap_name as snap_name

        group by 1, 2,3,4,6,7
    ),

    select
        m.story_id as story_id,
        m.story_name as story_name,
        m.story_start_date as story_start_date,
        sum(m.aggregated_metrics_revenue) as revenue
    from story_revenue_monthly m
        group by 1, 2, 3
    ),
    
    snap_revenue as (
    select
        daily_snap.story_id,
        daily_snap.story_name,
        monthly_rev.story_start_date,
        monthly_rev.revenue,
        daily_snap.total_views,
        daily_snap.sum_total_views,
        daily_snap.snap_id,
        daily_snap.snap_name,
        (daily_snap.total_views / daily_snap.sum_total_views)::float as percentage,
        (daily_snap.total_views / sum(daily_snap.total_views)) * sum(monthly_rev.revenue) as snap_revenue
    from daily_snap
    join monthly_rev
        on daily_snap.story_id = monthly_rev.story_id
        and daily_snap.story_name = monthly_rev.story_name

    )
    
    select *

The one in particular that I'm struggling with now has to do with a database I built to simulate a university.

One of the steps in the assignment asks me to use a PIVOT to have DepartmentName as a column and then each ProgramName as it's own column, with the number of courses for each ProgramName as counted values for each ProgramName column.

When you need to quickly correct an update statement gone bad, cross-database joins against a recently recovered database, and your corrupted database can be a lifesaver. Much faster than dropping, recreating objects, and having to deal with dependencies.  I learned this a long long time ago.....

I just purchased A Curious Moon.  I have never used Postgres but it seemed like a fun way to learn it and get exposed to more than just using vanilla SQL in Access.  The into suggests downloading to a VM, but I've downloaded Python, SQL Server Studio and other things straight to my laptop without a VM and used them so not sure why they recommended a VM.  

Hard to find posts relevant to this book specifically so wanted to ask here before I did anything.  I am trying to avoid logistical issues and certain features not working because I installed with the wrong method and just focus on the material and learning.

uwvllg,How do I import a .xlsx file using Dbeaver in an MS SQL database (MacOS)?,"So I am trying to import an excel file into a MS SQL database and it is only giving me an option to import a .csv file format.

The step I am currently doing is right-clicking 'tables' and selecting 'import data' and 'import source' pops up but I do not see an option to select different format types. I am a novice at databases right now so I am sure I am overlooking something.

Thanks!

uh8rap,"Starting from more-or-less scratch, what is the best-practice way to design an application that heavily relies on databases — using an ORM for everything, picking a dialect and sticking with it, or something else?","Hello!  I’m at a point in a fairly massive project where I need to decide how the rest of the project is going to go forward, and as the sole software developer at my workplace I have nobody to bounce this off of.

So here’s my situation — I am building a Server and Client application whose goal is to print out information when a user swipes their access card.  You swipe your card on a client kiosk, it sends a query to the server application, it sends back the result to the client, and a nicely formatted document is constructed and printed out.

Things are going great, and I already have a fully functional version of this using SQLite (for some reason).  I’m rebuilding the database parts of it because that proof of concept was a bit of a mess, and I’m hoping I can adhere to “best practices”.  Unfortunately, I don’t know what those are in this context, so I’m hoping I can get some advice on this front.  I’m torn between a few different options, and they all have pros and cons:

* set up the whole application to utilize an ORM (sqlalchemy) for the entirety of its functions — this introduces complications and speed bottlenecks, as some of the most useful functions in this context are specific to one database engine, but supposedly makes switching databases an easy task
* Use an ORM only to send raw SQL commands, read from SQL files.  Every SQL operation in its own file, like the updating from external data sources, deleting orphaned data, and fetching data in their own respective files.  This is generally faster but exposes the SQL functions to the user and requires them to be re-written any time the SQL dialect is changed
* Pick a database and stick with it, developing the whole application under the assumption that the database will never have to change.  This one is the most enticing as I know PostgreSQL pretty well but it would require many functions to be completely rewritten if the database were to change (namely Psycopg2’s copy_expert or copy_from to mass update millions of rows from a CSV).  PostgreSQL seems to be quite robust and actively developed, so I feel like picking this and sticking with it might be a safe bet as it isn’t likely to go extinct in the near future.
* Some combination of the above, having functions that would be called if the database type is PostgreSQL and different generic functions in all other cases.  Either hard coded or as SQL files that could be read in as necessary.

I could pick up and run with any of these in the short term and get the job done, but I want this to be maintainable and scalable as possible going forward, especially in the event that I go on to bigger and better things and have to leave this in someone else’s hands.  Is there a clearly superior method here?  Or an “industry standard” / “industry accepted” way to approach this problem and problems like it?

tkra4a,Help with understanding ALL required please,"Hey There, 

So I've been solving exercises here [https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT\_within\_SELECT\_Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_within_SELECT_Tutorial) and all went well until I stumbled upon exercises 7 and 8.

Table is simple, it just contains the names of all countries along with continent it's on, it's population and area.

Ask for the taks no 7 is:

>**Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the** **continent, the** **name** **and the** **area:**

and their solution is:

    SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
      WHERE area >= ALL
        (SELECT area FROM world y
            WHERE y.continent=x.continent
            AND area > 0)

What I can't get is how exactly the subquery and ALL work.

I've seen examples of ALL in other tutorials and I seem to be understanding how it works, but I'm not sure here what the subquery returns, especially `WHERE y.continent=x.continent` doesn't make sense to me.

Can someone explain it to me please step by step?",9,3,Matheos7,2022-03-23 10:56:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/tkra4a/help_with_understanding_all_required_please/,0,learnsql

t9gna2,Why does querying it as temporary table work?,"I'm solving this problem on leetcode: 

&#x200B;

Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report null.   


Table: Employee

\+-------------------------------+  
| Column Name | Type |

\+-------------------------------+  
| id                           | int |

| salary                    | int |  
\+-------------------------------+  
id is the primary key of this table. Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee. 

My original solution was:

SELECT DISTINCT(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary 

FROM Employee

ORDER BY salary 

DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;  


However, this was not accepted. Their reason was that if the table only contains one employee, then there is no such as second highest salary. One of their recommended solutions was to simply make this a temporary table:

SELECT (

SELECT DISTINCT(Salary) 

FROM Employee 

ORDER BY Salary DESC 

LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) 

AS SecondHighestSalary;

szsavr,Question about Min/Max,"  

This is something I have always wondered. When I am using max, is there a simpler way to pull the values from the other fields that are tied to the max value.

For example:

I want the highest date for each food type, so the results would be:

**Results:**  
5          Burgers          7/6/2021  
4          Tacos              8/6/2021

**Records:**  
Record 1 – ID = 1, Type = tacos, date = 5/6/2021  
Record 2 – ID = 2, Type = burgers, date = 1/27/2021  
Record 3 – ID = 3, Type = tacos, date = 2/6/2021  
Record 4 – ID = 4, Type = tacos, date = 8/6/2021  
Record 5 – ID = 5, Type = burgers, date = 7/6/2021

I would typically do something like this but it just feels like there should be a simpler way of getting those values. What if there were multiple records with the same value? 

Select table1.ID, table1.Type, table1.Date  
from table1  
Inner join (Select type, max(date) date from table group by type) table2  
on table1.type = table2.type and table1.date = table2.date",6,3,AvatarKittie,2022-02-23 21:19:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/szsavr/question_about_minmax/,0,learnsql
sp4adx,How much SQL do I need to know to get a starting job?,"I have spent the past couple months doing my own learning in the field of data analysis.

s0xyha,Personal music database to learn SQL,"For a while I have had the idea of setting up a personal local database for information regarding music that I enjoy and through that learn more about SQL and database management (Currently I only know basic query syntax). The idea would be to have tables such as the following:

&nbsp;

**table: tracks**

*id*

*track name/title*

*artist/composer*

*rating*

*genre*

*tags* (containing a list of tags such as ""flow"", ""happy"", etc.)

&nbsp;

I would want to be able to store and access this database locally. The main problem I am trying to solve for myself here is that I currently have names of about 3000 tracks of music I very much care about. They're all in a single markdown file and the issue I'm seeing is that I am mostly aware of music that I recently found and I often pass over older tracks (I still very much love them, I just can't remember what I associate with this many different tracks). With the database I want to be able to have a good backend that I can later throw all kinds of queries and/or visualizations on if I so desire (say, find all tracks I gave the tag ""happy"", the genre classical music and a rating of more than 4).

&nbsp;

So in the end my objective is to both get a functional tool for me to use out of this (the database) and to improve my SQL skills in the process. The advantages of my current markdown file are that it is an open-source format, super-portable (i.e. I can simply copy paste it to a different system with a different OS and I know I will always be able to access it) and incredibly simple to handle and interact with (well, it's a markdown file..). With the database I would ideally want to conserve all these advantages, while giving me the power to quickly do queries as I mentioned above.

&nbsp;

My questions to you would be:

- Do you have recommendations on which realization of the database I should choose? SQL Server, MySQL, etc. (keeping in mind I would want to ideally keep the functional advantages I mentioned above)

- Do you have any good educational material to suggest (videos, blog posts, etc.) to help me realize this idea?

- Do you have any other recommendations on the realization of this database? (for example the tag system - I'm not sure if a field with a list of tags is the best way to go about this)

&nbsp;

Criticisms are welcome too of course! (Even if you think this whole idea is bs)

rooi9s,Hit a wall with trying to import CSV file with null values into PostgreSQL via pgadmin 4.,"**Objective**: Import a csv file into PostgreSQL using pgadmin 4 (since I'm new at this and that's the most my skill level will allow). That csv file has columns with empty (null?) values that also need to be imported into the SQL database into columns that have datatype NUMERIC.

**Problem**: I can't seem to manage the null values. Either (a) I get an invalid input syntax error, (b) I can alter the debit and credit columns to be VARCHAR datatypes, but then I have my debits and credits as a bunch of strings that I can't do math with.

See below for specifics:

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've searched all over Google, Reddit, stackexchange, but cannot seem to find a solution to this problem.

1. I've set up a table in pgadmin via the following query:

CREATE TABLE bank\_import(

    bank\_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    
    bank\_account VARCHAR(25),
    
    trans\_date TIMESTAMP,
    
    post\_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    
    check\_no SMALLINT,
    
    bank\_description VARCHAR(50),
    
    bank\_debit NUMERIC,
    
    bank\_credit NUMERIC

)

2. I've downloaded the CSV file from my bank that has my transactions from the previous month and corresponds identically to the columns above (except for bank\_id).

3. In the CSV file, there are no values in the ""check\_no"" column because this only gets a value when I write a check, and I don't do that a ton. Also, there will ONLY be a value in either the ""bank\_debit"" or the ""bank\_credit"" column, but never both. So in any given row, either the bank\_debit column or the bank\_credit column will be blank.

4. When I import the CSV file, I get this error:

1. ERROR:  invalid input syntax for type smallint: """"
2. I tried googling the answer. This site [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9282154/importing-csv-file-with-null-values-into-phpmyadmin](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9282154/importing-csv-file-with-null-values-into-phpmyadmin) and a few others seem to suggest setting the Null Strings option in pgadmin to NULL.
3. So I did that and got this error:
4. ERROR:  invalid input syntax for type smallint: """"
5. Okay, so let me alter the table. I'll set the check\_no, bank\_debit, and bank\_credit to VARCHAR(50). When I do that, I'm able to import the CSV data just fine, but now there's another problem: All of the data in the debit and credit columns are now strings, and that's not gonna work since I can't do math stuff with a string.

And that's it. I'm completely stumped. I suppose I could manually edit the csv file to have 0's instead of blank cells, but that defeats the purpose of trying to automate this process. I might as well just manually insert the rows and not bother with the damned thing.

Maybe I could UPDATE the table to change all of the blanks to 0's and then change the entire column back to numeric? But again, that sounds like a lot of rigamarole for what should be a simple process. And besides, what about the next time I need to import a csv file?

Perhaps I could copy all of the rows to a different table? But then, what do I do with my numbers that are currently sitting as string values? And what about those blank values?",8,4,creativedisco,2021-12-26 03:44:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/rooi9s/hit_a_wall_with_trying_to_import_csv_file_with/,0,learnsql
ro7pkq,How should I structure my database?,"Hi guys!

I have a rather small database of about 1060 rows, containing questions for an app I'm building. I have been working on the app for about +3 years on- and off (cannot see an ending to this LOL). And almost from the start I questioned myself if the chosen database structure was ""correct"" - and sure it works, but I can see some problems - mostly regarding the ""reusability"".

Let say that I have different ""Subjects"" - ""cars"" for example. In that car subject, I have ""topics"" like ""breaks"", ""engine"", ""fluids"" etc. And every topic has some questions and answers to them. Currently a questions ""belongs to"" a topic, and a topic belongs to subject. I have done this with a extra id column. ""topic_id"", ""subject_id"". This works, but what if I want to have the same question in two different topics, this leaves me with no other choice than to have duplicate questions. And if all data would be static forever that won't be a problem, but it will be a problem if I have to moderate duplicate questions over several different topics.

The same goes for images that relates to either a Subject, topic or a question. It would be smoother not to have an `image` colum on every table. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to ""reuse"" an image for multipel questions without being forced to moderate all of the different questions that use the same image?

What would be your approach to this?",6,1,Kuken500,2021-12-25 10:53:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/ro7pkq/how_should_i_structure_my_database/,0,learnsql

r6lwwh,How can I return rows that fully satisfy an Inner Join?,"I have a 1 to many table structure (questions and tags) and I need to return the rows that have the same tags or more.

For instance I have 3 questions. If the first question has a tag of 'SQL' and the second has tags of 'SQL' and 'PHP' and the third question has tags of 'PHP' 'SQL' and 'HTTP' and the user searches for tags 'PHP' and 'SQL' then only quesions 2 and 3 should be returned.

    WITH cte_associated_tags(ID) AS
    (
      SELECT ID
      FROM Tag
      Where name in ('php','sql')
    )
     
     SELECT Q.ID, title, Qt.tagID

       INNEr JOIN QuestionTag QT on QT.questionID = Q.ID
       INNEr JOIN cte_associated_tags T on T.ID = Qt.tagID
    
    this doesnt work either:
     SELECT Q.ID, title, Qt.tagID

       INNEr JOIN QuestionTag QT on QT.questionID = Q.ID
       -- INNEr JOIN cte_associated_tags T on T.ID = Qt.tagID

My logic is that to return rows that satisfy the full inner join of the CTE. But I cant figure out how to do so. The second query doesnt work because a column cant have multiple values and I also dont want to join on the same table multiple times (as many times the tags appear).

qptvem,Little Sql Help - Coalesce/Case?,"Hi,

I've got a sql question that I'm struggling with wrapping my head around.

I've got two columns.  

* Column A , can contain null values and the names A, B, and C
* Column B, can't contain null values and can contain A, B and U.  


I want to say:

SELECT

Column A - If A Then Adam. If B then Brent and if C Then Collin.  If Null go to Column B.

Column B - If A then Adam. If B then Brent if U then Unknown.

&#x200B;

I know I can use the COALESCE function to give me the first non null value between the two columns... and this would be fine if I just wanted to leave the columns with A,B,C, or U... but since I want names to display rather than just the first initial, I'm having a hard time getting this down.

ms50u4,Newbie question,"Hi, I've been playing around on w3s site: [https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql\_select\_all](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all)

I wanted to list \[Employee, their totals deals count, name of a country with most deals\], but I only managed to do this:

`SELECT Employees.FirstName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) as Deals, Customers.Country FROM Employees LEFT JOIN Orders ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID LEFT JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID GROUP BY Employees.FirstName, Customers.Country ORDER BY Deals DESC`

If to leave grouping by country out, I'll get the number of deals I want, but the country in the last column will be wrong. What the query should be? I'm really clueless.

Also I can't use CONCAT() in this query for some reason. It gives me an error ""Error 1: could not prepare statement (1 no such function: CONCAT)"" What am I doing wrong?

`SELECT CONCAT(Employees.FirstName, ' ', Employees.LastName), COUNT(Orders.OrderID) as Deals, Customers.Country FROM Employees LEFT JOIN Orders ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID LEFT JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID GROUP BY Employees.FirstName, Customers.Country ORDER BY Deals DESC`

Here it works: `SELECT CONCAT(Employees.FirstName, ' ', Employees.LastName) as Manager FROM Employees`

&#x200B;

Edit:

Solved it. Maybe there's a better solution, but the one that worked for me is:

`SELECT t.Manager, SUM(t.Deals) as TotalDeals, t.Country FROM (SELECT Employees.FirstName || ' ' || Employees.LastName AS Manager, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) as Deals, Customers.Country FROM Employees LEFT JOIN Orders ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID LEFT JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID GROUP BY Manager, Customers.Country ORDER BY Deals DESC) t GROUP BY Manager ORDER BY Deals DESC`

j2b5ks,How Do Recommendation Systems Work? [Netflix],"I have recently built a recommendation system at work and I was quite fascinated by application of recommendation system so I summarized high level of different types of recommendation system. To summarize what I have learned. 

1. Content based recommendation system requires a lot of knowledge about user and product 
2. Collaborative Filtering will require no knowledge about user or product but there are also 2 different types. 
   1. Memory based - item item similarity 
   2. Model based - matrix factorization 
3. Knowing what metric you would want to use for recommendation system is important

I also found out that Netflix uses a combination model which is really cool.

cy120e,"In SQL language, what does the keyword 'INDEX' do in the following code?","Sorry my knowledge of SQL is little. I'm actually trying to follow a textbook on C# Entity Framework.

    CREATE TABLE SalesCampaigns(

bbk6l3,I need an idiots guide to setting up triggers,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I'm only just dipping my toe into the world of SQL and have over the past 2 years used it to create some ODBC/Microsoft Query/Excel reports for work. These have just been basic SELECT, WHERE queries, but recently our IT guy left and the business would like me to patch in wherever I can.

&#x200B;

We have a customer who has an electronic notification setup so that they receive an email when a container is received. I've got the query but I need to know how to set up a trigger on the database so that when a certain column in the table turns from 0 to 1, it runs the query. We're looking to move all of our queries and emailing side over to an automated program such as easymorph or RSSbus so the sending of the email is straight forward. My director has asked me if I can recreate the query running and I don't have a clue where to start with the trigger aspect. I can just get the info if I manually enter the containercode as a parameter, but obviously it needs to be an automated process which runs upon the completion of a container receipt.

&#x200B;

As I've only every run queries through Excel, could anyone talk me through what I would need to do to set up a trigger? 

&#x200B;

Basically there is a table called EXPRECPT which has a column called RECEIPT\_COMPLETE. It visually has a yes or no but I've figured out that it's either 1 or 0. So I need to set up at trigger to say when it becomes 1 then run the query and output it to either a csv or a view. (What would be the best way to do it?)

&#x200B;

6mwaox,[Tutorial] How to set up a MySQL testing environment (on a Mac) | IMHO the most important step to get started,"First of all – I'm by no means a MySQL expert … all my knowledge comes from learning by doing. I wish that somebody sent me a link to a tutorial like the one I share today when I got started.

For me, the most important part of getting into MySQL was actually having a testing environment and the ability to import my excel/csv data to some tables. 

This is why I wrote the following tutorial. It's for bloody beginners working on a Mac (although the approach should work on windows as well). In the tutorial I show how you get set up with a testing environment that enables you to do your first local queries. 

I hope this approach helps someone out there:

4koa9b,"I write SQL for work almost all day, but I feel like I haven't learned anything in years","I had to learn to write SQL queries for work when we moved from MS Access to Oracle SQLDeveloper. That was about 3 years ago, and now I can write a query like a pro (I think) involving many inner/outer joins (implicit or explicit) and subqueries. 

I feel like I can get almost any report I want, but I haven't felt like I've improved in a while. I don't use cursors or any stored procedures. I know a tiny bit of PLSQL but I mostly use python with a DB connection if I need to do anything where the PL aspect would come in.

Permissions wise, I can create tables in my own tablespace off of our agencies tables, but I was told not to create indexes. I have used views a few times but their performance is always so bad that I just create tables since space is pretty freely available (though I have ran into a few rejections when I try to do something big).

I don't mind taking a class, or teaching myself, but I just don't know where to look. I feel like I should learn a bit more about the transaction system and then I'd like to learn to do more things in iterative chunks. 

I one time tried to delete 1.4m rows from a table with 20m rows and management got very mad at me - I didn't know how to make that process more computationally manageable, so I ended up just creating a new table as a select statement that excluded those 1.4m rows. (NOTE: I have read/query access on about 200 tables and I have my own tablespace to create temp tables and the such)

Is it worth it to learn anything else? Should I just stay at the query level and focus on using that elsewhere like in python for my analyses and things? Does anyone have a suggestion about resources to improve? Thanks!

1. Does IS NULL check whether the column is *allowed* to have null values (like when the table is created and you must set either null or not null)?

I pulled a couple examples, but I did those manually for a single person in a shorter time period. I'm trying to do this YTD for a couple hundred people, and that's obviously not feasible.

Each sale would be associated to the calls above because they: have the same phone number, come before the sale timestamp, and both timestamps occurred the same day. If there is no call (incoming or outgoing) associated to the phone number, or the call timestamp occurred on a different day, it would be blank or null.

1. Which DB should I use to practice? mySQL or PostgreSQL?
2. Which IDE?
3. Any interesting data sets that are large enough to be challenging for me, but won't choke my machine?

111ajw6,Getting an SQL certification for jobs,"Hello!  I'm somewhat new to programming and SQL (had a few classes in college but I got a biology degree) and I'm looking to transition to a tech career. I have worked as an analyst for 4 years at a research lab but recently I've decided lab work just isn't what I want to do anymore. I was planning on doing some self-taught classes and then getting certifications for SQL and Python. I'm hoping I can switch to more of a data analyst role that would allow me to work from home. 

So my question is this:   Would getting my SQL certification with Oracle or another certification be something that could help me transition to a new field? I don't want to do another college degree if possible and the bootcamps seem like a good idea, but I can't stop working for 6 months and I'm not sure how employers view those bootcamp degrees.

I ran the following query to find duplicate rows in a timestamps column and put them in a new table.

    CREATE TABLE `duplicate_timestamps`
    SELECT `start_time`, COUNT(*) AS occurances
    	FROM `dataset`
    	GROUP BY `start_time`
    	HAVING occurances > 1
    	ORDER BY start_time;

This worked okay and completed within a few minutes IIRC. Now that I have a list of which rows have duplicate timestamps, I want to single out those rows from my original table so that I can review the other columns for patterns, right? So I am trying to use a LEFT JOIN on the original table like so:

    CREATE TABLE 'duplicate_timestamps_with_details'
    SELECT ride_id, table1.start_time, end_time, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id, start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng

    	INNER JOIN `duplicate_timestamps` AS table2
    	ON table1.started_time = table2.start_time
    	ORDER BY start_time

But I ran this query, and so far it has been going for >30 minutes. I have a MySQL server running on a home linux server, 8GB ram, i5 cpu from \~2016. So, here are my questions:

Is this the best way to do this? Is my server too under powered for this? Or Is there a better way to structure my query to single out the duplicate rows and still be able to view the other columns' data? Can you see any other issues with my methods that I'm not aware of?

xszrza,Help with a query using three tables?,"https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/jKTrbH4EfKtRttkmXNoUXN/0

So I hope I set up this fiddle correctly.

Essentially in this system there's teams that consist of users, and teams have elo (a number indicating skill rating). There are teams of two and teams of one. Every user has exactly one team that consists of a single member to allow for individual rating.

**Users table**

id | name
---|---
1 | Bob
2| Alfred
3| Cole
4| Dean


**Members table**

id | team_id | user_id
---|---|----
1 | 1 | 1
2| 2| 2
3| 3| 3
4| 4| 4
5| 5| 1
6| 5| 2
7| 6| 3
8| 6| 4
9| 7| 2
10| 7| 3
11| 8| 1
12| 8| 4


**Elos table**

id | team_id | elo
---|---|----
1 | 1 | 1239
2| 2| 1002
3| 3| 2400
4| 4| 1874
5| 5| 1990
6| 6| 2008
7| 7| 1500
8| 8| 1774




What I want to do is essentially get the individual elos of each user.

Something like:

For all teams, grab the teams that have only a single member. For all these single teams, grab the elo of that team. Then sort these elos, and show the name of the user on that team alongside their elo.

I can figure out parts of this, but I can't get the whole thing to work.

I can figure out how to **get all team_ids for the single-person teams**

`SELECT team_id FROM members GROUP BY team_id HAVING COUNT(team_id) = 1;`

Even further, I can **get the elo for each team with only one person**

    SELECT members.team_id, elos.elo
    FROM
    members INNER JOIN elos ON members.team_id = elos.team_id
    GROUP BY members.team_id, elos.elo 
    HAVING COUNT(members.team_id) = 1;

What I'm having a hard time is also getting the user's name for each of these teams that only have one person

I tried to add another INNER JOIN to it, but this doesn't work:

    SELECT members.team_id, elos.elo
    FROM
    members INNER JOIN elos ON members.team_id = elos.team_id
    INNER JOIN users ON users.id = members.user_id
    GROUP BY members.team_id, elos.elo, users.name
    HAVING COUNT(members.team_id) = 1;

xhd0re,Best/More efficient way of getting counts?,"Hi, I am extremely new to SQL so this is certainly a noob question.

I have a program assignment that is to do with events and ticketing. The idea is to display a page that lists all events (in an events table), alongside a simple count of how many people are attending each one (pulled from the attendees table). I have simplified everything for this example.

Right now my solution is simplistic. I get all the events ('SELECT id, name FROM events') but then I have the program iterate each row in events and do a subsequent (' SELECT count(id) FROM attendees where event\_id = x) kind of thing.

Obviously this seems super inefficient because if there is 100 events to display then you have to make 100 queries to render the page. I mean I could limit each page to 10 events at a time or something but I'm still wondering if there is a way to get the attendee count and events data in one query. I have tried combining implementations with INNER JOIN and GROUP BY but I haven't yet found something that seems to work.

I'm able to get a simple list with this:

    SELECT e.event_id, COUNT(*) FROM attendees e INNER JOIN events d ON d.id = e.event_id GROUP BY e.event_id;

But can't crack getting all the event data to show up with it.

TLDR:

EVENTS

|id|name|
|:-|:-|
|1|Party|
|2|Wedding|

ATTENDEES:

|id|name|event\_id|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|John|1|
|2|Jane|2|
|3|Jack|2|

|id|name|count|
|:-|:-|:-|

x91koz,How to combine data from multiple tables into a object using ORM from SQLAlchemy?,"I have mostly worked with non relational databases where operations like this were rather 'simple' and still figuring out what the 'right' way to do this is with a relational database using ORM. 

&#x200B;

I am using fastapi with postgresql and SQLalchemy. I have to classes and two tables.

&#x200B;

The \`customer\` table, which stores an \`id\` and \`name\` for each customer. 

As well as a \`haircut\` table which stores \`id\`, \`customer\_id\`, \`timestamp\` and \`hair\_length\`. Now when a user navigates to a customer profile in my frontend, I want to load this customers data (name and haircuts). So a \`customer\` looks like this:

    class Customer:
      id: str
      first_name: str
      last_name: str
      haircuts: List[Haircut]

In a non relational database I would just store an object such as this for every customer and send that object back to the frontend. But how do I correctly build the same object or return the same data from the backend while using a relational database? Should my pydantic schema for a customer reflect this? So the problem comes down to this: 

I have a structure setup with a pydantic schema for a \`customer\` and a database model and it all works but I now want to also include data from another table (\`haircut\`) and make this data part of my \`customer\` object. How do I do this? Sorry if the question is kind of long and vague but pretty stuck here.

w6suc9,Convert SELECT FROM query to a Table,"Good morning all,

I have a mysql table (tablename) that contains a datetime value (date\_opened)...

I wanted to create a query that gave me running cumulative count of records by hour. I somehow managed to achieve this with the below:

    SELECT
        Hour AS `Hour Opened`,
        total AS 'Count',
        @running_count := @running_count + total AS Cumulative
    FROM(
        SELECT time_format(time(date_opened), '%H:00') AS Hour, COUNT(*) AS total
        FROM tablename
        WHERE date(date_opened) = date_sub(date(now()), interval 2 day)
        GROUP BY Hour
        ORDER BY hour) AS u
    CROSS JOIN (SELECT @running_count := 0) AS var

All works well and gives me my desired result:

|Hour Opened|Count|Cumulative|
|:-|:-|:-|
|07:00|3|3|
|08:00|2|5|
|09:00|3|8|
|10:00|4|12|

w5fs31,Confused about foreign keys,"I'm confused about foreign keys. I know how to set them up and what they do, but pulling data out utilizing them is confusing to me. 

Lets say a database table has tasks for an employee to do, and the [Task] table has tasks with employees assigned with employeeId, their departmentId, and serviceId for the work theyre supposed to do.

I want to display this task and all of its data. It would not be very useful to see all these Id's associated with it, so ofcourse employeeId would resolve to their name, department Id to department name, and the service theyre supposed to offer.

So for example Jim Jones, Sales Department, Follow up on lead. 

The only way I could figure this out, was to create a stored procedure for a View, and have all the Ids resolve to their appropriate names.

Is this the appropriate way? To create views for every time I want to do this? 

Or is there an easier... select query?",6,5,CreativeReputation12,2022-07-22 17:08:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/w5fs31/confused_about_foreign_keys/,0,learnsql

vyy2et,Trying to put together an AFTER UPDATE trigger (I think) using PHPmyadmin.,"I'm working in PHPMyAdmin using SQL and am trying to create an after update trigger (I am assuming this is the correct trigger to use). Even after researching, I'm struggling getting my head around what needs to happen in an AFTER UPDATE trigger.

I essentially have two tables holding data: stock and lables. 

I am trying to acheive the following: when the user has submitted a new entry on a html form sending information to the table 'labels' on the backend, I want that to trigger an update to a new table called 'products\_to\_print'.

I need that update to be the follwing: The 'products\_to\_print' table should pull through all new information submitted to the labels table in addition to the columns 'ingredients', 'allergens', 'final\_cut\_process' in the table called 'stock'. The column that would be the innerjoin in both tables would be a 'Stock' column ie labels.Stock=stock.Stock. The text string in this column would be identical in both the labels and stock tables. 

Can anyone point me in the right direction in terms of creating a trigger, how they work and what I need to look at putting inside the trigger to help me achieve what I need?

I have tried the below as an option however the products\_to\_print table doesn't further update when new entries are being added to the labels table. How can I make that happen??

`INSERT INTO products_to_print (stock, ingredients, allergens, batchid, deliveryid)`

`SELECT labels.Stock, stock.Ingredients, stock.Allergens, labels.BatchID, labels.DeliveryID` 

`FROM labels`

There's a query I'm seeing that kiiiind of makes sense, but I want to make sure I'm understanding what it's doing under the hood.

&#x200B;

For reference, there's a table called teams, that has 14 distinct team names and a team id as a primary key. There is also a table called master\_plan that has a team column with the same names but repeated a bunch because there's \~64k entries.

&#x200B;

The nested select in the following code is what's got me scratching my head:

&#x200B;

    insert into plans(start, title, team_id, description)
    select
    	start_time_utc::timestamp,
    	title,

    	description
    	from csvs.master_plan
    	where target = 'Enceladus' and title is not null;

is the nested select basically iterating through each row in the master\_plan and then using the smaller table called teams as a lookup table like in excel to pull the id? like literally going row by row by row by row etc etc. I get that its creating a column of the id, but I guess the logic has me somewhat confused.

&#x200B;

If I switched it to:

    (select id from teams where csvs.master_plan.team = name)

would that work? to me that makes sense as in each row of master plan's team column uses the teams table to look up the corresponding id.",6,3,Dylanb993,2022-03-09 00:57:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/t9vooo/nested_select_statement_has_me_a_bit_confused/,0,learnsql

str6qi,SQL Function to Split Months from Table,"**EDIT: I've figured it out :)**

I want to be able to take a table that has a date column where the date could be anything at all (some might be from 2009, some might be from 2020) and split them into time period categories from the 1st to the 15th, then the 16th to the end of the month, for every month/year combination that has a date entry.

So Jan 7, 2022 would fall into ""Jan 1st to Jan 15th, 2022"" while Jan 19 would fall into ""Jan 16th to Jan 31, 2022"".

I found some[ similar questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62193795/sql-function-to-split-dates-between-first-half-of-the-month1-to-15-and-second) on stack overflow but most use CTEs which I don't fully understand (especially on how to apply it to a table).

Is there an easy way to essentially utilize a function to output my rows based on their dates into respective periods?

EDIT: I realize maybe using a simple CASE statement may work but am not sure how to then output a dynamic string entry to the newly output column.

rsb5es,Joins vs. Extra Fields: Trying to avoid redundancy,"(TL;DR: Need to know how to model a semi-redundant set of relationships)

I am redesigning a database application of mine (personal side-project) based on what I've recently learned in a formal DBMS class. I've already made a number of changes that are clearly improvements over the previous schema. But I have one area that I'm struggling with, and hope I can get some help on.

The application tracks reference material for my hobby. A reference can be a book, a magazine article/feature, a set of film photos, a DVD/CD ROM full of photos, etc. Things like that. The problem is with books.

A `Reference` has the basic fields that all ref-types have in common: `id`, `name`, `language`, and timestamps. A `Book` has three additional properties: `isbn`, `publisher`, `series`, and `series_number`. (It also has a foreign key reference to the related `Reference` record.) Based on what I've recently learned, it would be wise to have the publisher be a separate entity with a FK reference to it in the `Book` entity. That would prevent the information on a publisher from being lost if the last book from that publisher is deleted.

However (and where the confusion comes in), while all books (theoretically) have a publisher, not all are a part of a series. So having the `series` and `series_number` in the `Book` schema would be wasteful. Plus, as far as `series` goes, having that in `Book` brings the same issue as having `publisher` in `Book`. So my design was to have `Book`, `Publisher`, and `Series` all be separate entities. I would use a FK relation to map `Publisher` to book and a relation table to map those books that are in a series to the relevant `Series` (the table records would both associate book to series and store the series number of the book).

BUT! A series is also linked to a specific publisher. I have more than one different series in my collection titled ""Aircraft in Detail"", and I have to know the publisher to distinguish them. So `Series` also needs a FK relation into `Publisher`. But now, the publisher information is redundant for a book; I can get it either directly through the FK on `Book`, or indirectly through the FK on `Series`. And this feels like a bad design smell.

What would be the most sensible way of approaching this? Given that a `Book` instance will only ever be linked to one `Publisher` and possibly one `Series`?",7,4,rjray,2021-12-30 20:20:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/rsb5es/joins_vs_extra_fields_trying_to_avoid_redundancy/,0,learnsql

rbs6ac,Dynamic SQL OpenQuery Help Request,"Hi,

I have am trying to update a table (Table\_Acopy) every day with the new data rather than truncate/drop and reimporting the data through OpenQuery. The OpenQuery is the bottleneck.

Table\_A/Table\_Acopy have the following structure:

|Item#|Code|Value|...|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|11111|Color|Blue|...|
|11111|Length|4 inch|...|
|22222|Diameter|1 inch|...|

Since Table\_Acopy is a copy of a table from a different server, an efficient way to keep it up to date without a daily truncate and reimport could be to only delete and reimport the rows that have been recently changed. However, this requires each row to have a time stamp.

The problem is that this time stamp is in another table, let's call it Table\_B. Table\_B has the following structure:

|Item#|Code|Prev Value|LastChangeDate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|11111|Color|Red|12/08/2021|
|11111|Length|3 inch|12/08/2021|
|33333|Shape|spherical|12/07/2021|

My plan is:

1.) OpenQuery pull all data from Table\_B with a LastChangeDate >= the last date I updated the tables (aka ran stored procedure).

2.) Use distinct Item#s from Table\_B (could be slightly more efficient and also use the Codes along with Item#, but this is least of my worries) and delete all rows in Table\_Acopy with these Item#s.

3.) **This step is the problem.** OpenQuery all the rows with just those distinct Item#s used in Step 2 and add these to the Table\_Acopy with a FULL OUTER JOIN.

I do not know how to dynamically find all the rows from a table with a value in a list through OpenQuery. I know how to dynamically use LastSPRunDate to only pull the new data in OpenQuery, but not with a list. Below is my attempt:

    DROP TABLE Table_Bcopy
    
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sysobjects WHERE name='Table_Bcopy' and xtype='U')
    	CREATE TABLE Table_Bcopy(
                Item# varchar(5)
            )
    
    INSERT INTO Table_Bcopy(Item#)
    VALUES ('11111'),
    		('11111'),
    		('33333')
    
    
    --DECLARE @TestList varchar(10)
    --SET @TestList = (SELECT DISTINCT Item# FROM Table_Bcopy)
    --PRINT(@TestList)
    
    
    DECLARE @TSQL varchar(8000)
    
    SET @TSQL = 'SELECT *
                FROM OPENQUERY(ServerName,''SELECT * FROM DataBase.Table_A
    			                           WHERE Item# in ' + (SELECT DISTINCT Item# FROM Table_Bcopy) + ''')'
    EXEC(@TSQL)

\*Note: Table\_Bcopy is just the newly changed rows, not the entire Table\_B.

\*Other Note: The server is an AS/400

I think ""(SELECT DISTINCT Item# FROM Table\_Bcopy)"" is the problem, but I don't know what to do instead. The error I keep getting is ""Subquery returned more than 1 value. This is not permitted when the subquery follows =, !=, <, <= , >, >= or when the subquery is used as an expression.""

q54n1p,How to add a column based on a set condition?,"
I have some invoice deals data and what I would like to do is add an indicator column to give me an idea if a certain deal has been reloaded for the same supplier, same invoice description and same value on another deal_id.
 
E.g

Deal_id
Supplier_name
Invoice description
Value
Status 
Possibly_Reloaded (‘Y’ or N’)
Related_deal

Say I had two deals (deal 1 and 2) and they had the same invoice description, same value but one stated cancelled and the other invoiced in the status col. 

How would I add a ‘Y’ indicator in a new col (possibly_reloaded) to the cancelled deal to suggest to me that it has been possibly reloaded again on another deal?  Ideally, populate with Y if there is another deal with the same invoice description and value. 

it would also be good if I could bring that reloaded deal_id into another column called related_deal.

q0hlii,Opinion on a database design,"Hi all,

I recently started learning SQL and decided to create my first database from scratch. The database will contain the history of my Spotify played songs along with some data about the tracks, albums and the artist.

I came with the following scheme - does it look okay? What improvements should I implement? Also, I think I might have used the incorrect symbols for the relation between tables, but I'm not really sure.

The thing I struggled the most with is the one to many relationships between the artists and the genres (one artist can be described with multiple genres). Is this a correct implementation?

oqmyf8,A method to cluster records in groups of three?,"Hi,

For a few years my wife and I have played 3 games of Rummikub every evening.

I have logged the results for the last 300 games (or 100 evenings) using various metrics (who played the first wildcard for example) to get stats as an academic exercise.

Sometimes I might win all three games and other times, she might, though these ""grand slam"" events are rare (see the sample table below). 

I want to find a way to check the records (added sequentially) to check the winner of each group of three to count the number of grand slam wins each. In the illustration below, on the 8th evening (or games 22 to 24), my wife won all three games and the 3rd evening (games 7 to 9) I did. 

I keep the data on a spreadsheet and import into My Sql and now need a query to parse the records in groups of three to see if there was a common winner. Any suggestions or questions?

Just to confirm - this is not to find who won any three consecutive games but who won three games in a single evening.

lwo0d1,Will learning SQL be useful for a health sciences student?,"Hi,
I’m a student in health sciences and was wondering if learning SQL might be worth it.
Typical problems I deal with is gathering data about many variables across a certain time frame, and then use excel to transform this data to a format suitable to work with in R, using excel, which is sometimes a bit annoying to deal with because I find excel a bit clunky and unwieldy.

But these datasets I deal with generally aren’t dynamic, so there is not a lot of writing to be done once the table is set up.

So I was wondering if SQL might have the tools to make this process of manipulating thousands of rows of excel data easier, or if my efforts might be better spent just trying to get more used to excel?

(I have a bit of background in C++, python and R from my old engineering days, but it’s mostly very abstract, like implementing sorting algorithms and calculating their efficiency and all that, also I do wish to study a bit of machine learning in the future since I’m intrigued by it and it may have many applications on health sciences)

    df.to_sql('state_schools', con=conn, if_exists='append', index=False)

That's what it looks like now when I export it to the sql database. My problem is that next time I run the program, it doubles up all the fields. I only want it to add new fields. Maybe it has to do with the 'if\_exists' part, but I thought that only checked if the table existed, not if the record existed.

I think I need a primary key, but maybe not. The excel file has several columns but the two important ones are State\_Name and Job\_Field. There's like 50 something values under State\_Name(it includes territories and such), and like 700 different values under Job\_Field. Each state has a seperate record for each job field. So for example, Alabama has 1 of each Job Field(Accounting, Actor, Actuaries, etc) , Alaska has 1 of each of those job fields as well, so neither field is really unique to make the primary key. The Job\_Field column is unique to the State\_Name column though. Would that make it a foreign key? I think that needs two tables though so I don't think that's what I'm looking for.

My thought(that I don't know how to write) is that I can loop through the state column, and then loop through each field column.  Check if  the state exists in the State\_Name column, if not then add it. If it does exist, check if the Job exists in the Job\_Field column, if not then add it. I dunno if that makes sense, but figured I'd ask here while I'm googling more options.",7,1,5oco,2021-02-22 18:45:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/lpwats/can_i_make_a_primary_key_that_depends_on_another/,0,learnsql

jxs12s,Need ideas on how to associate certain ticket information in multiple tables.,"This is kind of a complex issue I've been working on the last few weeks. I've tried to resolve it on my own and have some ideas on how to handle this, but it needs refinement. 

So I need to create a query that will only return information under certain conditions. An employee is assigned to a ticket and can have a role. If an employee is assigned to a certain ticket, it will return ticket name, ticket number, ticket subject (content of the ticket), and ticket date. This information is listed in a ticket details table. The employee must be part of a specific role which is listed in the staff table. 

However, right now, the query displays every ticket that was approved. I only want the tickets that were approved if the user was assigned directly to the ticket. 

select distinct  tid.C_TICKET_NUMBER, tid.C_TICKET_NAME, tid.C_TICKET_SUBJECT, tid.C_TIC_APPROVED
FROM T_Ticket_Details tid
left join T_Ticket_Staff ts on ts.c_employee = tid.c_created_by_id
WHERE (ts.C_ROLE = '5') OR (ts.C_ROLE = '6') 

The query results in a lot of entries right now which is not what I want. I am trying to limit the query output but trying to single out the query to only show a ticket the user is assigned to (according to role)  is what has me stumped. 

More information on the tables: 

Table Ticket Details contains the following columns which may be useful: c_Created_By (username), C_Created_By_ID, c_Created_Date, c_TICKET_NUMBER, C_Ticket_Name, C_SUBJECT

jwlgx4,How to set a scalar variable using a SQL select?,"There's a table with a specific cell I want to select and assign to an INT variable. What would the syntax be for that?

If I wanted to select the '73' data value, could I do something like...

    DECLARE @data_value INT = SELECT data FROM Foo WHERE id = 3

hpv15j,HELP Wanted - Writing SQL Code to Answer Qs Using W3 Schools,"Good morning!
I am very new to SQL and currently taking a course in the language. I have to use W3Schools to write SQL code to answer the questions below and I am absolutely stumped and I am hoping some of you may be able to help write the necessary code to obtain the answers.

Link to W3 Schools Datasets: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all

Questions:
Question 6: Which country had the most orders in 1996?
Question 7: Which supplier generated the most revenue in 1997?
Question 8: Which is the most common shipper?
Question 9: Which city had the most orders delivered to it?
Question 10: List the employees with no orders

PLEASE NOTE: This is only the 2nd week of the course so all we have been “taught” are basic commands, manipulations, queries, aggregate functions, and joins thus the codes should be very basic. I accomplished the first half of the questions fine but I am stuck in how to combine joins with aggregate functions which are the types of code needed to answer these questions.

The best code I’ve come up with for Question 6 is this:
SELECT COUNT(*), Orders.CustomerID, Customers.Country
FROM Orders
JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
WHERE Orders.OrderDate LIKE '%1996%'
GROUP BY Customers.Country;

But that is not giving the correct answer to the question thus it is not the right code. As for Q8, although it seems like a straight forward code:
SELECT ShipperID, COUNT (*)
FROM Orders
GROUP BY ShipperID;

It is not, I have to join the shipper data with I believe the Orders Data and then count so I get the Shipper Name rather than the ShipperID.

I need to provide both, the code and the answer to the question for the assignment, the code being the most important part. Any help anyone can provide will be truly appreciated.",7,11,Wondering7891,2020-07-12 14:14:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/hpv15j/help_wanted_writing_sql_code_to_answer_qs_using/,0,learnsql

Select Distinct doesn't work to remove them, because it looks at the entire row of fields to determine uniqueness, so if I have Customer ID #12345 who has an address on one row, but another row with Customer ID #12345 that has a null value in the address field, it will pull them both, because the rows are not identical.

gt1yh9,Generating single rows from aggregated data without access to FOR loops....FML,"I've finally cracked so I am looking to the hive mind to help with a situation that I have very likely over complicated. We're going to be working with theoretical information here so bear with me. Also before I outline the questions I need to say that I am running on MariaDB Version 10.2.X and therefore don't have access to FOR loops which would have made this SOOOOO much simpler.

I have a calendar table which lists all dates from 1/1/1900 to 12/31/2500...don't ask me why I chose those dates...it is what it is at this point. lets say it's a single column called dates.

I have a customer table that lists ""payment"" information and is formed with the following:

&#x200B;

|customer\_id|start\_date|end\_date|monthly\_payment|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|2016-01-13|2016-04-13|126.82|
|2|2016-12-25|2017-02-25|224.25|
|3|2020-04-15|NULL|94.57|

The actual dates and payments don't really matter here, this is just an example of an outline.

Anyway, what I would like to do is use \`calendar.dates\` and ""create"" a row for each payment that a customer would have made....to be clear, \`customer.monthly\_payment\` above is calculated based on receipt totals and terms and such so there is no actual record of these monthly payments. What I would like to end up with is a table that looks like the following.

&#x200B;

|customer\_id|payment\_date|payment\_amount|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|2016-01-13|126.82|
|1|2016-02-13|126.82|
|1|2016-03-13|126.82|
|1|2016-04-13|126.82|
|2|2016-12-25|224.25|
|2|2017-01-25|224.25|
|2|2017-02-25|224.25|
|3|2020-04-15|94.57|
|3|2020-05-15|94.57|

etc....

Like I said, I think I have over-complicated this in my head as I have a query that is like currently 300 lines and several sub-queries and I just think there is a better way than a bunch of if() statements.

This is kind of my last hope to do this within SQL before I throw my hands up and just attack it with python...which is likely another mess as I continue to self-teach.

el8val,Need a review for my relational database schema,"Hello everyone,

after a long time I have to relearn most relational database topics. At the moment I'm creating ER models to get a better overview and to understand the normalization process better.

It would be awesome if someone can review a model for me and give me some feedback.

Cheers

Edit 3: I've deleted the old model and the old description for an enhanced and much clearer diagram. Also provided a lot more information.

Below is the schema.

The scenario:

This schema represents a darts database. The organizer organizes events. Every event has one organizer but the organizer can have several events. Each dart event has different disciplines like 501 points, 301 points and so on. The conjunction table has also a boolean field to distinguish if it's an official league match or just a friendly game. Every event can have official AND unofficial disciplines. Therefore it's an m:n relationship.  
Every event has also several categories. These categories can be something like indoor, outdoor or e-darts.

I'm still not sure if the representation might be fine

However, one of the queries constantly takes a long time to run, and I want to figure out what the best way to resolve this is. I am in the finance department at my employer, so SQL query tuning is not really what I do day to day, but I am trying to learn.

The execution plan is here:

[https://www.brentozar.com/pastetheplan/?id=r1GrPy-0S](https://www.brentozar.com/pastetheplan/?id=r1GrPy-0S)

I can see the execution plan is asking me to add some indexes, but I am not sure if I should do that or not. I have read that the SQL hints should not be followed blindly, as it could cause other issues

The query is :

    SELECT mxmservcallaudit.jobid, 
           mxmservcallaudit.dataareaid, 
           mxmservcallaudit.date AS maxdate, 
           UPPER(mxmservcallaudit.USERID) AS maxuser
    FROM mxmservcallaudit
         INNER JOIN(SELECT jobid, 
                           dataareaid, 
                           MAX(RECID) AS maxrecid
                    FROM mxmservcallaudit
                    WHERE type = 9 AND dataareaid = 'ansa'
                    GROUP BY dataareaid, jobid) 
                    AS statusdate1 ON mxmservcallaudit.DATAAREAID = statusdate1.DATAAREAID AND 
                                                      MXMSERVCALLAUDIT.RECID = statusdate1.maxrecid;

And the missing index warnings are :

    Missing Index (Impact 41.2086): CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [<Name of Missing Index, sysname,>] ON 
    [dbo].[MXMSERVCALLAUDIT] ([TYPE],[DATAAREAID]) INCLUDE ([JOBID],[RECID])

    [dbo].[MXMSERVCALLAUDIT] ([DATAAREAID],[RECID]) INCLUDE ([JOBID],[USERID],[DATE])

All help most appreciated

Edit: After adding the two indexes as suggested by SQL, this has halved query execution time, and I now have a new execution plan, which is below:

•	Each sales office is assigned one or more employees. Attributes of employee include Employee_ID (identifier/key) and Employee_Name. An employee must be assigned to only one sales office. 


•	For each sales office, there is always one employee assigned to manage that office. An employee may manage only the sales office to which he/she is assigned. 


•	The firm lists property for sale. Attributes of property include Property_ID (iden¬tifier) and Location. Components of Location include Address, City, State, and Zip_Code. 


•	Each unit of property must be listed with one (and only one) of the sales offices. A sales office may have any number of properties listed, or may have no proper¬ties listed. 


•	Each unit of property has one or more owners. Attributes of owners are Owner_ID (identifier) and Owner_Name. An owner may own one or more units of property. An attribute of the association between property and owner is Percent_Owned. 
 

My diagram:

So before I proceed, I wonder if I correctly represented these requirements in my ER?

Next, using (still learning) Oracle Sql Developer, I tried to transfer these into tangible database objects, and I have the following questions:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vOMOliq7pv5IrAT8pnEFvJokcNu3G1Av/view?usp=sharing


1. How is a multivalue field represented in a table object? Is it a separate table called ""Location"".

2. How do you represent optional tables? Is this done by making the primary key nullable?

3. In my relationship between the office and the employee, how am i supposed to translate this sort of double connection? I thought it would be to create a foreign key of the sub table to reflect the requirements above. (One office, many employees, one of which is a manager)

4. Many to many is resolved as a linking table, correct? Though, does it connect exclusively to the linking table, or it also connects to the final sub table as it is in my object model.


Thanks in advance!

I am being encouraged to learn SQL, and would like some advice on courses that are available for beginners within the UK.

When I say beginner, I have never compiled SQL nor do I understand it, I can just about create Access Databases but this is fully self taught. 

I have looked at some local institutes and found something called an MTA but unsure if this is going to cover the knowledge I need, I can see it leads into a MCSA... 

I am looking at something short term that can run alongside my work or that work can send me to for 1-2weeks etc.

But I don't know how they expect me to solve problems to which I haven't even learned the associated commands yet? I just basically googled the answer to this.

Would it be easier to use Python for this? The specific app used is HeidiSQL btw.

I am just beginning to learn coding and am not necessarily looking for the best way to create this histogram, but just need to get the task done and create the histogram with the easiest method (I want to learn to learn how to code well but to initially I'd just like to complete my internship related tasks).

1ad4ann,What Is the Best SQL Playground for Teaching SQL,"Hello,
I'm starting a series of videos and posts called Intuitive SQL that aims to teach SQL a little differently. While I believe learners should use their own data instead of following a tutorial, that isn't realistic for those just starting out. This means I need to provide an environment to practice. 


There are many options out there, but I'd love your help in finding the best solution. The most important feature is the ability for me to create a public db anyone can query.  So far, I've considered. 

SQL Fiddle/DB Fiddle

* Well known
* Online editor
* Very simple to use
* No table browsing
* Requires create statements instead of creating a database everyone can use

Dolthub

* Well known
* Allows collaboration on the DB itself
* Online and offline query ability (web app or CLI)
* Some learning curve to get started

Docker/Postgres

* Ultimate flexibility
* Requires Docker and SQL Client install 
* A lot of work before any learning comes up
* Allows more advanced topics about DBMS management (Probably will not happen)

BigQuery public tables
* Good online editor
* Good schema representation
* Requires Google Cloud signup (Which isn't very intutive)

I'm leaning toward Dolthub, but BigQuery is compelling. I already have public tables anyone can query. What do you all think? What is the best environment for learners to follow along and practice using the same data as the blogs and videos?",4,5,leogodin217,2024-01-28 14:51:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/1ad4ann/what_is_the_best_sql_playground_for_teaching_sql/,0,learnsql
19a3y94,Newbie questions about subqueries,"Hi all,

I'm a beginner here with SQL trying to learn the ropes, so I apologize about my ignorance. I'm going through the google data analytics course on the subject of subqueries.

They used this working example in the course to demonstrate a subquery:

    SELECT
      station_id,
      num_bikes_available,
      (SELECT AVG(num_bikes_available)
      FROM bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_stations) AS avg_num_bikes
    FROM bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_stations

I don't quite understand the purpose of the nested subquery when it's within the same dataset/table. I thought to myself maybe I could just add a third select clause that used the AVG function. Such as below:

    SELECT
      station_id,
      num_bikes_available,
      AVG(num_bikes_available) AS avg_num_bikes
    FROM bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_stations

This doesn't work and throws the following error - ""SELECT list expression references column station\_id which is neither grouped nor aggregated at \[2:3\]""

tldr: Does anyone know why the top example works but the bottom example doesn't? ",6,3,skinnnymike,2024-01-18 23:14:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/19a3y94/newbie_questions_about_subqueries/,0,learnsql

Question! I know SQL Viewpoint allows you to use a Script to run queries and send them to an email address, one Excel file per email.
