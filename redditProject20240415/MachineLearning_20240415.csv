hiv3vf,[D] The machine learning community has a toxicity problem,"It is omnipresent!

**First** of all, the peer-review process is *broken*. Every fourth NeurIPS submission is put on arXiv. There are DeepMind researchers publicly going after reviewers who are criticizing their ICLR submission. On top of that, papers by well-known institutes that were put on arXiv are accepted at top conferences, despite the reviewers agreeing on rejection. In contrast, vice versa, some papers with a majority of accepts are overruled by the AC. (I don't want to call any names, just have a look the openreview page of this year's ICRL).

**Secondly,** there is a *reproducibility crisis*. Tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice nowadays. Papers that do not beat the current state-of-the-art method have a zero chance of getting accepted at a good conference. As a result, hyperparameters get tuned and subtle tricks implemented to observe a gain in performance where there isn't any.

**Thirdly,** there is a *worshiping* problem. Every paper with a Stanford or DeepMind affiliation gets praised like a breakthrough. For instance, BERT has seven times more citations than ULMfit. The Google affiliation gives so much credibility and visibility to a paper. At every ICML conference, there is a crowd of people in front of every DeepMind poster, regardless of the content of the work. The same story happened with the Zoom meetings at the virtual ICLR 2020. Moreover, NeurIPS 2020 had twice as many submissions as ICML, even though both are top-tier ML conferences. Why? Why is the name ""neural"" praised so much? Next, Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun are truly deep learning pioneers but calling them the ""godfathers"" of AI is insane. It has reached the level of a cult.

**Fourthly**, the way Yann LeCun talked about biases and fairness topics was insensitive. However, the *toxicity* and backlash that he received are beyond any reasonable quantity. Getting rid of LeCun and silencing people won't solve any issue.

**Fifthly**, machine learning, and computer science in general, have a huge *diversity problem*. At our CS faculty, only 30% of undergrads and 15% of the professors are women. Going on parental leave during a PhD or post-doc usually means the end of an academic career. However, this lack of diversity is often abused as an excuse to shield certain people from any form of criticism.  Reducing every negative comment in a scientific discussion to race and gender creates a toxic environment. People are becoming afraid to engage in fear of being called a racist or sexist, which in turn reinforces the diversity problem.

**Sixthly**, moral and ethics are set *arbitrarily*. The U.S. domestic politics dominate every discussion. At this very moment, thousands of Uyghurs are put into concentration camps based on computer vision algorithms invented by this community, and nobody seems even remotely to care. Adding a ""broader impact"" section at the end of every people will not make this stop. There are huge shitstorms because a researcher wasn't mentioned in an article. Meanwhile, the 1-billion+ people continent of Africa is virtually excluded from any meaningful ML discussion (besides a few Indaba workshops).

**Seventhly**, there is a cut-throat publish-or-perish *mentality*. If you don't publish 5+ NeurIPS/ICML papers per year, you are a looser. Research groups have become so large that the PI does not even know the name of every PhD student anymore. Certain people submit 50+ papers per year to NeurIPS. The sole purpose of writing a paper has become to having one more NeurIPS paper in your CV. Quality is secondary; passing the peer-preview stage has become the primary objective.

**Finally**, discussions have become *disrespectful*. Schmidhuber calls Hinton a thief, Gebru calls LeCun a white supremacist, Anandkumar calls Marcus a sexist, everybody is under attack, but nothing is improved.

Albert Einstein was opposing the theory of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Einstein's_objections_to_quantum_mechanics). Can we please stop demonizing those who do not share our exact views. We are allowed to disagree without going for the jugular. 

The moment we start silencing people because of their opinion is the moment scientific and societal progress dies.

11sboh1,[D] Our community must get serious about opposing OpenAI,"OpenAI was founded for the explicit purpose of democratizing access to AI and acting as a counterbalance to the closed off world of big tech by developing open source tools.

They have abandoned this idea entirely.

Today, with the release of GPT4 and their direct statement that they will not release details of the model creation due to ""safety concerns"" and the competitive environment, they have created a precedent worse than those that existed before they entered the field. We're at risk now of other major players, who previously at least published their work and contributed to open source tools, close themselves off as well.

AI alignment is a serious issue that we definitely have not solved. Its a huge field with a dizzying array of ideas, beliefs and approaches. We're talking about trying to capture the interests and goals of all humanity, after all. In this space, the one approach that is horrifying (and the one that OpenAI was LITERALLY created to prevent) is a singular or oligarchy of for profit corporations making this decision for us. This is exactly what OpenAI plans to do.

I get it, GPT4 is incredible. However, we are talking about the single most transformative technology and societal change that humanity has ever made. It needs to be for everyone or else the average person is going to be left behind.

We need to unify around open source development; choose companies that contribute to science, and condemn the ones that don't.

14265di,Should r/MachineLearning join the reddit blackout to protest changes to their API?,"Hello there, r/MachineLearning,

Recently, Reddit has announced some [changes to their API](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api_update_continued_access_to_our_api_for/) that may have pretty serious impact on many of it's users.

[You may have already seen quite a few posts like these](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) across some of the other subreddits that you browse, so we're just going to cut to the chase.

# What's Happening

Third Party Reddit apps (such as Apollo, Reddit is Fun and others) are going to become ludicrously more expensive for it's developers to run, which will in turn either kill the apps, or result in a monthly fee to the users if they choose to use one of those apps to browse. Put simply, each request to Reddit within these mobile apps will cost the developer money. The developers of Apollo [were quoted around $2 million per month](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) for the current rate of usage. The only way for these apps to continue to be viable for the developer is if you (the user) pay a monthly fee, and realistically, this is most likely going to just outright kill them. **Put simply: If you use a third party app to browse Reddit, you will most likely no longer be able to do so, or be charged a monthly fee to keep it viable.**

In lieu of what's happening, [an open letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) has been released by the broader moderation community. Part of this initiative includes a potential subreddit blackout (meaning, the subreddit will be privatized) on June 12th, lasting 24-48 hours or longer. On one hand, this is great to hopefully make enough of an impact to influence Reddit to change their minds on this. On the other hand, we usually stay out of these blackouts, and we would rather not negatively impact usage of the subreddit.

We would like to give the community a voice in this. Is this an important enough matter that r/machinelearning should fully support the protest and blackout the subreddit on June 12th? Feel free to leave your thoughts and opinions below. 

Also, please use up/downvotes for this submission to make yourself heard: upvote: r/ML should join the protest, downvote: r/ML should not join the protest.",2623,217,BeatLeJuce,2023-06-06 06:22:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/14265di/should_rmachinelearning_join_the_reddit_blackout/,0,MachineLearning

Now forget all of that and read the deep learning book. Put tensorflow and pytorch on a Linux box and run examples until you get it. Do stuff with CNNs and RNNs and just feed forward NNs.

Once you do all of that, go on arXiv and read the most recent useful papers. The literature changes every few months, so keep up.

# But Why?

Like most men, I had the problem of too many women asking for my dick pics.

So I spent the last 2 years learning linear algebra, Bayesian statistics, and multivariable calculus so that I could finally keep up with the demand by generating thousands of fake penises with AI.

The above website features those thousands of penises, do with it what you will.

If you're curious about the machine learning, the training dataset consisted of 40k dick pics from Reddit. Specifically the subreddits: r/penis r/cock, r/dicks, r/averagepenis, r/MassiveCock, and r/tinydick to keep it well rounded.

I then cleaned the dataset by training a Mask R-CNN Model to segment out the penis, used PCA on the segment to find the tilt of the shaft, then rotated the image so the schlong was aligned with the vertical axis.

The images were then put into a [StyleGAN2 ](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2)model and trained for \~9 days on a TPUv3-8.

The dataset, in case you want to see what 42,273 dick pics look like is posted in the Github.

A recurrent neural network trained to draw dicks.

Demo: https://dickrnn.github.io/

GitHub: https://github.com/dickrnn/dickrnn.github.io/

This project is a fork of Google's [sketch-rnn demo](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/assets/sketch_rnn_demo/index.html). The methodology is described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03477), and the dataset used for training is based on [Quickdraw-appendix](https://github.com/studiomoniker/Quickdraw-appendix).

# Why?

From Studio Moniker's [Quickdraw-appendix](https://studiomoniker.com/projects/do-not-draw-a-penis) project:

*In 2018 Google open-sourced the [Quickdraw data set](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset). “The world's largest doodling data set”. The set consists of 345 categories and over 50 million drawings. For obvious reasons the data set was missing a few specific categories that people seem to enjoy drawing. This made us at Moniker think about the moral reality big tech companies are imposing on our global community and that most people willingly accept this. Therefore we decided to publish an appendix to the Google Quickdraw data set.*

I also believe that [“Doodling a penis is a light-hearted symbol for a rebellious act”](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/6/17/18681733/google-ai-doodle-detector-penis-protest-moniker-mozilla) and also “think our moral compasses should not be in the hands of big tech”.

Believe it or not, this algorithm already exists as early as iOS 14.3, hidden under obfuscated class names. After some digging and reverse engineering on the hidden APIs I managed to export its model (which is MobileNetV3) to ONNX and rebuild the whole NeuralHash algorithm in Python. You can now try NeuralHash even on Linux!

Source code: [https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX](https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX)

No pre-exported model file will be provided here for obvious reasons. But it's very easy to export one yourself following the guide I included with the repo above. You don't even need any Apple devices to do it.

Early tests show that it can tolerate image resizing and compression, but not cropping or rotations.

Hope this will help us understand NeuralHash algorithm better and know its potential issues before it's enabled on all iOS devices.

uyratt,"[D] I don't really trust papers out of ""Top Labs"" anymore","I mean, I trust that the numbers they got are accurate and that they really did the work and got the results. I believe those. It's just that, take the recent ""An Evolutionary Approach to Dynamic Introduction of Tasks in Large-scale Multitask Learning Systems"" paper. It's 18 pages of talking through this pretty convoluted evolutionary and multitask learning algorithm, it's pretty interesting, solves a bunch of problems. But two notes. 

One, the big number they cite as the success metric is 99.43 on CIFAR-10, against a SotA of 99.40, so woop-de-fucking-doo in the grand scheme of things.

Two, there's a chart towards the end of the paper that details how many TPU core-hours were used for just the training regimens that results in the final results. The sum total is 17,810 core-hours. Let's assume that for someone who doesn't work at Google, you'd have to use on-demand pricing of $3.22/hr. This means that these trained models cost $57,348. 

Strictly speaking, throwing enough compute at a general enough genetic algorithm will eventually produce arbitrarily good performance, so while you can absolutely read this paper and collect interesting ideas about how to use genetic algorithms to accomplish multitask learning by having each new task leverage learned weights from previous tasks by defining modifications to a subset of components of a pre-existing model, there's a meta-textual level on which this paper is just ""Jeff Dean spent enough money to feed a family of four for half a decade to get a 0.03% improvement on CIFAR-10.""

OpenAI is far and away the worst offender here, but it seems like everyone's doing it. You throw a fuckton of compute and a light ganache of new ideas at an existing problem with existing data and existing benchmarks, and then if your numbers are infinitesimally higher than their numbers, you get to put a lil' sticker on your CV. Why should I trust that your ideas are even any good? I can't check them, I can't apply them to my own projects. 

Is this really what we're comfortable with as a community? A handful of corporations and the occasional university waving their dicks at everyone because they've got the compute to burn and we don't? There's a level at which I think there should be a new journal, exclusively for papers in which you can replicate their experimental results in under eight hours on a single consumer GPU.",1681,262,MrAcurite,2022-05-27 05:46:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/uyratt/d_i_dont_really_trust_papers_out_of_top_labs/,1,MachineLearning

6l2esd,[D] Why can't you guys comment your fucking code?,"Seriously.

I spent the last few years doing web app development. Dug into DL a couple months ago. Supposedly, compared to the post-post-post-docs doing AI stuff, JavaScript developers should be inbred peasants. But every project these peasants release, even a fucking library that colorizes CLI output, has a catchy name, extensive docs, shitloads of comments, fuckton of tests, semantic versioning, changelog, and, oh my god, better variable names than `ctx_h` or `lang_hs` or `fuck_you_for_trying_to_understand`.

The concepts and ideas behind DL, GANs, LSTMs, CNNs, whatever – it's clear, it's simple, it's intuitive. The slog is to go through the jargon (that keeps changing beneath your feet - what's the point of using fancy words if you can't keep them consistent?), the unnecessary equations, trying to squeeze meaning from bullshit language used in papers, figuring out the super important steps, preprocessing, hyperparameters optimization that the authors, oops, failed to mention.

Sorry for singling out, but [look at this](https://github.com/facebookresearch/end-to-end-negotiator/blob/master/src/agent.py) - what the fuck? If a developer anywhere else at Facebook would get this code for a review they would throw up.

- Do you intentionally try to obfuscate your papers? Is pseudo-code a fucking premium? Can you at least try to give some intuition before showering the reader with equations?

- How the fuck do you dare to release a paper without source code?

- Why the fuck do you never ever add comments to you code?

- When naming things, are you charged by the character? Do you get a bonus for acronyms?

- Do you realize that OpenAI having needed to release a ""baseline"" TRPO implementation is a fucking disgrace to your profession?

- Jesus christ, who decided to name a tensor concatenation function `cat`?

13kfxzy,[D] Does anybody else despise OpenAI?," I  mean, don't get me started with the closed source models they have that were trained using the work of unassuming individuals who will never  see a penny for it. Put it up on Github they said. I'm all for  open-source, but when a company turns around and charges you for a  product they made with freely and publicly made content, while forbidding you from using the output to create competing models, that is where I  draw the line. It is simply ridiculous. 

Sam Altman couldn't be anymore predictable with his recent attempts to get the government to start regulating AI.

What  risks? The AI is just a messenger for information that is already out  there if one knows how/where to look. You don't need AI to learn how to  hack, to learn how to make weapons, etc. Fake news/propaganda? The  internet has all of that covered. LLMs are no where near the level of AI  you see in sci-fi. I mean, are people really afraid of text? Yes, I  know that text can sometimes be malicious code such as viruses, but  those can be found on github as well.  If they fall for this they might  as well shutdown the internet while they're at it.

He  is simply blowing things out of proportion and using fear to increase  the likelihood that they do what he wants, hurt the competition. I  bet he is probably teething with bitterness everytime a new huggingface  model comes out. The thought of us peasants being able to use AI  privately is too dangerous. No, instead we must be fed scraps while they  slowly take away our jobs and determine our future.

This  is not a doomer post, as I am all in favor of the advancement of AI.  However, the real danger here lies in having a company like OpenAI  dictate the future of humanity. I get it, the writing is on the wall;  the cost of human intelligence will go down, but if everyone has their  personal AI then it wouldn't seem so bad or unfair would it? Listen,  something that has the power to render a college degree that costs  thousands of dollars worthless should be available to the public. This  is to offset the damages and job layoffs that will come as a result of  such an entity. It wouldn't be as bitter of a taste as it would if you were replaced by it while still not being able to access it. Everyone should be able to use it as leverage, it is the only fair solution.

If  we don't take action now, a company like ClosedAI will, and they are  not in favor of the common folk. Sam Altman is so calculated to the  point where there were times when he seemed to be shooting OpenAI in the foot during his talk.  This move is to simply conceal his real intentions, to climb the ladder and take it with him. If he didn't include his company in his  ramblings, he would be easily read. So instead, he pretends to be scared of his own product, in an effort to legitimize his claim. Don't fall  for it.

They are slowly making a  reputation as one the most hated tech companies, right up there with  Adobe, and they don't show any sign of change. They have no moat,  othewise they wouldn't feel so threatened to the point where they would have to resort to creating barriers of entry via regulation. This only  means one thing, we are slowly catching up. We just need someone to  vouch for humanity's well-being, while acting as an opposing force to the  evil corporations who are only looking out for themselves. Question is,  who would be a good candidate?",1440,426,onesynthguy,2023-05-17 22:15:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/13kfxzy/d_does_anybody_else_despise_openai/,1,MachineLearning
wiqjxv,[D] The current and future state of AI/ML is shockingly demoralizing with little hope of redemption,"I recently encountered the PaLM (Scaling Language Modeling with Pathways) paper from Google Research and it opened up a can of worms of ideas I’ve felt I’ve intuitively had for a while, but have been unable to express – and I know I can’t be the only one. Sometimes I wonder what the original pioneers of AI – Turing, Neumann, McCarthy, etc. – would think if they could see the state of AI that we’ve gotten ourselves into. 67 authors, 83 pages, 540B parameters in a model, the internals of which no one can say they comprehend with a straight face, 6144 TPUs in a commercial lab that no one has access to, on a rig that no one can afford, trained on a volume of data that a human couldn’t process in a lifetime, 1 page on ethics with the same ideas that have been rehashed over and over elsewhere with no attempt at a solution – bias, racism, malicious use, etc. – for purposes that who asked for?

When I started my career as an AI/ML research engineer 2016, I was most interested in two types of tasks – 1.) those that most humans could do but that would universally be considered tedious and non-scalable. I’m talking image classification, sentiment analysis, even document summarization, etc. 2.) tasks that humans lack the capacity to perform as well as computers for various reasons – forecasting, risk analysis, game playing, and so forth. I still love my career, and I try to only work on projects in these areas, but it’s getting harder and harder.

This is because, somewhere along the way, it became popular and unquestionably acceptable to push AI into domains that were originally uniquely human, those areas that sit at the top of Maslows’s hierarchy of needs in terms of self-actualization – art, music, writing, singing, programming, and so forth. These areas of endeavor have negative logarithmic ability curves – the vast majority of people cannot do them well at all, about 10% can do them decently, and 1% or less can do them extraordinarily. The little discussed problem with AI-generation is that, without extreme deterrence, we will sacrifice human achievement at the top percentile in the name of lowering the bar for a larger volume of people, until the AI ability range is the norm. This is because relative to humans, AI is cheap, fast, and infinite, to the extent that investments in human achievement will be watered down at the societal, educational, and individual level with each passing year. And unlike AI gameplay which superseded humans decades ago, we won’t be able to just disqualify the machines and continue to play as if they didn’t exist.

Almost everywhere I go, even this forum, I encounter almost universal deference given to current SOTA AI generation systems like GPT-3, CODEX, DALL-E, etc., with almost no one extending their implications to its logical conclusion, which is long-term convergence to the mean, to mediocrity, in the fields they claim to address or even enhance. If you’re an artist or writer and you’re using DALL-E or GPT-3 to “enhance” your work, or if you’re a programmer saying, “GitHub Co-Pilot makes me a better programmer?”, then how could you possibly know? You’ve disrupted and bypassed your own creative process, which is thoughts -> (optionally words) -> actions -> feedback -> repeat, and instead seeded your canvas with ideas from a machine, the provenance of which you can’t understand, nor can the machine reliably explain. And the more you do this, the more you make your creative processes dependent on said machine, until you must question whether or not you could work at the same level without it.

When I was a college student, I often dabbled with weed, LSD, and mushrooms, and for a while, I thought the ideas I was having while under the influence were revolutionary and groundbreaking – that is until took it upon myself to actually start writing down those ideas and then reviewing them while sober, when I realized they weren’t that special at all. What I eventually determined is that, under the influence, it was impossible for me to accurately evaluate the drug-induced ideas I was having because the influencing agent the generates the ideas themselves was disrupting the same frame of reference that is responsible evaluating said ideas. This is the same principle of – if you took a pill and it made you stupider, would even know it? I believe that, especially over the long-term timeframe that crosses generations, there’s significant risk that current AI-generation developments produces a similar effect on humanity, and we mostly won’t even realize it has happened, much like a frog in boiling water. If you have children like I do, how can you be aware of the the current SOTA in these areas, project that 20 to 30 years, and then and tell them with a straight face that it is worth them pursuing their talent in art, writing, or music? How can you be honest and still say that widespread implementation of auto-correction hasn’t made you and others worse and worse at spelling over the years (a task that even I believe most would agree is tedious and worth automating).

Furthermore, I’ve yet to set anyone discuss the train – generate – train - generate feedback loop that long-term application of AI-generation systems imply. The first generations of these models were trained on wide swaths of web data generated by humans, but if these systems are permitted to continually spit out content without restriction or verification, especially to the extent that it reduces or eliminates development and investment in human talent over the long term, then what happens to the 4th or 5th generation of models? Eventually we encounter this situation where the AI is being trained almost exclusively on AI-generated content, and therefore with each generation, it settles more and more into the mean and mediocrity with no way out using current methods. By the time that happens, what will we have lost in terms of the creative capacity of people, and will we be able to get it back?

By relentlessly pursuing this direction so enthusiastically, I’m convinced that we as AI/ML developers, companies, and nations are past the point of no return, and it mostly comes down the investments in time and money that we’ve made, as well as a prisoner’s dilemma with our competitors. As a society though, this direction we’ve chosen for short-term gains will almost certainly make humanity worse off, mostly for those who are powerless to do anything about it – our children, our grandchildren, and generations to come.

If you’re an AI researcher or a data scientist like myself, how do you turn things back for yourself when you’ve spent years on years building your career in this direction? You’re likely making near or north of $200k annually TC and have a family to support, and so it’s too late, no matter how you feel about the direction the field has gone. If you’re a company, how do you standby and let your competitors aggressively push their AutoML solutions into more and more markets without putting out your own? Moreover, if you’re a manager or thought leader in this field like Jeff Dean how do you justify to your own boss and your shareholders your team’s billions of dollars in AI investment while simultaneously balancing ethical concerns? You can’t – the only answer is bigger and bigger models, more and more applications, more and more data, and more and more automation, and then automating that even further. If you’re a country like the US, how do responsibly develop AI while your competitors like China single-mindedly push full steam ahead without an iota of ethical concern to replace you in numerous areas in global power dynamics? Once again, failing to compete would be pre-emptively admitting defeat.

Even assuming that none of what I’ve described here happens to such an extent, how are so few people not taking this seriously and discounting this possibility? If everything I’m saying is fear-mongering and non-sense, then I’d be interested in hearing what you think human-AI co-existence looks like in 20 to 30 years and why it isn’t as demoralizing as I’ve made it out to be.

d7ad2y,"[D] Siraj Raval - Potentially exploiting students, banning students asking for refund. Thoughts?","I'm not a personal follower of Siraj, but this issue came up in a ML FBook group that I'm part of. I'm curious to hear what you all think.

It appears that Siraj recently offered a course ""Make Money with Machine Learning"" with a registration fee but did not follow through with promises made in the initial offering of the course. On top of that, he created a refund and warranty page with information regarding the course *after* people already paid. Here is a link to a WayBackMachine captures of u/klarken's documentation of Siraj's potential misdeeds: [case for a refund](https://web.archive.org/save/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/feedback.html), [discussion in course Discord](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923211614/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reference_messages.png), [\~1200 individuals in the course](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923211815/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/members.png), [Multiple Slack channel discussion, students hidden from each other](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923211940/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/multiple_slack_channels.png), [""Hundreds refunded""](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923212113/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hundreds_refunded.png)

According to Twitter threads, he has been banning anyone in his Discord/Slack that has been asking for refunds.

On top of this there are many Twitter threads regarding his behavior. A screenshot (bottom of post) of an account that has since been deactivated/deleted (he made the account to try and get Siraj's attention). Here is a Twitter WayBackMachine archive link of a search for the user in the screenshot: [https://web.archive.org/web/20190921130513/https:/twitter.com/search?q=safayet96434935&src=typed\_query](https://web.archive.org/web/20190921130513/https:/twitter.com/search?q=safayet96434935&src=typed_query). In the search results it is apparent that there are many students who have been impacted by Siraj.

UPDATE 1: Additional searching on Twitter has yielded many more posts, check out the tweets/retweets of these people: [student1](https://web.archive.org/save/https:/twitter.com/ReneeSLiu1) [student2](https://web.archive.org/web/20190921133155/https://twitter.com/Aravind56898077)

UPDATE 2: A user mentioned that I should ask a question on r/legaladvice regarding the legality of the refusal to refund and whatnot. I have done so [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d7gopa/independent_online_course_false_advertising_and/). It appears that per California commerce law (where the School of AI is registered) individuals have the right to ask for a refund for 30 days.

UPDATE 3: Siraj has replied to the post below, and on [Twitter](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922213957/https://twitter.com/sirajraval/status/1175864213916372992?s=09) (Way Back Machine capture)

UPDATE 4: Another student has shared their interactions via [this Imgur post](https://imgur.com/gallery/msAdqBn). And another recorded moderators actively suppressing any mentions of refunds [on a live stream](https://web.archive.org/save/https://imgur.com/a/o1TMRY2). [Here is an example](https://imgur.com/a/KhMV6Xo) of assignment quality, note that the assignment is to generate fashion designs not pneumonia prediction.

UPDATE5: Relevant Reddit posts: [Siraj response](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/d7vv1l/d_siraj_apologizes_and_promises_refunds_within_30/), [question about opinions on course two weeks before this](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/cp7kht/guys_what_do_you_think_about_siraj_ravals_new/ewnv00m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), [Siraj-Udacity relationship](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/d8nlqf/n_udacity_had_an_interventional_meeting_with/)

UPDATE6: The Register has [published a piece on the debacle](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/09/27/youtube_ai_star/), Coffezilla [posted a video on all of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jmBE4yPrOs)

UPDATE7: Example of blatant ripoff: GitHub user gregwchase [diabetic retinopathy](https://github.com/gregwchase/dsi-capstone), Siraj's [ripoff](https://web.archive.org/web/20190928160728/https://github.com/llSourcell/AI_in_Medicine_Clinical_Imaging_Classification)

UPDATE8: Siraj has a [new paper and it is plagiarized](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/dh2xfs/d_siraj_has_a_new_paper_the_neural_qubit_its/)

14kv1ym,"So long r/MachineLearning, it's been an interesting few years","Some of you may recognize me, most of you probably don't. I've been the most active moderator of r/MachineLearning for a few years now, but on June 30th I'll be deleting my Reddit account.

I pretty much exclusively used Apollo to moderate. It would notify me of any new post, which allowed me to moderate from anywhere, anytime. That's how I stayed on top of moderating such a large sub.

When I stepped back on my moderation efforts a few months ago, [the effects](https://old.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/110swn2/d_quality_of_posts_in_this_sub_going_down) were quite apparent to [many of you](https://old.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/115ez2r/deleted_by_user).

Of course, this is the internet, and each of you have your own subjective view on moderation. Just know that it is a very time consuming task that I did for free because I genuinely cared about the community.

If you want to join me, I'll be moving on to kbin where I'm a moderator for [m/machinelearning](https://kbin.social/m/machinelearning). Otherwise, this is my farewell.

P.S. I'm sure there will be some who are sympathetic and some who just have an axe to grind and will complain about anything. I'm not a piñata; there's no prize inside if you bash me, but if you just can't help yourself, then have at it. I'll be gone soon anyway.",1322,90,None,2023-06-28 00:52:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/14kv1ym/so_long_rmachinelearning_its_been_an_interesting/,0,MachineLearning
k3ygrc,[R] AlphaFold 2,"Seems like DeepMind just caused the ImageNet moment for protein folding.

Blog post isn't that deeply informative yet (paper is promised to appear soonish). Seems like the improvement over the first version of AlphaFold is mostly usage of transformer/attention mechanisms applied to residue space and combining it with the working ideas from the first version. Compute budget is surprisingly moderate given how crazy the results are. Exciting times for people working in the intersection of molecular sciences and ML :)

eesoav,"[N] 4 Months after Siraj was caught scamming he has still not refunded any victims based in India, Philippines, or any other countries with no legal recourse. He makes an apology video, and when his victims ask for their refund, his followers respond with ""Be kind. He's asking for your forgiveness""","This is fucking sick..

People based in India, the Philippines, and other countries that do not have the resources to go after Siraj legally are those who need the money the most. 200$ could be a months worth of salary, or several months. And the types of people who get caught up in the scams are those who genuinely looking to improve their financial situation and work hard for it. This is fucking **cruel**. 

I'm having a hard time believing Siraj's followers are that brainwashed. Most likely alt accounts controlled by Siraj.

It is related to a few previous popular posts on this subreddit with high upvotes, which prompted me to post this [story](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm/).

The **[story](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm/)** reports the details of a new leak of highly classified Chinese government documents reveals the operations manual for running the mass detention camps in Xinjiang and exposed the mechanics of the region’s system of mass surveillance.

**The [lead journalist](https://twitter.com/BethanyAllenEbr/status/1198663008152621057)'s summary of findings**

The China Cables represent the first leak of a classified Chinese government document revealing the inner workings of the detention camps, as well as the first leak of classified government documents unveiling the predictive policing system in Xinjiang.

The leak features classified intelligence briefings that reveal, in the government’s own words, how Xinjiang police essentially take orders from a massive “cybernetic brain” known as IJOP, which flags entire categories of people for investigation & detention.

These secret intelligence briefings reveal the scope and ambition of the government’s AI-powered policing platform, which purports to predict crimes based on computer-generated findings alone. The result? Arrest by algorithm.

**The article describe methods used for algorithmic policing**

The classified intelligence briefings reveal the scope and ambition of the government’s artificial-intelligence-powered policing platform, which purports to predict crimes based on these computer-generated findings alone. Experts say the platform, which is used in both policing and military contexts, demonstrates the power of technology to help drive industrial-scale human rights abuses.

“The Chinese [government] have bought into a model of policing where they believe that through the collection of large-scale data run through artificial intelligence and machine learning that they can, in fact, predict ahead of time where possible incidents might take place, as well as identify possible populations that have the propensity to engage in anti-state anti-regime action,” said Mulvenon, the SOS International document expert and director of intelligence integration. “And then they are preemptively going after those people using that data.”

In addition to the predictive policing aspect of the article, there are side [articles](https://qz.com/1755018/chinas-manual-for-uighur-detention-camps-revealed-in-data-leak/) about the entire ML stack, including how [mobile apps](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/how-china-targets-uighurs-one-by-one-for-using-a-mobile-app/) are used to target Uighurs, and also how the inmates are [re-educated](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50511063) once inside the concentration camps. The documents reveal how every aspect of a detainee's life is monitored and controlled.

*Note: My motivation for posting this story is to raise ethical concerns and awareness in the research community. I do not want to heighten levels of racism towards the Chinese research community (not that it may matter, but I am Chinese). See this [thread](https://redd.it/e10b5x) for some context about what I don't want these discussions to become.*

*I am aware of the fact that the Chinese government's policy is to integrate the state and the people as one, so accusing the party is perceived domestically as insulting the Chinese people, but I also believe that we as a research community is intelligent enough to be able to separate government, and those in power, from individual researchers. We as a community should keep in mind that there are many Chinese researchers (in mainland and abroad) who are not supportive of the actions of the CCP, but they may not be able to voice their concerns due to personal risk.*

**Edit** Suggestion from /u/DunkelBeard:

When discussing issues relating to the Chinese government, try to use the term CCP, Chinese Communist Party, Chinese government, or Beijing. Try *not* to use only the term *Chinese* or *China* when describing the government, as it may be misinterpreted as referring to the Chinese people (either citizens of China, or people of Chinese ethnicity), if that is not your intention. As mentioned earlier, conflating China and the CCP is actually a tactic of the CCP.",1127,194,sensetime,2019-11-26 02:09:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/e1r0ou/d_chinese_government_uses_machine_learning_not/,0,MachineLearning

fni5ow,[D] Why is the AI Hype Absolutely Bonkers,"**Edit 2:** Both the repo and the post were deleted. Redacting identifying information as the author has appeared to make rectifications, and it’d be pretty damaging if this is what came up when googling their name / GitHub (hopefully they’ve learned a career lesson and can move on). 

**TL;DR:** A PhD candidate claimed to have achieved 97% accuracy for coronavirus from chest x-rays. Their post gathered thousands of reactions, and the candidate was quick to recruit branding, marketing, frontend, and backend developers for the project. Heaps of praise all around. He listed himself as a Director of XXXX (redacted), the new name for his project. 

The accuracy was based on a training dataset of ~30 images of lesion / healthy lungs, sharing of data between test / train / validation, and code to train ResNet50 from a PyTorch tutorial.   Nonetheless, thousands of reactions and praise from the “AI | Data Science | Entrepreneur” community. 

**Original Post:**

I saw this post circulating on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6645711949554425856-9Dhm

Here, a PhD candidate claims to achieve great performance with “ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE” to predict coronavirus, asks for more help, and garners tens of thousands of views. The repo housing this ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE solution already has a backend, front end, *branding*, a README translated in 6 languages, and a call to spread the word for this wonderful technology. Surely, I thought, this researcher has some great and novel tech for all of this hype? I mean dear god, we have *branding*, and the author has listed himself as the *founder of an organization* based on this project. Anything with this much attention, with dozens of “AI | Data Scientist | Entrepreneur” members of LinkedIn praising it, must have some great merit, right? 

Lo and behold, we have ResNet50, from torchvision.models import resnet50, with its linear layer replaced. We have a training dataset of 30 images. This should’ve taken at MAX 3 hours to put together - 1 hour for following a tutorial, and 2 for obfuscating the training with unnecessary code. 

I genuinely don’t know what to think other than this is bonkers. I hope I’m wrong, and there’s some secret model this author is hiding? If so, I’ll delete this post, but I looked through the repo and (REPO link redacted) that’s all I could find. 

I’m at a loss for thoughts. Can someone explain why this stuff trends on LinkedIn, gets thousands of views and reactions, and gets loads of praise from “expert data scientists”? It’s almost offensive to people who are like ... actually working to treat coronavirus and develop real solutions. It also seriously turns me off from pursuing an MS in CV as opposed to CS.

Edit: It turns out there were duplicate images between test / val / training, as if ResNet50 on 30 images wasn’t enough already. 

He’s also posted an update signed as “Director of XXXX (redacted)”. This seems like a straight up sleazy way to capitalize on the pandemic by advertising himself to be the head of a made up organization, pulling resources away from real biomedical researchers.",1109,226,good_rice,2020-03-23 11:05:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/fni5ow/d_why_is_the_ai_hype_absolutely_bonkers/,1,MachineLearning

146ue8q,r/MachineLearning is joining the Reddit Blackout starting June 12th,"Hi folks,

At this point you all are probably well aware of the shenanigans Reddit has been pulling regarding their [announced API changes](https://old.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api_update_continued_access_to_our_api_for/). These changes [are forcing many third party apps to shutdown](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/), including [Apollo](https://old.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/), [Reddit is Fun](https://old.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/), [Sync](https://old.reddit.com/r/redditsync/comments/144jp3w/sync_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023/), [Narwhal](https://old.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/), and [many more](https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/144o0cs/its_not_just_apollo_other_reddit_apps_are/). Many of the mods here, including me, use one of these apps to help moderate the sub.

Furthermore, it's now clear that Reddit is not acting in good faith. This includes [falsely accusing the creator of Apollo of extortion](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk45rr/?context=3), [ignoring app developers](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk2pp3/) requests to communicate while [saying they are working devs](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk647a/), and [requiring devs who make accessibility-focused apps to do so for free](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk5jfh/)! This mirrors the philosophy they have for moderation: have unpaid volunteers provide millions of hours of unpaid labor for Reddit.

We [previously asked the community](https://old.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/14265di/should_rmachinelearning_join_the_reddit_blackout/) if we should join [the planned Reddit blackout](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) and the answer was a resounding yes. So, that's what we plan to do. We feel there are enough other platforms for machine learning discussion (Hacker News, Twitter, Mastodon, etc), that people can migrate there in the meantime until Reddit reassesses their latest policy decisions. We hope to see you all on the other side.

124eyso,[N] OpenAI may have benchmarked GPT-4’s coding ability on it’s own training data,"[GPT-4 and professional benchmarks: the wrong answer to the wrong question](https://aisnakeoil.substack.com/p/gpt-4-and-professional-benchmarks)

*OpenAI may have tested on the training data. Besides, human benchmarks are meaningless for bots.*

 **Problem 1: training data contamination**

To benchmark GPT-4’s coding ability, OpenAI evaluated it on problems from Codeforces, a website that hosts coding competitions. Surprisingly, Horace He pointed out that GPT-4 solved 10/10 pre-2021 problems and 0/10 recent problems in the easy category. The training data cutoff for GPT-4 is September 2021. This strongly suggests that the model is able to memorize solutions from its training set — or at least partly memorize them, enough that it can fill in what it can’t recall.

As further evidence for this hypothesis, we tested it on Codeforces problems from different times in 2021. We found that it could regularly solve problems in the easy category before September 5, but none of the problems after September 12.

In fact, we can definitively show that it has memorized problems in its training set: when prompted with the title of a Codeforces problem, GPT-4 includes a link to the exact contest where the problem appears (and the round number is almost correct: it is off by one). Note that GPT-4 cannot access the Internet, so memorization is the only explanation.",1006,135,Balance-,2023-03-28 05:57:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/124eyso/n_openai_may_have_benchmarked_gpt4s_coding/,0,MachineLearning

mocpgj,[P] Using PyTorch + NumPy? A bug that plagues thousands of open-source ML projects.,"Using NumPy’s random number generator with multi-process data loading in PyTorch causes identical augmentations unless you specifically set seeds using the worker\_init\_fn option in the DataLoader. I didn’t and this bug silently regressed my model’s accuracy.

How many others has this bug done damage to? Curious, I downloaded over a hundred thousand repositories from GitHub that import PyTorch, and analysed their source code. I kept projects that define a custom dataset, use NumPy’s random number generator with multi-process data loading, and are more-or-less straightforward to analyse using abstract syntax trees. Out of these, over 95% of the repositories are plagued by this problem. It’s inside PyTorch's official tutorial, OpenAI’s code, and NVIDIA’s projects. Even Karpathy admitted falling prey to it.

For example, the following image shows the duplicated random crop augmentations you get when you blindly follow the official PyTorch tutorial on custom datasets:

lcuq4b,[D] Anyone else find themselves rolling their eyes at a lot of mainstream articles that talk about “AI”?,"I’m not talking about papers, or articles from more scientific publications, but mainstream stuff that gets published on the BBC, CNN, etc. Stuff that makes it to Reddit front pages. 

There’s so much misinformation out there, it’s honestly nauseating. AI is doom and gloom nonsense ranging from racist AIs to the extinction of human kind. 

I just wish people would understand that we are so incomprehensibly far away from a true, thinking machine. The stuff we have now that is called “ai” are just fancy classification/regression models that rely on huge amounts of data to train. The applications are awesome, no doubt, but ultimately AI in its current state is just another tool in the belt of a researcher/engineer. AI itself is neither good, or bad, in the same way that a chainsaw is neither good or bad. It’s just another tool.  

Tldr: I rant about the misinformation regarding AI in its current state.",953,231,None,2021-02-05 00:30:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/lcuq4b/d_anyone_else_find_themselves_rolling_their_eyes/,0,MachineLearning
hzdiru,"[D] If you say in a paper you provide code, it should be required to be available at time of publication","TL;DR: The only thing worse than not providing code is saying you did and not following through.

I'm frustrated, so this might be a little bit of a rant but here goes: I cannot believe that it is acceptable in highly ranked conferences to straight-up lie about the availability of code. Firstly, obviously it would be great if everyone released their code all the time because repeatability in ML is pretty dismal at times. But if you're not going to publish your code, then don't say you are. Especially when you're leaving details out of the paper and referring the reader to said ""published"" code.

Take for example [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04725), coming out of NVIDIA's research lab and published in CVPR2020. It is fairly detail-sparse, and nigh on impossible to reproduce in its current state as a result. It refers the reader to [this repository](https://github.com/NVlabs/wetectron) which has been a single readme since its creation. It is simply unacceptable for this when the paper directly says the code has been released.

As top conferences are starting to encourage the release of code, I think there needs to be another component: the code must actually be available. Papers that link to empty or missing repositories within some kind of reasonable timeframe of publication should be withdrawn. It should be unacceptable to direct readers to code that doesn't exist for details, and similarly for deleting repositories shortly after publication. I get that this is logistically a little tough, because it has to be done after publication, but still we can't let this be considered okay

EDIT: To repeat the TL;DR again and highlight the key point - There won't always be code, that's frustrating but tolerable. There is no excuse for claiming to have code available, but not actually making it available. Code should be required to be up at time of publication, and kept up for some duration, if a paper wishes to claim to have released their code.",952,134,chatterbox272,2020-07-28 12:09:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hzdiru/d_if_you_say_in_a_paper_you_provide_code_it/,0,MachineLearning
1alxv3l,"[D] Off my chest. I'm doing PhD in ML, and I'm a failure."," I'm halfway through my ML PhD.

I was quite lucky and got into a good program, especially in a good lab where students are superstars and get fancy jobs upon graduation. I'm not one of them. I have one crappy, not-so-technical publication and I'm struggling to find a new problem that is solvable within my capacity. I've tried hard. I've been doing research throughout my undergrad and masters, doing everything I could – doing projects, reading papers, taking ML and math courses, writing grants for professors...

The thing is, I just can't reach the level of generating new ideas. No matter how hard I try, it just ain't my thing. I think why. I begin to wonder if STEM wasn't my thing in the first place. I look around and there are people whose brain simply ""gets"" things easier. For me, it requires extra hard working and extra time. During undergrad, I could get away with studying harder and longer. Well, not for PhD. Especially not in this fast-paced, crowded field where I need to take in new stuff and publish quickly.

I'm an imposter, and this is not a syndrome. I'm getting busted. Everybody else is getting multiple internship offers and all that. I'm getting rejected from everywhere. It seems now they know. They know I'm useless. Would like to say this to my advisor but he's such a genius that he doesn't get the mind of the commoner.

di2fez,[N] Netflix and European Space Agency no longer working with Siraj Raval,"*According to article in [The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/10/14/ravel_ai_youtube/)*:

A Netflix spokesperson confirmed to The Register it wasn’t working with Raval, and the ESA has cancelled the whole workshop altogether.

“The situation is as it is. The workshop is cancelled, and that’s all,” Guillaume Belanger, an astrophysicist and the INTEGRAL Science Operations Coordinator at the ESA, told The Register on Monday.

Raval isn’t about to quit his work any time soon, however. He promised students who graduated from his course that they would be referred to recruiters at Nvidia, Intel, Google and Amazon for engineering positions, or matched with a startup co-founder or a consulting client.

In an unlisted YouTube video recorded live for his students discussing week eight of his course, and seen by El Reg, he read out a question posed to him: “Will your referrals hold any value now?”

“Um, yeah they’re going to hold value. I don’t see why they wouldn’t. I mean, yes, some people on Twitter were angry but that has nothing to do with… I mean… I’ve also had tons of support, you know. I’ve had tons of support from people, who, uh, you know, support me, who work at these companies.

*He continues to justify his actions:*

“Public figures called me in private to remind me that this happens. You know, people make mistakes. You just have to keep going. They’re basically just telling me to not to stop. Of course, you make mistakes but you just keep going,” he claimed.

*When The Register asked Raval for comment, he responded:*

**I've hardly taken any time off to relax since I first started my YouTube channel almost four years ago. And despite the enormous amount of work it takes to release two high quality videos a week for my audience, I progressively started to take on multiple other projects simultaneously by myself – a book, a docu-series, podcasts, YouTube videos, the course, the school of AI. Basically, these past few weeks, I've been experiencing a burnout unlike anything I've felt before. As a result, all of my output has been subpar.**

**I made the [neural qubits] video and paper in one week. I remember wishing I had three to six months to really dive into quantum machine-learning and make something awesome, but telling myself I couldn't take that long as it would hinder my other projects. I plagiarized large chunks of the paper to meet my self-imposed one-week deadline. The associated video with animations took a lot more work to make. I didn't expect the paper to be cited as serious research, I considered it an additional reading resource for people who enjoyed the associated video to learn more about quantum machine learning. If I had a second chance, I'd definitely take way more time to write the paper, and in my own words.**

**I've given refunds to every student who's asked so far, and the majority of students are still enrolled in the course. There are many happy students, they're just not as vocal on social media. We're on week 8 of 10 of my course, fully committed to student success.**

“And, no, I haven't plagiarized research for any other paper,” he added.

vye69k,30% of Google's Reddit Emotions Dataset is Mislabeled [D],"Last year, Google released their Reddit Emotions dataset: a collection of 58K Reddit comments human-labeled according to 27 emotions. 

I analyzed the dataset... and found that a 30% is mislabeled!

Some of the errors:

1. **\*aggressively tells friend I love them\*** – mislabeled as **ANGER**
2. **Yay, cold McDonald's. My favorite.** – mislabeled as **LOVE**
3. **Hard to be sad these days when I got this guy with me** – mislabeled as **SADNESS**
4. **Nobody has the money to. What a joke** – mislabeled as **JOY**

&#x200B;

I wrote a blog about it here, with more examples and my main two suggestions for how to fix Google's data annotation methodology.

8midpw,[D] What is happening in this subreddit?,"I was not going to post this but something wrong is happening here in this subreddit which forced my hands.


This week two posts relating to machine learning were posted here one is about [How visual search works](https://thomasdelteil.github.io/VisualSearch_MXNet/) and other about [generating ramen](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8l5w56/p_generative_ramen/). The former post contains a small write up, source code and a demo site to explain how visual search works and the latter just have a gif of generated  ramen probably with a GAN. The irony is that the post which has more information and source code for reproducing that work got only about 25 votes and the one with gif only with no source code or explanation provided got more than 1000 votes (not so unique work any one with basic understanding of GAN can make one). Today the most upvoted post here is about [a circle generating GAN](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8mgs8k/p_visualisation_of_a_gan_learning_to_generate_a/) which also has only a gif with brief explanation as comment and no source code. Are you seeing a pattern here?

The problem I mentioned above is not a one of case, I am a regular lurker in this subreddit and for the past few months I started seeing some disturbing patterns in posts posted here. People who posts gif/movie/photo only post tends to get more upvotes than the posts with full source code or explanation.  I agree some original research posts [such as this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc5P2bvfl44&feature=youtu.be&t=7s) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y__pYj9UHfc) can be only be released as videos and not the source code because of its commercial value. But most of the gif/movie/photo only posts here are not at all original research but they used a already know algorithm with a different dataset (eg: Ramen generation). 

The problem here is If we continue this type of posts people will stop sharing their original works, source code or explanation and then starts sharing this type of end result only posts which will get less scrutiny and more votes. In future, this will not only decrease the quality of this subreddit but also its a greater danger to the open nature of Machine learning field. What's the point in posting a github project link or blogpost here when we can get much more votes with a gif alone?.

fkgfax,[D] Confessions from an ICML reviewer,"Welp, I realize that many of you are about to receive feedback in a couple weeks which will most likely be a reject from ICML. I realize that its difficult to stomach rejection, and I empathize with you as I'm submitting as well and will likely get a reject as well.

But please, please, please, please, as someone who has already spent 20-30 hours reviewing this week, and will likely be spending another 30-40 hours this week on the reviewing process. Please!

Stop submitting unfinished work to conferences.

At this point more than half of the papers I'm reviewing are clearly unfinished work. They have significant, unmistakable flaws to the point that no reasonable person can believe that this work could possibly appear in a peer reviewed, top tier conference. No reasonable person can put these submitted papers next to even the worst ICML paper from the last few years, and believe that yeah, they're of similar or higher quality.

Please take the time to get your work reviewed by your peers, or even your advisor prior to submission. If they can find \*any\* flaw in your work, I assure you, your reviewers are going to find so many flaws and give you a hurtful, and demoralizing review.

I realize that we're all in a huge hype bubble, and we all want to ride the hype train, but reviewing these unfinished works makes me feel so disrespected by the authors. They're clearly submitting for early feedback. It's not fair to the conference system and the peer review process to ask your reviewers to do \*unpaid\* research work for you and advise you on how to construct and present your work. It's not fair to treat your reviewers as free labor.

It takes me at a \*minimum\* 6-7 hours to review one paper, and more likely 10+ hours. That's 10+ hours of my life that these authors think is entitled to them to help them in their research so they can get published. It makes me feel so disrespected, and quite honestly, makes me want to give up on signing up as a reviewer if this is the quality of work I am expected to review.

Not only are these authors being selfish, but they're hurting the overall research community, conference quality, and the peer review process. More unfinished work being submitted, means reviewers have a higher workload. We don't get to spend as much time on each paper as we would like to, meaning \*good well written deserving papers\* either get overlooked, unfairly rejected, or get terrible feedback. This is simply unacceptable!

These authors, quite honestly, are acting like those people who hoard toilet paper during an epidemic. They act selfishly to the detriment of the community, putting themselves above both the research process, and other authors who submit good work.

Please, please, PLEASE don't do this. Submit finished, good work, that you think is ready for publication and peer review.

e03azf,[N] China forced the organizers of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) in South Korea to change Taiwan’s status from a “nation” to a “region” in a set of slides.,"Link: [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2019/11/02/2003725093](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2019/11/02/2003725093)

>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday protested after China forced the organizers of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) in South Korea to change Taiwan’s status from a “nation” to a “region” in a set of slides.  
>  
>At the opening of the conference, which took place at the COEX Convention and Exhibition Center in Seoul from Tuesday to yesterday, the organizers released a set of introductory slides containing graphics showing the numbers of publications or attendees per nation, including Taiwan.  
>  
>However, the titles on the slides were later changed to “per country/region,” because of a complaint filed by a Chinese participant.  
>  
>“Taiwan is wrongly listed as a country. I think this may be because the person making this chart is not familiar with the history of Taiwan,” the Chinese participant wrote in a letter titled “A mistake at the opening ceremony of ICCV 2019,” which was published on Chinese social media under the name Cen Feng (岑峰), who is a cofounder of leiphone.com.  
>  
>The ministry yesterday said that China’s behavior was contemptible and it would not change the fact that Taiwan does not belong to China.  
>  
>Beijing using political pressure to intervene in an academic event shows its dictatorial nature and that to China, politics outweigh everything else, ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou (歐江安) said in a statement.  
>  
>The ministry has instructed its New York office to express its concern to the headquarters of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which cosponsored the conference, asking it not to cave in to Chinese pressure and improperly list Taiwan as part of China’s territory, she said.  
>  
>Beijing has to forcefully tout its “one China” principle in the global community because it is already generally accepted that Taiwan is not part of China, she added.  
>  
>As China attempts to force other nations to accept its “one China” principle and sabotage academic freedom, Taiwan hopes that nations that share its freedoms and democratic values can work together to curb Beijing’s aggression, she added.",858,205,Only_Assist,2019-11-22 16:28:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/e03azf/n_china_forced_the_organizers_of_the/,0,MachineLearning

- - -

We have a [PhD level or Advanced courses](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/51qhc8/phdlevel_courses/) thread in the sidebar but it's three year old now. There were two other 7-8 month old threads ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cae59l/d_advanced_courses_update/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cjnund/d_what_are_your_favorite_videos_lectures_on/)) but they don't have many quality responses either. 

So, can we have a new one here?

To reiterate - CS231n, CS229, ones from Udemy etc are not advanced. 

Advanced ML/DL/RL, attempts at building theory of DL, optimization theory, advanced applications etc are some examples of what I believe should belong here, much like the original sidebar post.

You can also suggest (new) categories for the courses you share. :)

krkxog,[D] Let's start 2021 by confessing to which famous papers/concepts we just cannot understand.,"* **Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes  (Variational Autoencoder)**: I understand the main concept, understand the NN implementation, but just cannot understand this paper, which contains a theory that is much more general than most of the implementations suggest.
* **Neural ODE**: I have a background in differential equations, dynamical systems and have course works done on numerical integrations. The theory of ODE is extremely deep (read tomes such as the one by Philip Hartman), but this paper seems to take a short cut to all I've learned about it. Have no idea what this paper is talking about after 2 years. Looked on Reddit, a bunch of people also don't understand and have came up with various extremely bizarre interpretations.
* **ADAM:** this is a shameful confession because I never understood anything beyond the ADAM equations. There are stuff in the paper such as  signal-to-noise ratio, regret bounds, regret proof, and even another algorithm called AdaMax hidden in the paper. Never understood any of it. Don't know the theoretical implications.

I'm pretty sure there are other papers out there.

11ybjsi,[D] Overwhelmed by fast advances in recent weeks,"I was watching the GTC keynote and became entirely overwhelmed by the amount of progress achieved from last year.  I'm wondering how everyone else feels.

&#x200B;

Firstly, the entire ChatGPT, GPT-3/GPT-4 chaos has been going on for a few weeks, with everyone scrambling left and right to integrate chatbots into their apps, products, websites. Twitter is flooded with new product ideas, how to speed up the process from idea to product, countless promp engineering blogs, tips, tricks, paid courses.

&#x200B;

Not only was ChatGPT disruptive, but a few days later, Microsoft and Google also released their models and integrated them into their search engines. Microsoft also integrated its LLM into its Office suite. It all happenned overnight. I understand that they've started integrating them along the way, but still, it seems like it hapenned way too fast. This tweet encompases the past few weeks perfectly [https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508](https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508) , on a random Tuesday countless products are released that seem revolutionary.

&#x200B;

In addition to the language models, there are also the generative art models that have been slowly rising in mainstream recognition. Now Midjourney AI is known by a lot of people who are not even remotely connected to the AI space.

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks, reading Twitter, I've felt completely overwhelmed, as if the entire AI space is moving beyond at lightning speed, whilst around me we're just slowly training models, adding some data, and not seeing much improvement, being stuck on coming up with ""new ideas, that set us apart"".

&#x200B;

Watching the GTC keynote from NVIDIA I was again, completely overwhelmed by how much is being developed throughout all the different domains. The ASML EUV (microchip making system) was incredible, I have no idea how it does lithography and to me it still seems like magic. The Grace CPU with 2 dies (although I think Apple was the first to do it?) and 100 GB RAM, all in a small form factor. There were a lot more different hardware servers that I just blanked out at some point. The omniverse sim engine looks incredible, almost real life (I wonder how much of a domain shift there is between real and sim considering how real the sim looks). Beyond it being cool and usable to train on synthetic data, the car manufacturers use it to optimize their pipelines. This change in perspective, of using these tools for other goals than those they were designed for I find the most interesting.

&#x200B;

The hardware part may be old news, as I don't really follow it, however the software part is just as incredible. NVIDIA AI foundations (language, image, biology models), just packaging everything together like a sandwich. Getty, Shutterstock and Adobe will use the generative models to create images. Again, already these huge juggernauts are already integrated.

&#x200B;

I can't believe the point where we're at. We can use AI to write code, create art, create audiobooks using Britney Spear's voice, create an interactive chatbot to converse with books, create 3D real-time avatars, generate new proteins (?i'm lost on this one), create an anime and countless other scenarios. Sure, they're not perfect, but the fact that we can do all that in the first place is amazing.

&#x200B;

As Huang said in his keynote, companies want to develop ""disruptive products and business models"". I feel like this is what I've seen lately. Everyone wants to be the one that does something first, just throwing anything and everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I'm feeling like the world is moving so fast around me whilst I'm standing still. I want to not read anything anymore and just wait until everything dies down abit, just so I can get my bearings. However, I think this is unfeasible. I fear we'll keep going in a frenzy until we just burn ourselves at some point.

&#x200B;

How are you all fairing? How do you feel about this frenzy in the AI space? What are you the most excited about?",830,331,iamx9000again,2023-03-22 08:04:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11ybjsi/d_overwhelmed_by_fast_advances_in_recent_weeks/,0,MachineLearning

I recently wrote the ""Machine Learning with Pytorch and Scikit-Learn"" book and joined a startup(Grid.ai) in January. I am also an Assistant Professor of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison since 2018. Btw. I am also a very passionate Python programmer and love open source.

hkiyir,[R] Google has a credit assignment problem in research,"Google has some serious cultural problems with proper credit assignment. They continue to rename methods discovered earlier DESPITE admitting the existence of this work.

See this new paper they released:

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14536](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14536)

Stop calling this method SWISH; its original name is SILU. The original Swish authors from Google even admitted to this mistake in the past ([https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/773epu/r\_swish\_a\_selfgated\_activation\_function\_google/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/773epu/r_swish_a_selfgated_activation_function_google/)). And the worst part is this new paper has the very same senior author as the previous Google paper.

And just a couple weeks ago, the same issue again with the SimCLR paper. See thread here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hbzd5o/d\_on\_the\_public\_advertising\_of\_neurips/fvcet9j/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hbzd5o/d_on_the_public_advertising_of_neurips/fvcet9j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

They site only cite prior work with the same idea in the last paragraph of their supplementary and yet again rename the method to remove its association to the prior work. This is unfair. Unfair to the community and especially unfair to the lesser known researchers who do not have the advertising power of Geoff Hinton and Quoc Le on their papers.

SiLU/Swish is by Stefan Elfwing, Eiji Uchibe, Kenji Doya ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03118](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03118)).

Original work of SimCLR is by Mang Ye, Xu Zhang, Pong C. Yuen, Shih-Fu Chang ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03436](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03436))

Update:

Dan Hendrycks and Kevin Gimpel also proposed the SiLU non-linearity in 2016 in their work Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELUs) ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415))

Update 2:

""Smooth Adversarial Training"" by Cihang Xie is only an example of the renaming issue because of issues in the past by Google to properly assign credit. Cihang Xie's work is not the cause of this issue. Their paper does not claim to discover a new activation function. They are only using the SiLU activation function in some of their experiments under the name Swish. [Cihang Xie will provide an update of the activation function naming used in the paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hkiyir/r\_google\_has\_a\_credit\_assignment\_problem\_in/fwtttqo?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x) to reflect the correct naming. 

The cause of the issue is Google in the past decided to continue with renaming the activation as [Swish despite being made aware of the method already having the name SiLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05941). Now it is stuck in our research community and stuck in our ML libraries (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/41066).",825,126,Routine-Coffee8832,2020-07-03 13:22:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hkiyir/r_google_has_a_credit_assignment_problem_in/,0,MachineLearning

gj475j,[Project] This Word Does Not Exist,"Hello! I've been working on [this word does not exist](http://www.thisworddoesnotexist.com/). In it, I ""learned the dictionary"" and trained a GPT-2 language model over the Oxford English Dictionary. Sampling from it, you get realistic sounding words with fake definitions and example usage, e.g.:

>**pellum (noun)**  
>  
>the highest or most important point or position  
>  
>*""he never shied from the pellum or the right to preach""*

On the [website](http://www.thisworddoesnotexist.com/), I've also made it so you can prime the algorithm with a word, and force it to come up with an example, e.g.:

Most of the project was spent throwing a number of rejection tricks to make good samples, e.g.,

* Rejecting samples that contain words that are in the a training set / blacklist to force generation completely novel words
* Rejecting samples without the use of the word in the example usage
* Running a part of speech tagger on the example usage to ensure they use the word in the correct POS

eyg2hv,"[D] Does actual knowledge even matter in the ""real world""?","TL;DR for those who dont want to read the full rant. 

Spent hours performing feature selection,data preprocessing, pipeline building, choosing a model that gives decent results on all metrics and extensive testing only to lose to someone who used a model that was clearly overfitting on a dataset that was clearly broken, all because the other team was using ""deep learning"". Are buzzwords all that matter to execs?



I've been learning Machine Learning for the past 2 years now. Most of my experience has been with Deep Learning. 

Recently, I participated in a Hackathon. The Problem statement my team picked was ""Anomaly detection in Network Traffic using Machine Learning/Deep Learning"". Us being mostly a DL shop, thats the first approach we tried. We found an open source dataset about cyber attacks on servers, lo and behold, we had a val accuracy of 99.8 in a single epoch of a simple feed forward net, with absolutely zero data engineering....which was way too good to be true. Upon some more EDA and some googling we found two things, one, three of the features had a correlation of more than 0.9 with the labels, which explained the ridiculous accuracy, and two, the dataset we were using had been repeatedly criticized since it's publication for being completely unlike actual data found in network traffic. This thing (the name of the dataset is kddcup99, for those interested ) was really old (published in 1999) and entirely synthetic. The people who made it completely fucked up and ended up producing a dataset that was almost linear. 

To top it all off, we could find no way to extract over half of the features listed in that dataset, from real time traffic, meaning a model trained on this data could never be put into production, since there was no way to extract the correct features from the incoming data during inference.

We spent the next hour searching for a better source of data, even trying out unsupervised approaches like auto encoders, finally settling on a newer, more robust dataset, generated from real data (titled UNSW-NB15, published 2015, not the most recent my InfoSec standards, but its the best we could find). 
Cue almost 18 straight, sleepless hours of determining feature importance, engineering and structuring the data (for eg. we had to come up with our own solutions to representing IP addresses and port numbers, since encoding either through traditional approaches like one-hot was just not possible), iterating through different models,finding out where the model was messing up, and preprocessing data to counter that, setting up pipelines for taking data captures in raw pcap format, converting them into something that could be fed to the model, testing out the model one random pcap files found around the internet, simulating both postive and negative conditions (we ran port scanning attacks on our own machines and fed the data of the network traffic captured during the attack to the model), making sure the model was behaving as expected with a balanced accuracy, recall and f1_score, and after all this we finally built a web interface where the user could actually monitor their network traffic and be alerted if there were any anomalies detected, getting a full report of what kind of anomaly, from what IP, at what time, etc. 

After all this we finally settled on using a RandomForestClassifier, because the DL approaches we tried kept messing up because of the highly skewed data (good accuracy, shit recall) whereas randomforests did a far better job handling that. We had a respectable 98.8 Acc on the test set, and similar recall value of 97.6. We didn't know how the other teams had done but we were satisfied with our work. 

During the judging round, after 15 minutes of explaining all of the above to them, the only question the dude asked us was ""so you said you used a nueral network with 99.8 Accuracy, is that what your final result is based on?"". We then had to once again explain why that 99.8 accuracy was absolutely worthless, considering the data itself was worthless and how Neural Nets hadn't shown themselves to be very good at handling data imbalance (which is important considering the fact that only a tiny percentage of all network traffic is anomalous). The judge just muttered ""so its not a Neural net"", to himself, and walked away. 

We lost the competetion, but I was genuinely excited to know what approach the winning team took until i asked them, and found out ....they used a fucking neural net on kddcup99 and that was all that was needed. Is that all that mattered to the dude? That they used ""deep learning"". What infuriated me even more was this team hadn't done anything at all with the data, they had no fucking clue that it was broken, and when i asked them if they had used a supervised feed forward net or unsupervised autoencoders, the dude looked at me as if I was talking in Latin....so i didnt even lose to a team using deep learning , I lost to one pretending to use deep learning. 

I know i just sound like a salty loser but it's just incomprehensible to me. The judge was a representative of a startup that very proudly used ""Machine Learning to enhance their Cyber Security Solutions, to provide their users with the right security for todays multi cloud environment""....and they picked a solution with horrible recall, tested on an unreliable dataset, that could never be put into production over everything else ( there were two more teams thay used approaches similar to ours but with slightly different preprocessing and final accuracy metrics). But none of that mattered...they judged entirely based on two words. Deep. Learning.

He discusses the reality of ML deployments in four major parts of his work and how to cope with the boringness. Here is a quick summary and you can also check out the [original blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-is-boring-1d43473e353e) he wrote.

[**1. Designing**](https://crossminds.ai/video/5fb2e4a686dab96c840acd9e/?timecode=114.57635909155273)

\- Expected: Apply the latest & greatest algorithms on every project

\- Reality: Implement algorithms that will get the job done within the timeframe.

[**2. Coding**](https://crossminds.ai/video/5fb2e4a686dab96c840acd9e/?timecode=175.29553207390975)

\- Expected: Spend most time coding the ML component

\- Reality: Spend most time coding everything else (system, data pipeline, etc.)

[**3. Debugging**](https://crossminds.ai/video/5fb2e4a686dab96c840acd9e/?timecode=274.7941132145767)

\- Expected: Improve model performance (intellectually challenging & rewarding)

\- Reality: Fix traditional software issues to get a good enough result and move on

[**4. Firefighting**](https://crossminds.ai/video/5fb2e4a686dab96c840acd9e/?timecode=365.2176719809265)

\- Expected: not much

\- Reality: deal with unexpected internal/external problems all the time

[**Some coping mechanisms:**](https://crossminds.ai/video/5fb2e4a686dab96c840acd9e/?timecode=483.4506288521805)

Developing side projects, gamifying the debug process, talking to people in the industry, etc.

**Bottom line:**  You would need to accept that there are a lot more than just developing smart algorithms in a machine learning career. Try to cope with the frustration and boringness, and ""enjoy the small reward along the way and the final victory"".

myiw7e,[D] The Rants of an experienced engineer who glimpsed into AI Academia (Briefly),"# Background

I recently graduated with a master's degree and was fortunate/unfortunate to glimpse the whole ""Academic"" side of ML. I took a thesis track in my degree because as an immigrant it's harder to get into a good research lab without having authorship in a couple of good papers  (Or so I delude myself ). 

I worked as a Full-stack SWE for a startup for 4+ years before coming to the US for a master’s degree focused on ML and AI. I did everything in those years. From project management to building fully polished S/W products to DevOps to even dabbled in ML. I did my Batchelor’s degree from a university whose name is not even worth mentioning. The university for my master’s degree is in the top 20 in the AI space.  I didn't know much about ML and the curiosity drove me to university.  

Come to uni and I focused on learning ML and AI for one 1-1.5 years after which I found advisors for a thesis topic. This is when the fun starts. I had the most amazing advisors but the entire peer review system and the way we assess ML/Science is what ticked me off. This is where the rant begins. 

# Rant 1:Acadmia follows a Gated Institutional Narrative

Let's say you are a Ph.D. at the world's top AI institution working under the best prof. You have a way higher likelihood of you getting a good Postdoc at a huge research lab vs someone's from my poor country doing a Ph.D. with a not-so-well-known advisor having published not-so-well-known papers. I come from a developing nation and I see this many times here. In my country academics don't get funding as they do at colleges in the US. One of the reasons for this is that colleges don't have such huge endowments and many academics don't have wealthy research sponsors.  Brand names and prestige carry massive weight to help get funding in US academic circles. This prestige/money percolates down to the students and the researchers who work there. Students in top colleges get a huge advantage and the circles of top researchers keep being from the same sets of institutions. I have nothing against top researchers from top institutions but due to the nature of citations and the way the money flows based on them, a vicious cycle is created where the best institutions keep getting better and the rest don't get as much of a notice. 

# Rant 2: Peer Review without Code Review in ML/AI is shady 

I am a computer scientist and I was appalled when I heard that you don't need to do code reviews for research papers. As a computer scientist and someone who actually did shit tons of actual ML in the past year, I find it absolutely garbage that code reviews are not a part of this system. I am not saying every scientist who reads a paper should review code but at least one person should for any paper's code submission. At least in ML and AI space. This is basic. I don't get why people call themselves computer scientists if they don't want to read the fucking code. If you can't then make a grad student do it. But for the collective of science, we need this.  

***The core problem lies in the fact that peer review is free. :*** There should be better solutions for this. We ended up creating Git and that changed so many lives. Academic Research needs something similar.

# Rant 3: My Idea is Novel Until I see Someone Else's Paper

The volume of scientific research is growing exponentially. Information is being created faster than we can digest.  We can't expect people to know everything and the amount of overlap in the AI/ML fields requires way better search engines than Google Scholar. 

The side effect of large volumes of research is that every paper is doing something ""novel"" making it harder to filter what the fuck was novel. 

I have had so many experiences where I coded up something and came to realize that someone else has done something symbolically similar and my work just seems like a small variant of that. That's what fucks with my head. Is what I did in Novel? What the fuck is Novel? Is stitching up a transformer to any problem with fancy embeddings and tidying it up as a research paper Novel? Is just making a transformer bigger Novel?  Is some new RL algorithm tested with 5 seeds and some fancy fucking prior and some esoteric reasoning for its success Novel? Is using an over parameterized model to get 95% accuracy on 200 sample test set Novel? Is apply Self-supervised learning for some new dataset Novel? If I keep on listing questions on novelty, I can probably write a novel asking about what the fuck is ""Novel"". 

# Rant 4: Citation Based Optimization Promotes Self Growth Over Collective Growth

Whatever people may say about collaboration, Academia intrinsically doesn't promote the right incentive structures to harbor collaboration. Let me explain, When you write a paper, the position of your name matters. If you are just a Ph.D. student and a first author to a paper, it's great. If you are an nth author Not so great. Apparently, this is a very touchy thing for academics. And lots of egos can clash around numbering and ordering of names.  I distinctly remember once attending some seminar in a lab and approaching a few students on research project ideas. The first thing that came out of the PhD student's mouth was the position in authorship. As an engineer who worked with teams in the past, this was never something I had thought about. Especially because I worked in industry, where it's always the group over the person. Academia is the reverse. Academia applauds the celebration of the individual's achievements. 

All of this is understandable but it's something I don't like. This makes PhDs stick to their lane. The way citations/research-focus calibrate the ""hire-ability"" and ""completion of Ph.D. thesis"" metrics, people are incentivized to think about themselves instead of thinking about collaborations for making something better. 

# Conclusion

A Ph.D. in its most idealistic sense for me is the pursuit of hard ideas(I am poetic that way). In a situation like now when you have to publish or perish and words on paper get passed off as science without even seeing the code that runs it, I am extremely discouraged to go down that route.  All these rants are not to diss on scientists. I did them because ""we"" as a community need better ways to addressing some of these problems.


P.S.
Never expected so many people to express their opinions about this rant. 

U shouldn’t take this seriously. As many people have stated I am an outsider with tiny experience to give a full picture.

I realize that my post as coming out as something which tries to dichotomize academia and industry. I am not trying to do that. I wanted to highlight some problems I saw for which there is no one person to blame. These issues are in my opinion a byproduct of the economics which created this system.

1bvi4au,[D] LLMs are harming AI research,"This is a bold claim, but I feel like LLM hype dying down is long overdue. Not only there has been relatively little progress done to LLM performance and design improvements after GPT4: the primary way to make it better is still just to make it bigger and all alternative architectures to transformer proved to be subpar and inferior, they drive attention (and investment) away from other, potentially more impactful technologies. This is in combination with influx of people without any kind of knowledge of how even basic machine learning works, claiming to be ""AI Researcher"" because they used GPT for everyone to locally  host a model, trying to convince you that ""language models totally can reason. We just need another RAG solution!"" whose sole goal of being in this community is not to develop new tech but to use existing in their desperate attempts to throw together a profitable service. Even the papers themselves are beginning to be largely written by LLMs. I can't help but think that the entire field might plateau simply because the ever growing community is content with mediocre fixes that at best make the model score slightly better on that arbitrary ""score"" they made up, ignoring the glaring issues like hallucinations, context length, inability of basic logic and sheer price of running models this size.

oq33wd,[D] How is it that the YouTube recommendation system has gotten WORSE in recent years?,"Currently, the recommendation system seems so bad it's basically broken. I get videos recommended to me that I've just seen (probably because I've re-""watched"" music). I rarely get recommendations from interesting channels I enjoy, and there is almost no diversity in the sort of recommendations I get, despite my diverse interests. I've used the same google account for the past 6 years and I can say that recommendations used to be significantly better.

What do you guys think may be the reason it's so bad now?

Edit:

I will say my personal experience of youtube hasn't been about political echo-cambers but that's probably because I rarely watch political videos and when I do, it's usually a mix of right-wing and left-wing. But I have a feeling that if I did watch a lot of political videos, it would ultimately push me toward one side, which would be a bad experience for me because both sides can have idiotic ideas and low quality content.

Also anecdotally, I have spent LESS time on youtube than I did in the past. I no longer find interesting rabbit holes. ",805,232,logicallyzany,2021-07-23 14:06:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/oq33wd/d_how_is_it_that_the_youtube_recommendation/,0,MachineLearning
16x2o47,"[R] Meta, INRIA researchers discover that explicit registers eliminate ViT attention spikes","When visualizing the inner workings of vision transformers (ViTs), researchers noticed weird spikes of attention on random background patches. This didn't make sense since the models should focus on foreground objects.

By analyzing the output embeddings, they found a small number of tokens (2%) had super high vector norms, causing the spikes.

The high-norm ""outlier"" tokens occurred in redundant areas and held less local info but more global info about the image.

Their hypothesis is that ViTs learn to identify unimportant patches and recycle them as temporary storage instead of discarding. This enables efficient processing but causes issues.

Their fix is simple - just add dedicated ""register"" tokens that provide storage space, avoiding the recycling side effects.

Models trained with registers have:

* Smoother and more meaningful attention maps
* Small boosts in downstream performance
* Way better object discovery abilities

The registers give ViTs a place to do their temporary computations without messing stuff up. Just a tiny architecture tweak improves interpretability and performance. Sweet!

I think it's cool how they reverse-engineered this model artifact and fixed it with such a small change. More work like this will keep incrementally improving ViTs.

TLDR: Vision transformers recycle useless patches to store data, causing problems. Adding dedicated register tokens for storage fixes it nicely.

w4jg7q,[D] Hey Reddit! We're a bunch of research scientists and software engineers and we just open sourced a new state-of-the-art AI model that can translate between 200 different languages. We're excited to hear your thoughts so we're hosting an AMA on 07/21/2022 @ 9:00AM PT. Ask Us Anything!,"PROOF: [https://i.redd.it/2z42nlnbssc91.jpg](https://i.redd.it/2z42nlnbssc91.jpg)

We’re part of the team behind Meta AI’s latest AI breakthrough in machine translation with our No Language Left Behind (NLLB) project. It’s a translation system that can support over 200 languages, even if there isn't a lot of text available to learn from.   The reality is that a handful of languages dominate the web meaning only a fraction of the world can access content and contribute to the web in their own language. We want to change this by creating more inclusive machine translations systems – ones that unlock access to the web for the more than 4B people around the world that are currently excluded because they do not speak one of the few languages content is available in.   Here are a few things about NLLB we’re excited for:

* Latest breakthrough: we created a single model that translates over 200 different languages with state-of-the-art results.
* Billions of translations: We’re applying the techniques from the research advancements from NLLB to support more than 25 billion translations served every day on Facebook News Feed, Instagram, and our other platforms.
* Meta’s AI Research SuperCluster (RSC): This large-scale conditional language model is one of the first AI models trained on Meta’s AI Research SuperCluster (RSC) supercomputer.
* Open sourcing: By open sourcing our model and publishing a slew of research tools, we hope that AI researchers whose languages are not supported well or at all on commercial translations services could use our model to create support for that language. Furthermore, we’ve open sourced datasets, such as NLLB-Seed and FLORES-200 evaluation benchmark, which doubles the existing language coverage over our previous benchmark.
* Wikimedia Foundation collaboration: We collaborated with the Wikimedia Foundation to help improve translation systems on their Content Translations tool. Editors can now more efficiently translate and edit articles in 20  low-resource languages, including 10 that previously were not supported by any machine translation tools on the platform. 
* Books translation: we’re partnering with local publishers around the world to translate children’s stories.

My opinion is this company is anti-progressive for AI by locking things up which is contrary to their brand name. If they can’t even stay true to something easy like that, how should we expect them to stay true with AI safety which is much harder?

Q:For who?

A: For everyone.

Q:What is accomplished when people are killed?
A: Nothing.

Q:So rockets and electric cars are useless, but accomplishing nothing via murder is useful? Explain that one.

12zclus,"[D] Google researchers achieve performance breakthrough, rendering Stable Diffusion images in sub-12 seconds on a mobile phone. Generative AI models running on your mobile phone is nearing reality.","**What's important to know:**

&#x200B;

*  Stable Diffusion is an \\\~1-billion parameter model that is typically resource intensive. DALL-E sits at 3.5B parameters, so there are even heavier models out there.
*  Researchers at Google layered in a series of four GPU optimizations to enable Stable Diffusion 1.4 to run on a Samsung phone and generate images in under 12 seconds. RAM usage was also reduced heavily.
* **Their breakthrough isn't device-specific; rather it's a generalized approach that can add improvements to all latent diffusion models.** Overall image generation time decreased by 52% and 33% on a Samsung S23 Ultra and an iPhone 14 Pro, respectively.
*  Running generative AI locally on a phone, without a data connection or a cloud server, opens up a host of possibilities. This is just an example of how rapidly this space is moving as Stable Diffusion only just released last fall, and in its initial versions was slow to run on a hefty RTX 3080 desktop GPU.

&#x200B;

As small form-factor devices can run their own generative AI models, what does that mean for the future of computing? Some very exciting applications could be possible.

m73sy7,[P] My side project: Cloud GPUs for 1/3 the cost of AWS/GCP,"Some of you may have seen me comment around, now it’s time for an official post!

I’ve just finished building a little side project of mine - [https://gpu.land/](https://gpu.land/).

**What is it?** Cheap GPU instances in the cloud.

**Why is it awesome?**

* It’s dirt-cheap. You get a Tesla V100 for $0.99/hr, which is 1/3 the cost of AWS/GCP/Azure/\[insert big cloud name\].
* It’s dead simple. It takes 2mins from registration to a launched instance. Instances come pre-installed with everything you need for Deep Learning, including a 1-click Jupyter server.
* It sports a retro, MS-DOS-like look. Because why not:)

I’m a self-taught ML engineer. I built this because when I was starting my ML journey I was totally lost and frustrated by AWS. Hope this saves some of you some nerve cells (and some pennies)!

The most common question I get is - how is this so cheap? The answer is because AWS/GCP are charging you a huge markup and I’m not. In fact I’m charging just enough to break even, and built this project really to give back to community (and to learn some of the tech in the process).

m3boyo,[D] Why is tensorflow so hated on and pytorch is the cool kids framework?,"I have seen so many posts on social media about how great pytorch is and, in one latest tweet, 'boomers' use tensorflow ... It doesn't make sense to me and I see it as being incredibly powerful and widely used in research and industry. Should I be jumping ship? What is the actual difference and why is one favoured over the other? I have only used tensorflow and although I have been using it for a number of years now, still am learning. Should I be switching? Learning both? I'm not sure this post will answer my question but I would like to hear your honest opinion why you use one over the other or when you choose to use one instead of the other.

EDIT: thank you all for your responses. I honestly did not expect to get this much information and I will definitely be taking a harder look at Pytorch and maybe trying it in my next project. For those of you in industry, do you see tensorflow used more or Pytorch in a production type implementation? My work uses tensorflow and I have heard it is used more outside of academia - mixed maybe at this point?

EDIT2: I read through all the comments and here are my summaries and useful information to anyone new seeing this post or having the same question: 

TL;DR: People were so frustrated with TF 1.x that they switched to PT and never came back.

* Python is 30 years old FYI 
* Apparently JAX is actually where the cool kids are … this is feeling like highschool again, always the wrong crowd. 
* Could use pytorch to develop then convert with ONNX to tensorflow for deployment 
* When we say TF we should really say tf.keras. I would not wish TF 1.x on my worst enemy. 
* Can use PT in Colab. PT is also definitely popular on Kaggle
* There seems to be some indie kid rage where big brother google is not loved so TF is not loved. 
* TF 2.x with tf.keras and PT seem to now do similar things. However see below for some details. Neither seems perfect but I am now definitely looking at PT. Just looking at the installation and docs is a winner. As a still TF advocate (for the time being) I encourage you to check out TF 2.x - a lot of comments are related to TF 1.x Sessions etc.

Reasons for: 

* PT can feel laborious. With tf.keras it seems to be simpler and quicker, however also then lack of control. 
* Seems to still win the production argument 
* TF is now TF.Keras. Eager execution etc. has made it more align with PT 
* TF now has numpy implementation right in there. As well as gradient tape in for loop fashion making it actually really easy to manipulate tensors.
* PT requires a custom training loop from the get go. Maybe TF 2.x easier then for beginners now and can be faster to get a quick and dirty implementation / transfer learning. 
* PT requires to specify the hardware too (?) You need to tell it which gpu to use? This was not mentioned but that is one feeling I had. 
* Tf.keras maybe more involved in industry because of short implementation time 
* Monitoring systems? Not really mentioned but I don't know what is out there for PT. eg TF dashboard, projector
* PT needs precise handling of input output layer sizes. You have to know math.
* How is PT on edge devices - is there tfLite equivalent? PT Mobile it seems

Reason for Pytorch or against TF:

* Pythonic
* Actually opensource
* Steep learning curve for TF 1.x. Many people seem to have switched and never looked back on TF 2.x. Makes sense since everything is the same for PT since beginning
* Easier implementation (it just works is a common comment)
* Backward compatibility and framework changes in TF. RIP your 1.x code. Although I have heard there is a tool to auto convert to TF 2.x - never tried it though. I'm sure it fails unless your code is perfect. Pytorch is stable through and through.
* Installation. 3000 series GPUs. I already have experience with this. I hate having to install TF on any new system. Looks like PT is easier and more compatible.
* Academia is on PT kick. New students learning it as the first. Industry doesn't seem to care much as long as it works and any software devs can use it.
* TF has an issue of many features / frameworks trying to be forced together, creating incompatibility issues. Too many ways to do one thing, not all of which will actually do what you need down the road. 
* Easier documentation - potentially. 
* The separation between what is in tf and tf.keras
* Possible deprecation for Jax, although with all the hype I honestly see Jax maybe just becoming TF 3.x
* Debug your model by accessing intermediate representations (Is this what MLIR in TF is now?)
* Slow TF start-up
* PyTorch has added support for ROCm 4.0 which is still in beta. You can now use AMD GPUs! WOW - that would be great, although I like the nvidia monopoly for my stocks!
* Although tf.keras is now simple and quick, it may be oversimplified. PT seems to be a nice middle for any experimentation. 

Funny / excellent comments: 

* ""I'd rather be punched in the face than having to use TensorFlow ever again."" 
* "" PyTorch == old-style Lego kits where they gave pretty generic blocks that you could combine to create whatever you want. TensorFlow == new-style Lego kits with a bunch of custom curved smooth blocks, that you can combine to create the exact picture on the box; but is awkward to build anything else. 
* On the possibility of dropping TF for Jax. ""So true, Google loves killing things: hangouts, Google plus, my job application.."" 
* ""I've been using PyTorch a few months now and I've never felt better. I have more energy. My skin is clearer. My eye sight has improved. - Andrej Karpathy (2017)"" 
* ""I feel like there is 'I gave up on TF and never looked back feel here'""
* ""I hated the clusterfuck of intertwined APIs of TF2."" 
* ""…Pytorch had the advantage of being the second framework that could learn from the mistakes of Tensorflow - hence it's huge success."" 
* ""Keras is the gateway drug of DL!"" 
* ""like anything Google related they seemed to put a lot of effort into making the docs extremely unreadable and incomplete"" 
* ""more practical imo, pytorch is - the yoda bot"" 
* ""Pytorch easy, tensorflow hard, me lazy, me dumb. Me like pytorch.""",770,260,robintwhite,2021-03-12 06:26:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/m3boyo/d_why_is_tensorflow_so_hated_on_and_pytorch_is/,0,MachineLearning

beoxx8,[Discussion] When ML and Data Science are the death of a good company: A cautionary tale.,"TD;LR: At Company A, Team X does advanced analytics using on-prem ERP tools and older programming languages. Their tools work very well and are designed based on very deep business and domain expertise. Team Y is a new and ambitious Data Science team that thinks they can replace Team X's tools with a bunch of R scripts and a custom built ML platform. Their models are simplistic, but more ""fashionable"" compared to the econometric models used by Team X, and team Y benefits from the ML/DS moniker so leadership is allowing Team Y to start a large scale overhaul of the analytics platform in question. Team Y doesn't have the experience for such a larger scale transformation, and is refusing to collaborate with team X. This project is very likely going to fail, and cause serious harm to the company as a whole financially and from a people perspective. I argue that this is not just because of bad leadership, but also because of various trends and mindsets in the DS community at large. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update (Jump to below the line for the original story): 

Several people in the comments are pointing out that this just a management failure, not something due to ML/DS, and that you can replace DS with any buzz tech and the story will still be relevant. 

My response: 
Of course, any failure at an organization level is ultimately a management failure one way or the other. 
Moreover, it is also the case that ML/DS when done correctly, will always improve a company's bottom line. There is no scenario where the proper ML solution, delivered at a reasonable cost and in a timely fashion, will somehow hurt the company's bottom line.

My point is that in this case management is failing because of certain trends and practices that are specific to the ML/DS community, namely: 
* The idea that DS teams should operate independently of tech and business orgs -- too much autonomy for DS teams 
* The disregard for domain knowledge that seems prevalent nowadays  thanks to the ML hype, that DS can be generalists and someone with good enough ML chops can solve any business problem.  That wasn't the case when I first left academia for the industry in 2009  (back then nobody would even bother with a phone screen if you didn't have the right domain knowledge). 
* Over reliance on resources who check all the ML hype related boxes (knows Python, R, Tensorflow, Shiny, etc..., has the right Coursera certifications, has blogged on the topic, etc...), but are lacking in depth of  experience. DS interviews nowadays all seem to be: Can you tell me what a p-value is? What is elastic net regression? Show me how to fit a model in sklearn? How do you impute NAs in an R dataframe? Any smart person can look those up on Stackoverflow or Cross-Validated,.....Instead teams should be asking stuff like: why does portfolio optimization use QP not LP? How does a forecast influence a customer service level? When should a recommendation engine be content based and when should it use collaborative filtering? etc...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*(This is a true story, happening to the company I currently work for. Names, domains, algorithms, and roles have been shuffled around to protect my anonymity)* 

Company A has been around for several decades. It is not the biggest name in its domain, but it is a well respected one. Risk analysis and portfolio optimization have been a core of Company A's business since the 90s. They have a large team of 30 or so analysts who perform those tasks on a daily basis. These analysts use ERP solutions implemented for them by one the big ERP companies (SAP, Teradata, Oracle, JD Edwards,...) or one of the major tech consulting companies (Deloitte, Accenture, PWC, Capgemini, etc...) in collaboration with their own in house engineering team. The tools used are embarrassingly old school: Classic RDBMS running on on-prem servers or maybe even on mainframes, code written in COBOL, Fortran, weird proprietary stuff like ABAP or SPSS.....you get the picture. But the models and analytic functions were pretty sophisticated, and surprisingly cutting edge compared to the published academic literature. Most of all, they fit well with the company's enterprise ecosystem, and were honed based on years of deep domain knowledge. 

They have a tech team of several engineers (poached from the aforementioned software and consulting companies) and product managers (who came from the experienced pools of analysts and managers who use the software, or poached from business rivals) maintaining and running this software. Their technology might be old school, but collectively, they know the domain and the company's overall architecture very, very well. They've guided the company through several large scale upgrades and migrations and they have a track record of delivering on time, without too much overhead. The few times they've stumbled, they knew how to pick themselves up very quickly. In fact within their industry niche, they have a reputation for their expertise, and have very good relations with the various vendors they've had to deal with. They were the launching pad of several successful ERP consulting careers. 

Interestingly, despite dealing on a daily basis with statistical modeling and optimization algorithms, none of the analysts, engineers, or product managers involved describe themselves as data scientists or machine learning experts. It is mostly a cultural thing: Their expertise predates the Data Science/ML hype that started circa 2010, and they got most of their chops using proprietary enterprise tools instead of the open source tools popular nowadays. A few of them have formal statistical training, but most of them came from engineering or domain backgrounds and learned stats on the fly while doing their job. Call this team ""Team X"". 

Sometime around the mid 2010s, Company A started having some serious anxiety issues: Although still doing very well for a company its size, overall economic and demographic trends were shrinking its customer base, and a couple of so called disruptors came up with a new app and business model that started seriously eating into their revenue. A suitable reaction to appease shareholders and Wall Street was necessary. The company already had a decent website and a pretty snazzy app, what more could be done? Leadership decided that it was high time that AI and ML become a core part of the company's business. An ambitious Manager, with no science or engineering background, but who had very briefly toyed with a recommender system a couple of years back, was chosen to build a data science team, call it team ""Y"" (he had a bachelor's in history from the local state college and worked for several years in the company's marketing org). Team ""Y"" consists mostly of internal hires who decided they wanted to be data scientists and completed a Coursera certification or a Galvanize boot camp, before being brought on to the team, along with a few of fresh Ph.D or M.Sc holders who didn't like academia and wanted to try their hand at an industry role. All of them were very bright people, they could write great Medium blog posts and give inspiring TED talks, but collectively they had very little real world industry experience. 

As is the fashion nowadays, this group was made part of a data science org that reported directly to the CEO and Board, bypassing the CIO and any tech or business VPs, since Company A wanted to claim the monikers ""data driven"" and ""AI powered"" in their upcoming shareholder meetings. In 3 or 4 years of existence, team Y produced a few Python and R scripts. Their architectural experience  consisted almost entirely in connecting Flask to S3 buckets or Redshift tables, with a couple of the more resourceful ones learning how to plug their models into Tableau or how to spin up a Kuberneties pod.  But they needn't worry: The aforementioned manager, who was now a director (and was also doing an online Masters to make up for his qualifications gap and bolster his chances of becoming VP soon - at least he now understands what L1 regularization is), was a master at playing corporate politics and self-promotion. No matter how few actionable insights team Y produced or how little code they deployed to production, he always had their back and made sure they had ample funding. In fact he now had grandiose plans for setting up an all-purpose machine learning platform that can be used to solve all of the company's data problems. 

A couple of sharp minded members of team Y, upon googling their industry name along with the word ""data science"", realized that risk analysis was a prime candidate for being solved with Bayesian models, and there was already a nifty R package for doing just that, whose tutorial they went through on R-Bloggers.com. One of them had even submitted a Bayesian classifier Kernel for a competition on Kaggle (he was 203rd on the leaderboard), and was eager to put his new-found expertise to use on a real world problem. They pitched the idea to their director, who saw a perfect use case for his upcoming ML platform. They started work on it immediately, without bothering to check whether anybody at Company A was already doing risk analysis. Since their org was independent, they didn't really need to check with anybody else before they got funding for their initiative. Although it was basically a Naive Bayes classifier, the term ML was added to the project tile, to impress the board. 

As they progressed with their work however, tensions started to build. They had asked the data warehousing and CA analytics teams to build pipelines for them, and word eventually got out to team X about their project. Team X was initially thrilled: They offered to collaborate whole heartedly, and would have loved to add an ML based feather to their already impressive cap. The product owners and analysts were totally onboard as well: They saw a chance to get in on the whole Data Science hype that they kept hearing about. But through some weird mix of arrogance and insecurity, team Y refused to collaborate with them or share any of their long term goals with them, even as they went to other parts of the company giving brown bag presentations and tutorials on the new model they created. 

Team X got resentful: from what they saw of team Y's model, their approach was hopelessly naive and had little chances of scaling or being sustainable in production, and they knew exactly how to help with that. Deploying the model to production would have taken them a few days, given how comfortable they were with DevOps and continuous delivery (team Y had taken several months to figure out how to deploy a simple R script to production). And despite how old school their own tech was, team X were crafty enough to be able to plug it in to their existing architecture. Moreover, the output of the model was such that it didn't take into account how the business will consume it or how it was going to be fed to downstream systems, and the product owners could have gone a long way in making the model more amenable to adoption by the business stakeholders. But team Y wouldn't listen, and their leads brushed off any attempts at communication, let alone collaboration. The vibe that team Y was giving off was ""We are the cutting edge ML team, you guys are the legacy server grunts. We don't need your opinion."", and they seemed to have a complete disregard for domain knowledge, or worse, they thought that all that domain knowledge consisted of was being able to grasp the definitions of a few business metrics. 

Team X got frustrated and tried to express their concerns to leadership. But despite owning a vital link in Company A's business process, they were only \~50 people in a large 1000 strong technology and operations org, and they were several layers removed from the C-suite, so it was impossible for them to get their voices heard. 

Meanwhile, the unstoppable director was doing what he did best: Playing corporate politics. Despite how little his team had actually delivered, he had convinced the board that all analysis and optimization tasks should now be migrated to his yet to be delivered ML platform. Since most leaders now knew that there was overlap between team Y and team X's objectives, his pitch was no longer that team Y was going to create a new insight, but that they were going to replace (or modernize) the legacy statistics based on-prem tools with more accurate cloud based ML tools. Never mind that there was no support in the academic literature for the idea that Naive Bayes works better than the Econometric approaches used by team X, let alone the additional wacky idea that Bayesian Optimization would definitely outperform the QP solvers that were running in production. 

Unbeknownst to team X, the original Bayesian risk analysis project has now grown into a multimillion dollar major overhaul initiative, which included the eventual replacement of all of the tools and functions supported by team X along with the necessary migration to the cloud. The CIO and a couple of business VPs are on now board, and tech leadership is treating it as a done deal.

An outside vendor, a startup who nobody had heard of, was contracted to help build the platform, since team Y has no engineering skills. The choice was deliberate, as calling on any of the established consulting or software companies would have eventually led leadership to the conclusion that team X was better suited for a transformation on this scale than team Y. 

Team Y has no experience with any major ERP deployments, and no domain knowledge, yet they are being tasked with fundamentally changing the business process that is at the core of Company A's business. Their models actually perform worse than those deployed by team X, and their architecture is hopelessly simplistic, compared to what is necessary for running such a solution in production. 

Ironically, using Bayesian thinking and based on all the evidence, the likelihood that team Y succeeds is close to 0%. 

At best, the project is going to end up being a write off of 50 million dollars or more. Once the !@#$!@# hits the fan, a couple of executive heads are going to role, and dozens of people will get laid off.

At worst, given how vital risk analysis and portfolio optimization is to Company A's revenue stream, the failure will eventually sink the whole company. It probably won't go bankrupt, but it will lose a significant portion of its business and work force. Failed ERP implementations can and do sink large companies: Just see what happened to National Grid US, SuperValu or Target Canada. 

One might argue that this is more about corporate disfunction and bad leadership than about data science and AI. 

But I disagree. I think the core driver of this debacle is indeed the blind faith in Data Scientists, ML models and the promise of AI, and the overall culture of hype and self promotion that is very common among the ML crowd. 

We haven't seen the end of this story: I sincerely hope that this ends well for the sake of my colleagues and all involved. Company A is a good company, and both its customers and its employees deserver better. But the chances of that happening are negligible given all the information available, and this failure will hit my company hard. ",776,198,AlexSnakeKing,2019-04-18 18:25:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/beoxx8/discussion_when_ml_and_data_science_are_the_death/,0,MachineLearning

c4ylga,[D] Misuse of Deep Learning in Nature Journal’s Earthquake Aftershock Paper,"*Recently, I saw a [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/stand-up-for-best-practices-8a8433d3e0e8) by [Rajiv Shah](https://twitter.com/rajcs4), Chicago-based data-scientist, regarding an article published in Nature last year called [Deep learning of aftershock patterns following large earthquakes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0438-y), written by scientists at Harvard in collaboration with Google. Below is the article:*

**Stand Up for Best Practices:
Misuse of Deep Learning in Nature’s Earthquake Aftershock Paper**

**The Dangers of Machine Learning Hype**

Practitioners of AI, machine learning, predictive modeling, and data science have grown enormously over the last few years. What was once a niche field defined by its blend of knowledge is becoming a rapidly growing profession. As the excitement around AI continues to grow, the new wave of ML augmentation, automation, and GUI tools will lead to even more growth in the number of people trying to build predictive models.

But here’s the rub: While it becomes easier to use the tools of predictive modeling, predictive modeling knowledge is not yet a widespread commodity. Errors can be counterintuitive and subtle, and they can easily lead you to the wrong conclusions if you’re not careful.

I’m a data scientist who works with dozens of expert data science teams for a living. In my day job, I see these teams striving to build high-quality models. The best teams work together to review their models to detect problems. There are many hard-to-detect-ways that lead to problematic models (say, by allowing target leakage into their training data).

Identifying issues is not fun. This requires admitting that exciting results are “too good to be true” or that their methods were not the right approach. In other words, *it’s less about the sexy data science hype that gets headlines and more about a rigorous scientific discipline.*

**Bad Methods Create Bad Results**

Almost a year ago, I read an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0438-y) in Nature that claimed unprecedented accuracy in predicting earthquake aftershocks by using deep learning. Reading the article, my internal radar became deeply suspicious of their results. *Their methods simply didn’t carry many of the hallmarks of careful predicting modeling.*

I started to dig deeper. In the meantime, this article blew up and became [widely recognized](https://blog.google/technology/ai/forecasting-earthquake-aftershock-locations-ai-assisted-science/)! It was even included in the [release notes](https://medium.com/tensorflow/whats-coming-in-tensorflow-2-0-d3663832e9b8) for Tensorflow as an example of what deep learning could do. However, in my digging, I found major flaws in the paper. Namely, data leakage which leads to unrealistic accuracy scores and a lack of attention to model selection (you don’t build a 6 layer neural network when a simpler model provides the same level of accuracy).

To my earlier point: these are subtle, but *incredibly basic* predictive modeling errors that can invalidate the entire results of an experiment. Data scientists are trained to recognize and avoid these issues in their work. I assumed that this was simply overlooked by the author, so I contacted her and let her know so that she could improve her analysis. Although we had previously communicated, she did not respond to my email over concerns with the paper.

**Falling On Deaf Ears**

So, what was I to do? My coworkers told me to just [tweet](https://twitter.com/rajcs4/status/1143236424738775046) [it](https://twitter.com/DataScienceLA/status/1143245342785228800) and let it go, but I wanted to stand up for good modeling practices. I thought reason and best practices would prevail, so I started a 6-month process of writing up my results and shared them with Nature.
Upon sharing my results, I received a note from Nature in January 2019 that despite serious concerns about data leakage and model selection that invalidate their experiment, they saw no need to correct the errors, because “**Devries et al. are concerned primarily with using machine learning as [a] tool to extract insight into the natural world, and not with details of the algorithm design**.” The authors provided a much [harsher](https://github.com/rajshah4/aftershocks_issues/blob/master/correspondence/Authors_DeVries_Response.pdf) response.

You can read the entire exchange on my [github](https://github.com/rajshah4/aftershocks_issues).

It’s not enough to say that I was disappointed. This was a major paper (it’s **Nature**!) that bought into AI hype and published a paper despite it using flawed methods.

Then, just this week, I ran [across](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-20521-8_1) [articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01983) by Arnaud Mignan and Marco Broccardo on shortcomings that they found in the aftershocks article. Here are two more data scientists with expertise in earthquake analysis who also noticed flaws in the paper. I also have placed my analysis and reproducible code on [github](https://github.com/rajshah4/aftershocks_issues).

**Standing Up For Predictive Modeling Methods**

I want to make it clear: my goal is not to villainize the authors of the aftershocks paper. I don’t believe that they were malicious, and I think that they would argue their goal was to just show how machine learning could be applied to aftershocks. Devries is an accomplished earthquake scientist who wanted to use the latest methods for her field of study and found exciting results from it.

But here’s the problem: their insights and results were based on fundamentally flawed methods. It’s not enough to say, “This isn’t a machine learning paper, it’s an earthquake paper.” If you use predictive modeling, then the quality of your results are determined by the quality of your modeling. Your work becomes data science work, and you are on the hook for your scientific rigor.

There is a huge appetite for papers that use the latest technologies and approaches. It becomes very difficult to push back on these papers.

But if we allow papers or projects with fundamental issues to advance, it hurts all of us. It undermines the field of predictive modeling.

Please push back on bad data science. Report bad findings to papers. And if they don’t take action, go to twitter, post about it, share your results and make noise. This type of collective action worked to raise awareness of p-values and combat the epidemic of p-hacking. We need good machine learning practices if we want our field to continue to grow and maintain credibility.

donbz7,[D] I'm so sick of the hype,"Sorry if this is not a constructive post, its more of a rant really. I'm just so sick of the hype in this field, I want to feel like I'm doing engineering work/proper science but I'm constantly met with buzz words and ""business-y"" type language. I was browsing and I saw the announcement for the Tensorflow World conference happening now, and I went on the website and was again met with ""Be part of the ML revolution."" in big bold letters. Like okay, I understand that businesses need to get investors, but for the past 2 years of being in this field I'm really starting to feel like I'm in marketing and not engineering. I'm not saying the products don't deliver or that there's miss-advertising, but there's just too much involvement of ""business type"" folks more so in this field compared to any other field of engineering and science... and I really hate this. It makes me wonder why is this the case? How come there's no towardschemicalengineering.com type of website? Is it because its really easy for anyone to enter this field and gain a superficial understanding of things? 

The issue I have with this is that I feel a constant pressure to frame whatever I'm doing with marketing lingo otherwise you immediately lose people's interest if you don't play along with the hype. 

Anyhow /rant

Ultimately, research has just become chasing one deadline after another. Another thing that bugs me is that most of the research (including mine) is not very useful. Even if I get some citations, I feel that it is highly unlikely that the work I am doing will ever be used by the general public.

73n9pm,[D] Confession as an AI researcher; seeking advice,"I have a confession to make.

I was a CS major in college and took very few advanced math or stats courses. Besides basic calculus, linear algebra, and probability 101, I took only one machine learning class. It was about very specific SVMs/decision tree/probabilistic graphical models that I rarely encounter today.

I joined a machine learning lab in college and was mentored by a senior PhD. We actually had a couple of publications together, though they were nothing but minor architecture changes. Now that I’m in grad school doing AI research full-time, I thought I could continue to get away with zero math and clever lego building. Unfortunately, I fail to produce anything creative. What’s worse, I find it increasingly hard to read some of the latest papers, which probably don’t look complicated at all to math-minded students. The gap in my math/stats knowledge is taking a hefty toll on my career.

For example, I’ve never heard of the term “Lipschitz” or “Wasserstein distance” before, so I’m unable to digest the Wasserstein GAN paper, let alone invent something like that by myself. Same with f-GAN (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00709.pdf), and SeLU (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02515.pdf). I don’t have the slightest clue what the 100-page SeLU proof is doing. The “Normalizing Flow” (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05770.pdf) paper even involves physics (Langevin Flow, stochastic differential equation) … each term seems to require a semester-long course to master. I don’t even know where to start wrapping my head around. 

I’ve thought about potential solutions. The top-down approach is to google each unfamiliar jargon in the paper. That doesn’t work at all because the explanation of 1 unknown points to 3 more unknowns. It’s an exponential tree expansion. The alternative bottom-up approach is to read real analysis, functional analysis, probability theory textbooks. I prefer a systematic treatment, but … 

* reading takes a huge amount of time. I have the next conference deadline to meet, so I can’t just set aside two months without producing anything. My advisor wouldn’t be happy.
* but if I don’t read, my mindless lego building will not yield anything publishable for the next conference. What a chicken-and-egg vicious cycle. 
* the “utility density” of reading those 1000-page textbooks is very low. A lot of pages are not relevant, but I don’t have an efficient way to sift them out. I understand that some knowledge *might* be useful *some day*, but the reward is too sparse to justify my attention budget. The vicious cycle kicks in again. 
* in the ideal world, I can query an **oracle** with “Langevin flow”. The oracle would return a list of pointers, “given your current math capability, you should first read chapter 7 of Bishop’s PRML book, and then chapter 10 of information theory, and then chapter 12 of …”. Google is not such an oracle for my purpose. 

I’m willing to spend 1 - 2 hours a day to polish my math, but I need a more effective oracle. 
Is it just me, or does anyone else have the same frustration? 

EDIT: I'd appreciate it if someone could recommend *specific* books or MOOC series that focus more on **intuition and breadth**. Google lists tons of materials on real analysis, functional analysis, information theory, stochastic process, probability and measure theory, etc. Not all of them fit my use case, since I'm not seeking to redo a rigorous math major. Thanks in advance for any recommendation!

kvs1ex,[D] Here are 17 ways of making PyTorch training faster – what did I miss?,"[I've been collecting methods to accelerate training in PyTorch](https://efficientdl.com/faster-deep-learning-in-pytorch-a-guide/) – here's what I've found so far. What did I miss? What did I get wrong?

The methods – roughly sorted from largest to smallest expected speed-up – are:

1. Consider using a different learning rate schedule.
2. Use multiple workers and pinned memory in DataLoader.
3. Max out the batch size.
4. Use Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP).
5. Consider using a different optimizer.
6. Turn on cudNN benchmarking.
7. Beware of frequently transferring data between CPUs and GPUs.
8. Use gradient/activation checkpointing.
9. Use gradient accumulation.
10. Use DistributedDataParallel for multi-GPU training.
11. Set gradients to None rather than 0.
12. Use .as\_tensor rather than .tensor()
13. Turn off debugging APIs if not needed.
14. Use gradient clipping.
15. Turn off bias before BatchNorm.
16. Turn off gradient computation during validation.
17. Use input and batch normalization.

## 1. Consider using another learning rate schedule

The learning rate (schedule) you choose has a large impact on the speed of convergence as well as the generalization performance of your model.

Cyclical Learning Rates and the 1Cycle learning rate schedule are both methods introduced by Leslie N. Smith ([here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07120)), and then popularised by fast.ai's Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger ([here](https://www.fast.ai/2018/07/02/adam-weight-decay/) and [here](https://github.com/sgugger/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Cyclical%20LR%20and%20momentums.ipynb)). Essentially, the 1Cycle learning rate schedule looks something like this:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sc37u5knmxa61.png?width=476&format=png&auto=webp&s=09b309b4dbd67eedb4ab5f86e03e0e83d7b072d1

Sylvain writes:

>\[1cycle consists of\]  two steps of equal lengths, one going from a lower learning rate to a higher one than go back to the minimum. The maximum should be the value picked with the Learning Rate Finder, and the lower one can be ten times lower. Then, the length of this cycle should be slightly less than the total number of epochs, and, in the last part of training, we should allow the learning rate to decrease more than the minimum, by several orders of magnitude.

In the best case this schedule achieves a massive speed-up – what Smith calls *Superconvergence* – as compared to conventional learning rate schedules. Using the 1Cycle policy he needs \~10x fewer training iterations of a ResNet-56 on ImageNet to match the performance of the original paper, for instance). The schedule seems to perform robustly well across common architectures and optimizers.

PyTorch implements both of these methods `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CyclicLR` and `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.OneCycleLR,` see [the documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html).

One drawback of these schedulers is that they introduce a number of additional hyperparameters. [This post](https://towardsdatascience.com/hyper-parameter-tuning-techniques-in-deep-learning-4dad592c63c8) and [this repo](https://github.com/davidtvs/pytorch-lr-finder), offer a nice overview and implementation of how good hyper-parameters can be found including the Learning Rate Finder mentioned above.

Why does this work? It doesn't seem entirely clear but one[ possible explanation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf) might be that regularly increasing the learning rate helps to traverse [saddle points in the loss landscape ](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2015/file/430c3626b879b4005d41b8a46172e0c0-Paper.pdf)more quickly.

## 2. Use multiple workers and pinned memory in DataLoader

When using [torch.utils.data.DataLoader](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader), set `num_workers > 0`, rather than the default value of 0, and `pin_memory=True`, rather than the default value of False. Details of this are [explained here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html).

[Szymon Micacz](https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial/files/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf) achieves a 2x speed-up for a single training epoch by using four workers and pinned memory.

A rule of thumb that [people are using ](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/guidelines-for-assigning-num-workers-to-dataloader/813/5)to choose the number of workers is to set it to four times the number of available GPUs with both a larger and smaller number of workers leading to a slow down.

Note that increasing num\_workerswill increase your CPU memory consumption.

## 3. Max out the batch size

This is a somewhat contentious point. Generally, however, it seems like using the largest batch size your GPU memory permits will accelerate your training (see [NVIDIA's Szymon Migacz](https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial/files/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf), for instance). Note that you will also have to adjust other hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, if you modify the batch size. A rule of thumb here is to double the learning rate as you double the batch size.

[OpenAI has a nice empirical paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06162.pdf) on the number of convergence steps needed for different batch sizes. [Daniel Huynh](https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-a-batch-size-finder-in-fastai-how-to-get-a-4x-speedup-with-better-generalization-813d686f6bdf) runs some experiments with different batch sizes (also using the 1Cycle policy discussed above) where he achieves a 4x speed-up by going from batch size 64 to 512.

[One of the downsides](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04836.pdf) of using large batch sizes, however, is that they might lead to solutions that generalize worse than those trained with smaller batches.

## 4. Use Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)

The release of PyTorch 1.6 included a native implementation of Automatic Mixed Precision training to PyTorch. The main idea here is that certain operations can be run faster and without a loss of accuracy at semi-precision (FP16) rather than in the single-precision (FP32) used elsewhere. AMP, then, automatically decide which operation should be executed in which format. This allows both for faster training and a smaller memory footprint.

In the best case, the usage of AMP would look something like this:

    import torch
    # Creates once at the beginning of training
    scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()
    
    for data, label in data_iter:
       optimizer.zero_grad()
       # Casts operations to mixed precision
       with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
          loss = model(data)
    
       # Scales the loss, and calls backward()
       # to create scaled gradients
       scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    
       # Unscales gradients and calls
       # or skips optimizer.step()
       scaler.step(optimizer)
    
       # Updates the scale for next iteration
       scaler.update()

Benchmarking a number of common language and vision models on NVIDIA V100 GPUs, [Huang and colleagues find](https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-training-on-nvidia-gpus-with-pytorch-automatic-mixed-precision/) that using AMP over regular FP32 training yields roughly 2x – but upto 5.5x – training speed-ups.

Currently, only CUDA ops can be autocast in this way. See the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html#op-eligibility) here for more details on this and other limitations.

u/SVPERBlA points out that you can squeeze out some additional performance (\~ 20%) from AMP on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs if you convert your tensors to the [Channels Last memory format](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/memory_format_tutorial.html). Refer to [this section](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-convolutional/index.html#tensor-layout) in the NVIDIA docs for an explanation of the speedup and more about NCHW versus NHWC tensor formats.

## 5. Consider using another optimizer

AdamW is Adam with weight decay (rather than L2-regularization) which was popularized by fast.ai and is now available natively in PyTorch as `torch.optim.AdamW`. AdamW seems to consistently outperform Adam in terms of both the error achieved and the training time. See [this excellent blog](https://www.fast.ai/2018/07/02/adam-weight-decay/) post on why using weight decay instead of L2-regularization makes a difference for Adam.

Both Adam and AdamW work well with the 1Cycle policy described above.

There are also a few not-yet-native optimizers that have received a lot of attention recently, most notably LARS ([pip installable implementation](https://github.com/kakaobrain/torchlars)) and [LAMB](https://github.com/cybertronai/pytorch-lamb).

NVIDA's APEX implements fused versions of a number of common optimizers such as [Adam](https://nvidia.github.io/apex/optimizers.html). This implementation avoid a number of passes to and from GPU memory as compared to the PyTorch implementation of Adam, yielding speed-ups in the range of 5%.

## 6. Turn on cudNN benchmarking

If your model architecture remains fixed and your input size stays constant, setting `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True` might be beneficial ([docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/backends.html#torch-backends-cudnn)). This enables the cudNN autotuner which will benchmark a number of different ways of computing convolutions in cudNN and then use the fastest method from then on.

For a rough reference on the type of speed-up you can expect from this, [Szymon Migacz](https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial/files/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf) achieves a speed-up of 70% on a forward pass for a convolution and a 27% speed-up for a forward + backward pass of the same convolution.

One caveat here is that this autotuning might become very slow if you max out the batch size as mentioned above.

## 7. Beware of frequently transferring data between CPUs and GPUs

Beware of frequently transferring tensors from a GPU to a CPU using `tensor.cpu()` and vice versa using `tensor.cuda()` as these are relatively expensive. The same applies for `.item()` and `.numpy()` – use `.detach()` instead.

If you are creating a new tensor, you can also directly assign it to your GPU using the keyword argument `device=torch.device('cuda:0')`.

If you do need to transfer data, using `.to(non_blocking=True)`, might be useful [as long as you don't have any synchronization points](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/should-we-set-non-blocking-to-true/38234/4) after the transfer.

If you really have to, you might want to give Santosh Gupta's [SpeedTorch](https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/SpeedTorch) a try, although it doesn't seem entirely clear when this actually does/doesn't provide speed-ups.

## 8. Use gradient/activation checkpointing

Quoting directly from the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html):

>Checkpointing works by trading compute for memory. Rather than storing all intermediate activations of the entire computation graph for computing backward, the checkpointed part does **not** save intermediate activations, and instead recomputes them in backward pass. It can be applied on any part of a model.  
>  
>Specifically, in the forward pass, function will run in [torch.no\_grad()](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.no_grad.html#torch.no_grad) manner, i.e., not storing the intermediate activations. Instead, the forward pass saves the inputs tuple and the functionparameter. In the backwards pass, the saved inputs and function is retrieved, and the forward pass is computed on function again, now tracking the intermediate activations, and then the gradients are calculated using these activation values.

So while this will might slightly increase your run time for a given batch size, you'll significantly reduce your memory footprint. This in turn will allow you to further increase the batch size you're using allowing for better GPU utilization.

While checkpointing is implemented natively as `torch.utils.checkpoint`([docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html)), it does seem to take some thought and effort to implement properly. Priya Goyal [has a good tutorial ](https://github.com/prigoyal/pytorch_memonger/blob/master/tutorial/Checkpointing_for_PyTorch_models.ipynb)demonstrating some of the key aspects of checkpointing.

## 9. Use gradient accumulation

Another approach to increasing the batch size is to accumulate gradients across multiple `.backward()` passes before calling optimizer.step().

Following [a post](https://medium.com/huggingface/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255) by Hugging Face's Thomas Wolf, gradient accumulation can be implemented as follows:

    model.zero_grad()                                   # Reset gradients tensors
    for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(training_set):
        predictions = model(inputs)                     # Forward pass
        loss = loss_function(predictions, labels)       # Compute loss function
        loss = loss / accumulation_steps                # Normalize our loss (if averaged)
        loss.backward()                                 # Backward pass
        if (i+1) % accumulation_steps == 0:             # Wait for several backward steps
            optimizer.step()                            # Now we can do an optimizer step
            model.zero_grad()                           # Reset gradients tensors
            if (i+1) % evaluation_steps == 0:           # Evaluate the model when we...
                evaluate_model()                        # ...have no gradients accumulate

This method was developed mainly to circumvent GPU memory limitations and I'm not entirely clear on the trade-off between having additional `.backward()` loops. [This discussion](https://forums.fast.ai/t/accumulating-gradients/33219/28) on the fastai forum seems to suggest that it can in fact accelerate training, so it's probably worth a try.

## 10. Use Distributed Data Parallel for multi-GPU training

Methods to accelerate distributed training probably warrant their own post but one simple one is to use `torch.nn.DistributedDataParallel` rather than `torch.nn.DataParallel`. By doing so, each GPU will be driven by a dedicated CPU core avoiding the GIL issues of DataParallel.

In general, I can strongly recommend reading the [documentation on distributed training.](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dist_overview.html)

## 11. Set gradients to None rather than 0

Use `.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)` rather than `.zero_grad()`.

Doing so will let the memory allocator handle the gradients rather than actively setting them to 0. This will lead to yield a *modest* speed-up as they say in the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html), so don't expect any miracles.

Watch out, doing this is not side-effect free! Check the docs for the details on this.

## 12. Use .as_tensor() rather than .tensor()

`torch.tensor()` always copies data. If you have a numpy array that you want to convert, use `torch.as_tensor()` or `torch.from_numpy()` to avoid copying the data.

## 13. Turn on debugging tools only when actually needed

PyTorch offers a number of useful debugging tools like the [autograd.profiler](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#profiler), [autograd.grad\_check](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#numerical-gradient-checking), and [autograd.anomaly\_detection](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#anomaly-detection). Make sure to use them to better understand when needed but to also turn them off when you don't need them as they will slow down your training.

## 14. Use gradient clipping

Originally used to avoid exploding gradients in RNNs, there is both some [empirical evidence as well as some theoretical support](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJgnXpVYwS) that clipping gradients (roughly speaking: `gradient = min(gradient, threshold)`) accelerates convergence.

Hugging Face's [Transformer implementation](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/7729ef738161a0a182b172fcb7c351f6d2b9c50d/examples/run_squad.py#L156) is a really clean example of how to use gradient clipping as well as some of the other methods such as AMP mentioned in this post.

In PyTorch this can be done using `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_`([documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_.html#torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_)).

It's not entirely clear to me which models benefit how much from gradient clipping but it seems to be robustly useful for RNNs, Transformer-based and ResNets architectures and a range of different optimizers.

## 15. Turn off bias before BatchNorm

This is a very simple one: turn off the bias of layers before BatchNormalization layers. For a 2-D convolutional layer, this can be done by setting the bias keyword to False: `torch.nn.Conv2d(..., bias=False, ...)`.  (Here's a r[eminder why this makes sense](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46256747/can-not-use-both-bias-and-batch-normalization-in-convolution-layers).)

You will save some parameters, I would however expect the speed-up of this to be relatively small as compared to some of the other methods mentioned here.

## 16. Turn off gradient computation during validation

This one is straightforward: set `torch.no_grad()` during validation.

## 17. Use input and batch normalization

You're probably already doing this but you might want to double-check:

* Are you [normalizing](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html) your input?
* Are you using [batch-normalization](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BatchNorm2d.html)?

And [here's](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/437840/in-machine-learning-how-does-normalization-help-in-convergence-of-gradient-desc) a reminder of why you probably should.

### Bonus tip from the comments: Use JIT to fuse point-wise operations.

If you have adjacent point-wise operations you can use [PyTorch JIT](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html#creating-torchscript-code) to combine them into one FusionGroup which can then be launched on a single kernel rather than multiple kernels as would have been done per default. You'll also save some memory reads and writes.

[Szymon Migacz shows](https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial/files/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf) how you can use the `@torch.jit.script` decorator to fuse the operations in a GELU, for instance:

    @torch.jit.script
    def fused_gelu(x):
        return x * 0.5 * (1.0 + torch.erf(x / 1.41421))

In this case, fusing the operations leads to a 5x speed-up for the execution of `fused_gelu`  
as compared to the unfused version.

See also [this post](https://pytorch.org/blog/optimizing-cuda-rnn-with-torchscript/) for an example of how Torchscript can be used to accelerate an RNN.

y7708w,[D] How frustrating are the ML interviews these days!!! TOP 3% interview joke,"Hi all, Just want to share my recent experience with you.

I'm an ML engineer have 4 years of experience mostly with NLP. Recently I needed a remote job so I applied to company X which claims they hire the top 3% (No one knows how they got this number).

I applied two times, the first time passed the coding test and failed in the technical interview cause I wasn't able to solve 2 questions within 30min (solved the first one and the second almost got it before the time is up).

Second Trial: I acknowledged my weaknesses and grinded Leetcode for a while (since this is what only matters these days to get a job), and applied again, this time I moved to the Technical Interview phase directly, again chatted a bit (doesn't matter at all what you will say about our experience) and he gave me a dataset and asked to reach 96% accuracy within 30 min :D :D, I only allowed to navigate the docs but not StackOverflow or google search, I thought this should be about showing my abilities to understand the problem, the given data and process it as much as I can and get a good result fastly.

so I did that iteratively and reached 90% ACC, some extra features had Nans, couldn't remember how to do it with Numby without searching (cause I already stacked multiple features together in an array), and the time is up, I told him what I would have done If I had more time.

The next day he sent me a rejection email, after asking for an explanation he told me "" **Successful candidates can do more progress within the time given, as have experience with pandas as they know (or they can easily find out) the pandas functions that allow them to do things quickly (for example, encoding categorical values, can be done in one line, and handling missing values can also be done in one line** "" (I did it as a separate process cause I'm used to having a separate processing function while deploying).

Why the fuck my experience is measured by how quickly I can remember and use Pandas functions without searching them? I mainly did NLP work for 3 years, I only used Pandas and Jupyter as a way of analyzing the data and navigating it before doing the actual work, why do I need to remember that? so not being able to one-line code (which is shitty BTW if you actually building a project you would get rid of pandas as much as you can) doesn't mean I'm good enough to be top 3% :D.

I assume at this point top1% don't need to code right? they just mentally telepath with the tools and the job is done by itself.

If after all these years of working and building projects from scratch literally(doing all the SWE and ML jobs alone) doesn't matter cause I can't do one-line Jupyter pandas code, then I'm doomed.

and Why the fuk everything is about speed these days? Is it a problem with me and I'm really not good enough or what ??",741,164,Mogady,2022-10-18 13:24:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/y7708w/d_how_frustrating_are_the_ml_interviews_these/,0,MachineLearning

jtbr8c,[D] How do you find the motivation to keep doing ML?,"I currently work on ML research and am feeling completely demotivated. I want to hear how y'all manage to stay focused and productive. At a high level, here are the main reasons why I find it hard to justify working 8+ hours a day on ML:

1. **The world is burning** (Covid, climate change, social unrest), and I'm constantly wondering what the opportunity cost is for not doing something more immediately impactful and meaningful. I try to be more humble and accept that the world doesn't need me to ""save"" it. But it also feels wrong to just hunker down and tinker with hyperparameters all day.
2. In the deep learning era, the day-to-day ML work feels like **shooting in the dark**. Honestly every time I try to do something principled and grounded in theory, reality slaps me in the face. It just doesn't work. What does work is anticlimactic: training bigger & longer, or arbitrarily tweaking BERT for whatever niche.
3. **The field is so crowded**. The arxiv firehose is overwhelming and (forgive my cynicism) so full of noise. So much gets published everyday, yet so little. There's this crazy race to publish anything, regardless how meaningless that extra layer you added to BERT is. And while I really try to keep my integrity and not write a paper about how I swept the s\*\*\* out of those hyperparameters and increased the average GLUE score by a whooping 0.2, realistically I still need to keep up with this crazy pace if I don't want to get fired.

I feel trapped because I can't find pleasure neither in the process (which has become synonymous with throwing stuff at BERT and seeing what happens), nor the outcome (wasting huge amounts of compute power in a world that is burning, occasionally discovering mildly uninteresting things). At the end of the day, I'm depleted of energy and so can't rely on other areas of my life to fill in the void.

Enlighten me! What's your secret? How do you keep going?

k2pd9n,[D] Why you should get your PhD,"I have been hearing some negativity about PhDs recently, much of it justified I am sure. However, as someone who has largely enjoyed their PhD in reinforcement learning, I thought I might explain some of the great things that can come from a PhD and give my advice on things to consider. My advice is not scientific and I am sure many others have written better advice you should also read\*. 

That being said, here is a list of things which can make doing a PhD really satisfying:

1. A productive relationship with your advisor/supervisor. If you are lucky, you will find a supervisor who is a world expert and who responds promptly to your questions, takes interest in your ideas and suggests helpful improvements.
2. The opportunity to learn about interesting topics without expectation of concrete output.
3. Day to day work which matches the skill set you want to develop
4. The autonomy to build a project based on your own ideas
5. The expertise of the lab and your ability to collaborate, receive feedback and socialise with them
6. Getting a chance to intern with industry
7. Publishing your work at top tier conferences and journals

If you can get all of these things out of your PhD it can be a really fun and worthwhile experience and, with a bit of luck, will set you up for great career opportunities afterwards. However, working things out before starting can be hard. So lets say you've narrowed it down to a few advisors, how do you evaluate points 1-7? Here are some tips:

&#x200B;

1. Read carefully your potential advisor’s best publications and recent impactful work. Check if they have successfully supervised students in the past. Get in contact with current or past students to hear how they work with their supervisor currently. If you can, do a rotation project as part of a PhD program or Masters degree.
2. Find out if people in the lab have a lot of pressure to publish. If they do, it may make it difficult to learn about other areas. Is your lab/University a hub for creative ideas from a variety of perspectives with opportunities to attend interesting lectures and interact with talented people?
3. You will be an expert in the area(s) in which you do your PhD. Think about the skill set that would give you and your ability to sell that after the PhD. Equally, think about the process of acquiring those skills, and whether you would enjoy that process.
4. Does your advisor already have a narrow project laid out for you or is it a broader picture (I would recommend the latter, although it does come with more risk). Does your advisor publish across a narrow range of topics or does he or she publish work in multiple related areas? Is that work high quality or low quality?
5. Meet current lab members and try to get a sense of their interests, expertise and willingness to collaborate. If they have recent publications read them and ask them about it.
6. An internship during your PhD is great both for learning and building a career. Machine learning is unusual in its ability to provide these opportunities so take them if you can!
7. Do people in your lab regularly publish in top tier conferences and journals? Is their work widely cited, or more concretely, has it directly impacted research in the field?

Finally, bear in mind that in reality it is very unlikely you have an opportunity which satisfies all these criteria, so be reasonable in your expectations, balance them against non-PhD opportunities and having evaluated all the evidence carefully, follow your gut. Good luck!

Oh, and one more thing:

The sunk cost fallacy is real. When thinking about your existing projects and future projects, don’t be afraid to change tack if you worked hard on an idea and it just isn’t panning out. Similarly, don’t be afraid to change supervisor and or people you collaborate with if you honestly gave it your best shot and things are not working out. Be aware of when you are spinning your wheels and not making progress and do everything you can (within reason of course) to get out of it. If things get really bad, don’t be afraid to drop out. A PhD should be about excitement and opportunity and not fear of failure. Save that for the rest of your life!

rgykys,[D] I just found out that my 1 years' worth of research has already been published.,"I'm a PhD student in the middle of my studies. A year ago I had an idea  about designing a neural network for medical image segmentation using  shape priors. I have done a quick literature review at that time  (although I admit, it might not have been thorough enough) and I found  that no one really tried to use those shape priors before, especially  for the task that i wanted to use them on (these descriptors would fit  the specific task especially well). I worked hard on the implementation,  designing the network architecture, writing the article and  understanding all the necessary mathematical proofs/theorems related to  this task. I just submitted the article a few weeks ago (no word from it yet), and today, I  found an article on arxiv (no citations) that has been published this  spring and basically uses the same idea for the same task as I did. The  network architecture is different than mine and the performance  evaluation is different, but the main selling point of my article, the  usage of these shape priors has already been published. I am a bit  devastated at this point because this would have been my first 1st  author paper and I really put a lot of effort and thought into this,  only to discover that my idea has already been discovered before.  Obviously I need to do a much more thorough literature review next time  so that this doesn't happen again, but besides that, I don't know what  else I could do to mitigate the damage that has been done to my  motivation. I am even considering quitting PhD at this moment because I  feel like I wasted a lot of time because of my stupidity. Has anything  similar happened to you before? Do you have any advice? How could you  cope with similar issues in your career?",722,154,None,2021-12-15 13:00:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/rgykys/d_i_just_found_out_that_my_1_years_worth_of/,0,MachineLearning

f29l4v,[R] A popular self-driving car dataset is missing labels for hundreds of pedestrians,"**Blog Post:** [https://blog.roboflow.ai/self-driving-car-dataset-missing-pedestrians/](https://blog.roboflow.ai/self-driving-car-dataset-missing-pedestrians/)

**Summary:** The Udacity Self Driving Car dataset (5,100 stars and 1,800 forks) contains thousands of unlabeled vehicles, hundreds of unlabeled pedestrians, and dozens of unlabeled cyclists. Of the 15,000 images, I found (and corrected) issues with 4,986 (33%) of them.

**Commentary:**  
This is really scary. I discovered this because we're working on converting and re-hosting popular datasets in many popular formats for easy use across models... I first noticed that there were a bunch of completely unlabeled images.

Upon digging in, I was appalled to find that fully 1/3 of the images contained errors or omissions! Some are small (eg a part of a car on the edge of the frame or a ways in the distance not being labeled) but some are egregious (like the woman in the crosswalk with a baby stroller).

I think this really calls out the importance of rigorously inspecting any data you plan to use with your models. Garbage in, garbage out... and self-driving cars should be treated seriously.

I went ahead and corrected by hand the missing bounding boxes and fixed a bunch of other errors like phantom annotations and duplicated boxes. There are still quite a few duplicate boxes (especially around traffic lights) that would have been tedious to fix manually, but if there's enough demand I'll go back and clean those as well.

mbhewa,[D] Advanced Takeaways from fast.ai book,"I recently read the Fast AI deep learning [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50204643-deep-learning-for-coders-with-fastai-and-pytorch) and wanted to summarise some of the many advanced takeaways & tricks I got from it.  I’m going to leave out the basic things because there’s enough posts about them, i’m just focusing on what I found new or special in the book.

I’ve also put the insights into a [deck](https://saveall.ai/shared/deck/140&4&3K3uXPazkg4&reddit_posts) on save all to help you remember them over the long-term. I would **massively recommend using a spaced repetition app like anki or** [**save all**](https://saveall.ai/landing/reddit_posts) **for the things you learn** otherwise you’ll just forget so much of what is important. Here’s the takeaways:

# Neural Network Training Fundamentals

* Always **start** an ML project by **producing simple baselines**
   * If is binary classification then could even be as simple as predicting the most common class in the training dataset
   * Other baselines: linear regression, random forest, boosting etc…
* Then you can **use your baseline to clean your data** by looking at the datapoints it gets most incorrect and checking to see if they are actually classified correctly in the data
* In general you can also **leverage your baselines** to **help debug** your models
   * e.g. if you make your neural network 1 layer then it should be able to match the performance of a linear regression baseline, if it doesn’t then you have a bug!
   * e.g. if adding a feature improves the performance of linear regression then it should probably also improve the performance of your neural net unless you have a bug!
* Hyperparameter optimisation can help a bit (especially for the learning rate) but in general there are default hyperparameters that can do quite well and so **closely** **optimising the hyperparameters should be one of the last things you try** rather than the first
* **If you know something** about the problem then try to **inject it as an inductive bias into the training process**
   * e.g. if some of your features are related in a sequential way then incorporate them into training separately using an RNN
   * e.g. if you know the output should only be between -3 and 3 then use sigmoid to design the final layer so that it forces the output of the network to be in this range

# Transfer Learning

* Always use transfer learning if you can by finding a model pre-trained for a similar task and then fine-tune that model for your particular task
   * e.g. see [huggingface](http://huggingface.co/) for help with this in NLP
* **Gradual unfreezing** and **discriminative learning rates** work well when fine-tuning a transfer learned model
   * **Gradual unfreezing** = freeze earlier layers and **train the later layers only**, then **gradually unfreeze** the earlier layers one by one
   * **Discriminative learning rates** = having **different learning rates per layer of your network** (usually **earlier** **layers** have **smaller learning rates** than later layers)

# Tricks to Deal with Overfitting

* **Best way** to deal with **overfitting** is by getting **more data**. **Exhaust this first** before you start regularising with other methods
* **Data augmentation** is really powerful and now possible with text as well as images:
   * **Image** data augmentation -  crop, pad, squish and resize images
   * **Text** data augmentation - negate words, replace words with similes, perturb word embeddings (nice github [repo](https://github.com/QData/TextAttack) for this)
* **Mixup regularisation** = create new data by averaging together training datapoints
* **Backwards training (NLP only):** train an additional separate model that is **fed text backwards** and then **average the outputs** of your two models to get your final prediction

# Other Tricks to Improve Performance

* **Test time augmentation** = at test time, use the **average prediction** from many **augmented versions of the input** as your prediction rather than just the prediction from the true input
* **1 cycle training** = when you increase and reduce the learning rate throughout training in a circular fashion (usually makes a **huge difference)**
* **Learning rate finder algorithm** = algorithm that Fast AI provide to help you automatically discover roughly the best learning rate
* **Never use one-hot encodings,** use **embeddings** instead, even in **tabular data**!
* Using **AdamW** instead of **Adam** can help a little bit
* **Lower precision training** can help and on [pytorch lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) is just a simple flag you can set
* For **regression problems** if you know the **output should be within a range** then its good to use **sigmoid** to force the neural net output to be within this range
   * I.e. make the network output:  min\_value + sigmoid(output) \* (max\_value - min\_value)
* **Clustering** your features can help you **identify which ones are the most redundant** and then removing the can help performance
* **Label smoothing** = use 0.1 and 0.9 instead of 0 and 1 for label targets (can smoothen training)
* **Don’t dichotomise** your data, if your output is continuous then its better to train the network to predict continuous values rather than turning it into a classification problem
* **Progressive resizing** = train model on smaller resolution images first, then increase resolution gradually (can speed up training a lot)
* Strategically using **bottleneck layers** to force the network to form **more compact representations of the data** at different points can be helpful
* Try using **skip connections** as they can help smooth out the loss surface

j4jrln,[D] Possible malware found hidden inside images from the ImageNet dataset,"I think I've discovered malware hidden inside at least one image from the bat synset: http://imagenet.stanford.edu/api/text/imagenet.synset.geturls?wnid=n02139199

The following URLs show up in Microsoft's AV tools as containing malware:

> http://www. learnanimals . com/gray-bat/gray-bat.gif

> http://www. pixelbirds .co . uk/webnyct1.jpg

> http://www. pixelbirds .co . uk/webmarot2.jpg

But when I posted my find to this subreddit a few days ago, individuals had trouble reproducing my find. I assumed this meant it was a false positive, but decided to dig into why that might be. I sent Microsoft the files saying they were a false positive, and they responded saying that the files were indeed malicious. The IP addresses for the malicious files point to hosts that have been compromised numerous times in the past according to a quick search.

I believe there are two versions of gray-bat.gif, with one containing the malware and the other is completely clean. Somewhere along the line, a check is performed to determine what file to give the user requesting it and that's why some people end up with a file that doesn't contain malware. I don't know exactly what it checks for, but using wget seems to reliably get the malicious file.

When looking at this URL:

> http://www. learnanimals . com/gray-bat/gray-bat.gif

I find that it has a redirect to this page:

> http://www. learnanimals . com/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi 

This suspendedpage.cgi page has HTML code that contains a redirect to a URL that I suspect contains the malicious file:

https://pastebin.com/HXPxcgTV

It may be related to this: https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2015/02/deceiving-cpanel-account-suspended-page-serves-exploits/

The URL that's redirected to appears to be associated with malware distribution. VirusTotal & Hybrid-Analysis for the fwdssp domain:

https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/280363/0/html

I haven't been able to find out if/how the other two images work and I don't know what the malicious code is doing. I could be completely wrong about this, so keep that in mind. I also don't know if this possible malware is a threat to anyone downloading the ImageNet dataset or who the intended targets are. I also haven't checked every ImageNet image, as I've only been using a few synsets.

Edit:

Google Drive is now suddenly reporting the files as infected with a virus, but most AV tools are still not detecting anything.

**Abstract:**  We describe the new field of mathematical analysis of deep learning. This field emerged around a list of research questions that were not answered within the classical framework of learning theory. These questions concern: the outstanding generalization power of overparametrized neural networks, the role of depth in deep architectures, the apparent absence of the curse of dimensionality, the surprisingly successful optimization performance despite the non-convexity of the problem, understanding what features are learned, why deep architectures perform exceptionally well in physical problems, and which fine aspects of an architecture affect the behavior of a learning task in which way. We present an overview of modern approaches that yield partial answers to these questions. For selected approaches, we describe the main ideas in more detail.",690,142,julbern,2021-05-12 08:18:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/najnjg/r_the_modern_mathematics_of_deep_learning/,1,MachineLearning

kqazpd,[D] Why I'm Lukewarm on Graph Neural Networks,"**TL;DR:** GNNs can provide wins over simpler embedding methods, but we're at a point where other research directions matter more

I also posted it on my [blog here](https://www.singlelunch.com/2020/12/28/why-im-lukewarm-on-graph-neural-networks/), has footnotes, a nicer layout with inlined images, etc.

-----------

I'm only lukewarm on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). There, I said it.

It might sound crazy GNNs are one of the hottest fields in machine learning right now. [There][1] were at least [four][2] [review][3] [papers][4] just in the last few months. I think some progress can come of this research, but we're also focusing on some incorrect places.

But first, let's take a step back and go over the basics.

# Models are about compression

We say graphs are a ""non-euclidean"" data type, but that's not really true. A regular graph is just another way to think about a particular flavor of square matrix called the [adjacency matrix][5], like [this](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AdjacencyMatrices_1002.gif).

It's weird, we look at run-of-the-mill matrix full of real numbers and decide to call it ""non-euclidean"".

This is for practical reasons. Most graphs are fairly sparse, so the matrix is full of zeros. At this point, *where the non-zero numbers are* matters most, which makes the problem closer to (computationally hard) discrete math rather than (easy) continuous, gradient-friendly math.

**If you had the full matrix, life would be easy**

If we step out of the pesky realm of physics for a minute, and assume carrying the full adjacency matrix around isn't a problem, we solve a bunch of problems.

First, network node embeddings aren't a thing anymore. A node is a just row in the matrix, so it's already a vector of numbers.

Second, all network prediction problems are solved. A powerful enough and well-tuned model will simply extract all information between the network and whichever target variable we're attaching to nodes.

**NLP is also just fancy matrix compression**

Let's take a tangent away from graphs to NLP. Most NLP we do can be [thought of in terms of graphs][6] as we'll see, so it's not a big digression.

First, note that Ye Olde word embedding models like [Word2Vec][7] and [GloVe][8] are [just matrix factorization][9].

The GloVe algorithm works on a variation of the old [bag of words][10] matrix. It goes through the sentences and creates a (implicit) [co-occurence][11] graph where nodes are words and the edges are weighed by how often the words appear together in a sentence.

Glove then does matrix factorization on the matrix representation of that co-occurence graph, Word2Vec is mathematically equivalent.

You can read more on this in my [post on embeddings][12] and the one (with code) on [word embeddings][13].

**Even language models are also just matrix compression**

Language models are all the rage. They dominate most of the [state of the art][14] in NLP.

Let's take BERT as our main example. BERT predicts a word given the context of the [rest of the sentence](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png).

This grows the matrix we're factoring from flat co-occurences on pairs of words to co-occurences conditional on the sentence's context, like [this](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png)

We're growing the ""ideal matrix"" we're factoring combinatorially. As noted by [Hanh & Futrell][15]:

> [...] human language—and language modelling—has infinite statistical complexity but that it can be approximated well at lower levels. This observation has two implications: 1) We can obtain good results with comparatively small models; and 2) there is a lot of potential for scaling up our models. Language models tackle such a large problem space that they probably approximate a compression of the entire language in the [Kolmogorov Complexity][16] sense. It's also possible that huge language models just [memorize a lot of it][17] rather than compress the information, for what it's worth.

### Can we upsample any graph like language models do?

We're already doing it.

Let's call a **first-order** embedding of a graph a method that works by directly factoring the graph's adjacency matrix or [Laplacian matrix][18]. If you embed a graph using [Laplacian Eigenmaps][19] or by taking the [principal components][20] of the Laplacian, that's first order. Similarly, GloVe is a first-order method on the graph of word co-occurences. One of my favorites first order methods for graphs is [ProNE][21], which works as well as most methods while being two orders of magnitude faster.

A **higher-order** method embeds the original matrix plus connections of neighbours-of-neighbours (2nd degree) and deeper k-step connections. [GraRep][22], shows you can always generate higher-order representations from first order methods by augmenting the graph matrix.

Higher order method are the ""upsampling"" we do on graphs. GNNs that sample on large neighborhoods and random-walk based methods like node2vec are doing higher-order embeddings.

# Where are the performance gain?

Most GNN papers in the last 5 years present empirical numbers that are useless for practitioners to decide on what to use.

As noted in the [OpenGraphsBenchmark][4] (OGB) paper, GNN papers do their empirical section on a handful of tiny graphs (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) with 2000-20,000 nodes. These datasets can't seriously differentiate between methods.

Recent efforts are directly fixing this, but the reasons why researchers focused on tiny, useless datasets for so long are worth discussing.

**Performance matters by task**

One fact that surprises a lot of people is that even though language models have the best performance in a lot of NLP tasks, if all you're doing is cram sentence embeddings into a downstream model, there [isn't much gained][23] from language models embeddings over simple methods like summing the individual Word2Vec word embeddings (This makes sense, because the full context of the sentence is captured in the sentence co-occurence matrix that is generating the Word2Vec embeddings).

Similarly, [I find][24] that for many graphs **simple first-order methods perform just as well on graph clustering and node label prediction tasks than higher-order embedding methods**. In fact higher-order methods are massively computationally wasteful for these usecases.

Recommended first order embedding methods are ProNE and my [GGVec with order=1][25].

Higher order methods normally perform better on the link prediction tasks. I'm not the only one to find this. In the BioNEV paper, they find: ""A large GraRep order value for link prediction tasks (e.g. 3, 4);a small value for node classification tasks (e.g.1, 2)"" (p.9).

Interestingly, the gap in link prediction performance is inexistant for artificially created graphs. This suggests higher order methods do learn some of the structure intrinsic to [real world graphs][26].

For visualization, first order methods are better. Visualizations of higher order methods tend to have artifacts of their sampling. For instance, Node2Vec visualizations tend to have elongated/filament-like structures which come from the embeddings coming from long single strand random walks. See the following visualizations by [Owen Cornec][27] created by first embedding the graph to 32-300 dimensions using a node embedding algorithm, then mapping this to 2d or 3d with the excellent UMAP algorithm, like [this](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png)

Lastly, sometimes simple methods soundly beat higher order methods (there's an instance of it in the OGB paper).

The problem here is that **we don't know when any method is better than another** and **we definitely don't know the reason**.

There's definitely a reason different graph types respond better/worse to being represented by various methods. This is currently an open question.

A big part of why is that the research space is inundated under useless new algorithms because...

# Academic incentives work against progress

Here's the cynic's view of how machine learning papers are made:

1.  Take an existing algorithm
2.  Add some new layer/hyperparameter, make a cute mathematical story for why it matters
3.  Gridsearch your hyperparameters until you beat baselines from the original paper you aped
4.  Absolutely don't gridsearch stuff you're comparing against in your results section
5.  Make a cute ACRONYM for your new method, put impossible to use python 2 code on github (Or no code at all!) and bask in the citations

I'm [not][28] the [only one][29] with these views on the state reproducible research. At least it's gotten slightly better in the last 2 years.

### Sidebar: I hate Node2Vec

A side project of mine is a [node embedding library][25] and the most popular method in it is by far Node2Vec. Don't use Node2Vec.

[Node2Vec][30] with `p=1; q=1` is the [Deepwalk][31] algorithm. Deepwalk is an actual innovation.

The Node2Vec authors closely followed the steps 1-5 including bonus points on step 5 by getting word2vec name recognition.

This is not academic fraud -- the hyperparameters [do help a tiny bit][32] if you gridsearch really hard. But it's the presentable-to-your-parents sister of where you make the ML community worse off to progress your academic career. And certainly Node2Vec doesn't deserve 7500 citations.

# Progress is all about practical issues

We've known how to train neural networks for well over 40 years. Yet they only exploded in popularity with [AlexNet][33] in 2012. This is because implementations and hardware came to a point where deep learning was **practical**.

Similarly, we've known about factoring word co-occurence matrices into Word embeddings for at least 20 years.

But word embeddings only exploded in 2013 with Word2Vec. The breakthrough here was that the minibatch-based methods let you train a Wikipedia-scale embedding model on commodity hardware.

It's hard for methods in a field to make progress if training on a small amount of data takes days or weeks. You're disincentivized to explore new methods. If you want progress, your stuff has to run in reasonable time on commodity hardware. Even Google's original search algorithm [initially ran on commodity hardware][34].

**Efficiency is paramount to progress**

The reason deep learning research took off the way it did is because of improvements in [efficiency][35] as well as much better libraries and hardware support.

**Academic code is terrible**

Any amount of time you spend gridsearching Node2Vec on `p` and `q` is all put to better use gridsearching Deepwalk itself (on number of walks, length of walks, or word2vec hyperparameters). The problem is that people don't gridsearch over deepwalk because implementations are all terrible.

I wrote the [Nodevectors library][36] to have a fast deepwalk implementation because it took **32 hours** to embed a graph with a measly 150,000 nodes using the reference Node2Vec implementation (the same takes 3min with Nodevectors). It's no wonder people don't gridsearch on Deepwalk a gridsearch would take weeks with the terrible reference implementations.

To give an example, in the original paper of [GraphSAGE][37] they their algorithm to DeepWalk with walk lengths of 5, which is horrid if you've ever hyperparameter tuned a deepwalk algorithm. From their paper:

> We did observe DeepWalk’s performance could improve with further training, and in some cases it could become competitive with the unsupervised GraphSAGE approaches (but not the supervised approaches) if we let it run for >1000× longer than the other approaches (in terms of wall clock time for prediction on the test set) I don't even think the GraphSAGE authors had bad intent -- deepwalk implementations are simply so awful that they're turned away from using it properly. It's like trying to do deep learning with 2002 deep learning libraries and hardware.

# Your architectures don't really matter

One of the more important papers this year was [OpenAI's ""Scaling laws""][38] paper, where the raw number of parameters in your model is the most predictive feature of overall performance. This was noted even in the original BERT paper and drives 2020's increase in absolutely massive language models.

This is really just [Sutton' Bitter Lesson][39] in action:

> General methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin

Transformers might be [replacing convolution][40], too. As [Yannic Kilcher said][41], transformers are ruining everything. [They work on graphs][6], in fact it's one of the [recent approaches][42], and seems to be one of the more succesful [when benchmarked][1]

Researchers seem to be putting so much effort into architecture, but it doesn't matter much in the end because you can approximate anything by stacking more layers.

Efficiency wins are great -- but neural net architectures are just one way to achieve that, and by tremendously over-researching this area we're leaving a lot of huge gains elsewhere on the table.

# Current Graph Data Structure Implementations suck

NetworkX is a bad library. I mean, it's good if you're working on tiny graphs for babies, but for anything serious it chokes and forces you to rewrite everything in... what library, really?

At this point most people working on large graphs end up hand-rolling some data structure. This is tough because your computer's memory is a 1-dimensional array of 1's and 0's and a graph has no obvious 1-d mapping.

This is even harder when we take updating the graph (adding/removing some nodes/edges) into account. Here's a few options:

### Disconnected networks of pointers

NetworkX is the best example. Here, every node is an object with a list of pointers to other nodes (the node's edges).

This layout is like a linked list. Linked lists are the [root of all performance evil][43].

Linked lists go completely against how modern computers are designed. Fetching things from memory is slow, and operating on memory is fast (by two orders of magnitude). Whenever you do anything in this layout, you make a roundtrip to RAM. It's slow by design, you can write this in Ruby or C or assembly and it'll be slow regardless, because memory fetches are slow in hardware.

The main advantage of this layout is that adding a new node is O(1). So if you're maintaining a massive graph where adding and removing nodes happens as often as reading from the graph, it makes sense.

Another advantage of this layout is that it ""scales"". Because everything is decoupled from each other you can put this data structure on a cluster. However, you're really creating a complex solution for a problem you created for yourself.

### Sparse Adjacency Matrix

This layout great for read-only graphs. I use it as the backend in my [nodevectors][25] library, and many other library writers use the [Scipy CSR Matrix][44], you can see graph algorithms implemented on it [here][45].

The most popular layout for this use is the [CSR Format][46] where you have 3 arrays holding the graph. One for edge destinations, one for edge weights and an ""index pointer"" which says which edges come from which node.

Because the CSR layout is simply 3 arrays, it scales on a single computer: a CSR matrix can be laid out on a disk instead of in-memory. You simply [memory map][47] the 3 arrays and use them on-disk from there.

With modern NVMe drives random seeks aren't slow anymore, much faster than distributed network calls like you do when scaling the linked list-based graph. I haven't seen anyone actually implement this yet, but it's in the roadmap for my implementation at least.

The problem with this representation is that adding a node or edge means rebuilding the whole data structure.

### Edgelist representations

This representation is three arrays: one for the edge sources, one for the edge destinations, and one for edge weights. [DGL][48] uses this representation internally.

This is a simple and compact layout which can be good for analysis.

The problem compared to CSR Graphs is some seek operations are slower. Say you want all the edges for node #4243. You can't jump there without maintaining an index pointer array.

So either you maintain sorted order and binary search your way there (O(log2n)) or unsorted order and linear search (O(n)).

This data structure can also work on memory mapped disk array, and node append is fast on unsorted versions (it's slow in the sorted version).

# Global methods are a dead end

Methods that work on the **entire graph at once** can't leverage computation, because they run out of RAM at a certain scale.

So any method that want a chance of being the new standard need to be able to update piecemeal on parts of the graph.

**Sampling-based methods**

Sampling Efficiency will matter more in the future

*   **Edgewise local methods**. The only algorithms I know of that do this are GloVe and GGVec, which they pass through an edge list and update embedding weights on each step. 

The problem with this approach is that it's hard to use them for higher-order methods. The advantage is that they easily scale even on one computer. Also, incrementally adding a new node is as simple as taking the existing embeddings, adding a new one, and doing another epoch over the data

*   **Random Walk sampling**. This is used by deepwalk and its descendants, usually for node embeddings rather than GNN methods. This can be computationally expensive and make it hard to add new nodes.

But this does scale, for instance [Instagram][49] use it to feed their recommendation system models

*   **Neighbourhood sampling**. This is currently the most common one in GNNs, and can be low or higher order depending on the neighborhood size. It also scales well, though implementing efficiently can be challenging.

It's currently used by [Pinterest][50]'s recommendation algorithms.

# Conclusion

Here are a few interesting questions:

*   What is the relation between graph types and methods?
*   Consolidated benchmarking like OGB
*   We're throwing random models at random benchmarks without understanding why or when they do better
*   More fundamental research. Heree's one I'm curious about: can other representation types like [Poincarre Embeddings][51] effectively encode directed relationships?

On the other hand, we should **stop focusing on** adding spicy new layers to test on the same tiny datasets. No one cares.

lvwt3l,[D] Some interesting observations about machine learning publication practices from an outsider,"I come from a traditional engineering field, and here is my observation about ML publication practice lately:

I have noticed that there are groups of researchers working on the intersection of ""old"" fields such as optimization, control, signal processing and the like, who will all of a sudden publish a massive amount of paper that purports to solve a certain problem. The problem itself is usually recent and sometimes involves some deep neural network.

However, upon close examination, the only novelty is the problem (usually proposed by other unaffiliated groups) but not the method proposed by the researchers that purports to solve it.

I was puzzled by why a very large amount of seemingly weak papers, literally rehashing (occasionally, well-known) techniques from the 1980s or even 60s are getting accepted, and I noticed the following recipe:

1. **Only ML conferences.** These groups of researchers will only ever publish in machine learning conferences (and not to optimization and control conferences/journals, where the heart of their work might actually lie). For example, on a paper about adversarial machine learning, the entire paper was actually about solving an optimization problem, but the optimization routine is basically a slight variation of other well studied methods. ***Update***: I also noticed that if a paper does not go through NeurIPS or ICLR, they will be directly sent to AAAI and some other smaller name conferences, where they will be accepted. So nothing goes to waste in this field.
2. **Peers don't know what's going on.** Through openreview, I found that the reviewers (not just the researchers) are uninformed about their particular area, and only seem to comment on the correctness of the paper, but not the novelty. In fact, I doubt the reviewers themselves know about the novelty of the method. ***Update***: by novelty I meant how novel it is with respect to the state-of-the-art of a certain technique, especially when it intersects with operations research, optimization, control, signal processing. The state-of-the-art *could be* far ahead than what mainstream ML folks know about.
3. **Poor citation practices.** Usually the researchers will only cite themselves or other ""machine learning people"" (whatever this means) from the last couple of years. Occasionally, there will be 1 citation from hundreds of years ago attributed to Cauchy, Newton, Fourier, Cournot, Turing, Von Neumann and the like, and then a hundred year jump to 2018 or 2019. I see, ""This problem was studied by *some big name* in 1930 and *Random Guy XYZ* in 2018"" a lot.
4. **Wall of math.** Frequently, there will be a massive wall of math, proving some esoteric condition on the eigenvalue, gradient, Jacobian, and other curious things about their problem (under other esoteric assumptions). There will be several theorems, none of which are applicable because the moment they run their highly non-convex deep learning application, all conditions are violated. Hence the only thing obtained from these intricate theorems + math wall are some faint intuition (which are violated immediately). And then nothing is said. 

***Update***: If I could add one more, it would be that certain techniques, after being proposed, and after the authors claim that it beats a lot of benchmarks, will be seemingly be abandoned and never used again. ML researchers seem to like to jump around topics a lot, so that might be a factor. But usually in other fields, once a technique is proposed, it is refined by the same group of researchers over many years, sometimes over the course of a researcher's career.

In some ways, this makes certain area of ML sort of an echo chamber, where researchers are pushing through a large amount of known results rehashed and somewhat disguised by the novelty of their problem and these papers are all getting accepted because no one can detect the lack of novelty (or when they do detect, it is only 1 guy out of 3 reviewers). I just feel like ML conferences are sort of being treated as some sort of automatic paper acceptance cash cow.

Just my two cents coming from outside of ML. My observation does not apply to all fields of ML.",664,171,adforn,2021-03-02 07:51:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/lvwt3l/d_some_interesting_observations_about_machine/,0,MachineLearning
gonna8,[Discussion] Machine Learning is not just about Deep Learning,"I understand how mind blowing the potential of deep learning is, but the truth is, majority of companies in the world dont care about it, or do not need that level of machine learning expertise.

If we want to democratize machine learning we have to acknowledge the fact the most people Learning all the cool generative neural networks will not end up working for Google or Facebook.

What I see is that most youngsters join this bandwagon of machine learning with hopes of working on these mind-blowing ideas, but when they do get a job at a descent company with a good pay, but are asked to produce ""medicore"" models, they feel like losers.
I dont know when, but somewhere in this rush of deep learning, the spirit of it all got lost.

Since when did the people who use Gradient Boosting, Logistic regression, Random Forest became oldies and medicore.

The result is that, most of the guys we interwiew for a role know very little about basics and hardly anything about the underlying maths.
The just know how to use the packages on already prepared data.

Update : Thanks for all the comments, this discussion has really been enlightening for me and an amazing experience, given its my first post in reddit.
Thanks a lot for the Gold Award, it means a lot to me.

Just to respond to some of the popular questions and opinions in the comments.

1. Do we expect people to have to remember all the maths of the machine learning?

No ways, i dont remember 99% of what i studied in college. But thats not the point. When applying these algorithms, one must know the underlying principles of it, and not just which python library they need to import.

2. Do I mean people should not work on Deep Learning or not make a hype of it, as its not the best thing?

Not at all, Deep Learning is the frontier of Machine Learning and its the mind blowing potential of deep learning which brought most of us into the domain.
All i meant was, in this rush to apply deep learning to everything, we must not lose sight of simpler models, which most companies across the world still use and would continue to use due to there interpretability.

3. What do I mean by Democratization of ML.

ML is a revolutionary knowledge, we can all agree on that, and therefore it is essential that such knowledge be made available to all the people, so they can learn about its potential and benifit from the changes it brings to there lives, rather then being intimidated by it.

ecchg8,[News] Safe sexting app does not withstand AI,"A few weeks ago, the .comdom app was released by Telenet, a large Belgian telecom provider. The app aims to make sexting safer, by overlaying a private picture with a visible watermark that contains the receiver's name and phone number. As such, a receiver is discouraged to leak nude pictures.

[Example of watermarked image](https://preview.redd.it/q4fremfttd541.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31e8619cf977d0c595e5a5d43ff71f0eacaec634)

The .comdom app claims to provide a safer alternative than apps such as Snapchat and Confide, which have functions such as screenshot-proofing and self-destructing messages or images. These functions only provide the illusion of security. For example, it's simple to capture the screen of your smartphone using another camera, and thus cirumventing the screenshot-proofing and self-destruction of the private images. However, we found that the .comdom app only *increases* the illusion of security.

In a matter of days, we (IDLab-MEDIA from Ghent University) were able to automatically remove these visible watermarks from images. We watermarked thousands of random pictures in the same way that the .comdom app does, and provided those to a simple convolutional neural network with these images. As such, the AI algorithm learns to perform some form of image inpainting.

[Unwatermarked image, using our machine learning algorithm](https://preview.redd.it/ykkf8d5pyd541.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46158274a580dcb38861c5538b6b007fbd250595)

Thus, the developers of the .comdom have underestimated the power of modern AI technologies.

zfeh67,"[D] We're the Meta AI research team behind CICERO, the first AI agent to achieve human-level performance in the game Diplomacy. We’ll be answering your questions on December 8th starting at 10am PT. Ask us anything!","**EDIT 11:58am PT:** Thanks for all the great questions, we stayed an almost an hour longer than originally planned to try to get through as many as possible — but we’re signing off now! We had a great time and thanks for all thoughtful questions!

PROOF: [https://i.redd.it/8skvttie6j4a1.png](https://i.redd.it/8skvttie6j4a1.png)

We’re part of the research team behind CICERO, Meta AI’s latest research in cooperative AI. CICERO is the first AI agent to achieve human-level performance in the game Diplomacy. Diplomacy is a complex strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that emphasizes natural language negotiation between seven players.   Over the course of 40 two-hour games with 82 human players, CICERO achieved more than double the average score of other players, ranked in the top 10% of players who played more than one game, and placed 2nd out of 19 participants who played at least 5 games.   Here are some highlights from our recent announcement:

* **NLP x RL/Planning:** CICERO combines techniques in NLP and RL/planning, by coupling a controllable dialogue module with a strategic reasoning engine. 
* **Controlling dialogue via plans:** In addition to being grounded in the game state and dialogue history, CICERO’s dialogue model was trained to be controllable via a set of intents or plans in the game. This allows CICERO to use language intentionally and to move beyond imitation learning by conditioning on plans selected by the strategic reasoning engine.
* **Selecting plans:** CICERO uses a strategic reasoning module to make plans (and select intents) in the game. This module runs a planning algorithm which takes into account the game state, the dialogue, and the strength/likelihood of various actions. Plans are recomputed every time CICERO sends/receives a message.
* **Filtering messages:** We built an ensemble of classifiers to detect low quality messages, like messages contradicting the game state/dialogue history or messages which have low strategic value. We used this ensemble to aggressively filter CICERO’s messages. 
* **Human-like play:** Over the course of 72 hours of play – which involved sending 5,277 messages – CICERO was not detected as an AI agent.

gz3oc4,[P][N] Announcing Connected Papers - A visual tool for researchers to find and explore academic papers," Hi /r/MachineLearning, 

After a long beta, we are really excited to release [Connected Papers](http://connectedpapers.com/) to the public!

Connected papers is a unique, visual tool to help researchers and applied scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work.

[https://www.connectedpapers.com/](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)

I'm one of the creators, and in my work as a ML&CV engineer and team lead, almost every project involves a phase of literature review - trying to find the most similar work to the problem my team is trying to solve, or trying to track the relevant state of the art and apply it to our use case.

Connected Papers enables the researcher/engineer to explore paper-space in a much more efficient way. Given one paper that you think is relevant to your problem, it generates a visual graph of related papers in a way that makes it easy to see the most cited / recent / similar papers at a glance (Take a look at this [example graph](http://beta.connectedpapers.com:8050/main/9397e7acd062245d37350f5c05faf56e9cfae0d6/DeepFruits-A-Fruit-Detection-System-Using-Deep-Neural-Networks/graph) for a paper called ""DeepFruits: A Fruit Detection System Using Deep Neural Networks"").

mdldtt,[D] How Facebook got addicted to spreading misinformation,"Behind paywall:

With new machine-learning models coming online daily, the company created a new system to track their impact and maximize user engagement. The process is still the same today. Teams train up a new machine-learning model on FBLearner, whether to change the ranking order of posts or to better catch content that violates Facebook’s community standards (its rules on what is and isn’t allowed on the platform). Then they test the new model on a small subset of Facebook’s users to measure how it changes engagement metrics, such as the number of likes, comments, and shares, says Krishna Gade, who served as the engineering manager for news feed from 2016 to 2018.

If a model reduces engagement too much, it’s discarded. Otherwise, it’s deployed and continually monitored. On Twitter, Gade explained that his engineers would get notifications every few days when metrics such as likes or comments were down. Then they’d decipher what had caused the problem and whether any models needed retraining.

But this approach soon caused issues. The models that maximize engagement also favor controversy, misinformation, and extremism: put simply, people just like outrageous stuff. Sometimes this inflames existing political tensions. The most devastating example to date is the case of Myanmar, where viral fake news and hate speech about the Rohingya Muslim minority escalated the country’s religious conflict into a full-blown genocide. Facebook admitted in 2018, after years of downplaying its role, that it had not done enough “to help prevent our platform from being used to foment division and incite offline violence.”

While Facebook may have been oblivious to these consequences in the beginning, it was studying them by 2016. In an internal presentation from that year, reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, a company researcher, Monica Lee, found that Facebook was not only hosting a large number of extremist groups but also promoting them to its users: “64% of all extremist group joins are due to our recommendation tools,” the presentation said, predominantly thanks to the models behind the “Groups You Should Join” and “Discover” features.

cok47z,[N] AI pioneer Marvin Minsky accused of having sex with trafficking victim on Jeffrey Epstein’s island,"A victim of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein testified that she was forced to have sex with MIT professor Marvin Minsky, as revealed in a newly unsealed deposition. Epstein was registered as a sex offender in 2008 as part of a controversial plea deal. More recently, he was arrested on charges of sex trafficking amid a flood of new allegations.

Minsky, who died in 2016, was known as an associate of Epstein, but this is the first direct accusation implicating the AI pioneer in Epstein’s broader sex trafficking network. The deposition also names Prince Andrew of Britain and former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, among others.

The accusation against Minsky was made by Virginia Giuffre, who was deposed in May 2016 as part of a broader defamation suit between her and an Epstein associate named Ghislaine Maxwell. In the deposition, Giuffre says she was directed to have sex with Minsky when he visited Epstein’s compound in the US Virgin Islands.

As part of the defamation suit, Maxwell’s counsel denied the allegations, calling them “salacious and improper.” Representatives for Giuffre and Maxwell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A separate witness lent credence to Giuffre’s account, testifying that she and Minsky had taken a private plane from Teterboro to Santa Fe and Palm Beach in March 2001. Epstein, Maxwell, chef Adam Perry Lang, and shipping heir Henry Jarecki were also passengers on the flight, according to the deposition. At the time of the flight, Giuffre was 17; Minsky was 73.

A pivotal member of MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Lab, Marvin Minsky pioneered the first generation of self-training algorithms, establishing the concept of artificial neural networks in his 1969 book Perceptrons. He also developed the first head-mounted display, a precursor to modern VR and augmented reality systems.

Minsky was one of a number of prominent scientists with ties to Jeffrey Epstein, who often called himself a “science philanthropist” and donated to research projects and academic institutions. Many of those scientists were affiliated with Harvard, including physicist Lawrence Krauss, geneticist George Church, and cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker. Minsky’s affiliation with Epstein went particularly deep, including organizing a two-day symposium on artificial intelligence at Epstein’s private island in 2002, as reported by Slate. In 2012, the Jeffrey Epstein Foundation issued a press release touting another conference organized by Minsky on the island in December 2011.

That private island is alleged to have been the site of an immense sex trafficking ring. But Epstein associates have argued that those crimes were not apparent to Epstein’s social relations, despite the presence of young women at many of his gatherings.

“These people were seen not only by me,” Alan Dershowitz argued in a 2015 deposition. “They were seen by Larry Summers, they were seen by \[George\] Church, they were seen by Marvin Minsky, they were seen by some of the most eminent academics and scholars in the world.”

“There was no hint or suggestion of anything sexual or improper in the presence of these people,” Dershowitz continued.

11wxabh,[D] Is ML doomed to end up closed-source?,"So basically, OpenAI is keeping its models a secret, Hugging Face added a new gated feature, and LLaMA is using a non-commercial license. It looks like companies are all moving towards closed-source and monopolizing ML. 

I've always loved Hugging Face, but now they are doing the opposite of what they preach with this new gated feature thing, this is just not open-source and shouldn't be encouraged in the first place.

Open AI [clearly stated](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use#:~:text=use%20output%20from%20the%20Services%20to%20develop%20models%20that%20compete%20with%20OpenAI) that you can't ""use output from the Services to develop models that compete with OpenAI""

Google shared its paper Attention Is All You Need transparently which was a breakthrough in NLP and got utilized by OpenAI (with many other papers) to build GPT-4 which is adopted by Bing and now posing risk to Google's business. As a consequence, could companies start to avoid sharing research openly and rather monopolize their work for the sake of their own business safety?

Also, assuming we will witness more of these closed-source models. is it safe to just trust them without understanding what data they got exactly trained on? This doesn't seem to make sense, not sure how this would end up.",628,119,None,2023-03-20 21:52:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11wxabh/d_is_ml_doomed_to_end_up_closedsource/,0,MachineLearning

er3ng8,[D] How to save my father's voice?,"My father has contracted ALS, a disease where the motor neurons begin to degrade resulting in paralysis and death. There is no effective treatment and people typically live for 3-5 years after diagnosis,  however my father appears to be progressing more rapidly than is typical - going from being able to walk in October to needing a wheelchair now.

Today, to my horror, I've discovered that it's reached the stage where it is beginning to affect his voice. The next stage will be an inability to speak. I'm really scared about forgetting what he sounds like and my intention is to produce a large number of recordings of his voice.

I was wondering if anyone knew of anything out there that use machine learning to capture his voice and generate new recordings. It would be great if it was something I could use in a text-to-speech engine. Not only could I have something to remember him by and share with my future children, but he could potentially use in a speech synthesizer so he can still speak in his own voice.

I have come across one or two companies that claim to do it for the purpose of tweaking interviews, but on contacting them I haven't had much success.

Any help would be much appreciated. If this is the wrong place to post please let me know.",619,70,sverzijl,2020-01-19 22:40:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/er3ng8/d_how_to_save_my_fathers_voice/,0,MachineLearning

jm0lhu,"[D] Is there a ML community ""blind eye"" toward the negative impact of FAANG recommendation algorithms on global society?","If anyone has seen the social dilemma, you'll understand the impact FAANG recommender algorithms have on society. Not in a vague, roundabout way either. These algorithms are trained to maximize profit by influencing people's attention, information streams and priority queues. I think its truly a shame that working for Facebook, Google, YouTube, Twitter etc is seen as ""the holy grail"" as an ML engineer/ researcher.  The best paid (and therefore probably some of the most skilled) people in our field are working on thát. Not medicine, not science.. no, they work on recommender algorithms that act as catalysts for the worst in humanity, in turn for more ad revenue. A glaring (but fixed) example is a 13 year old girl watching diet videos will get anorexia videos recommended on YouTube, not because it's good for her, but because it maximizes the time she spends on YouTube to generate more ad revenue. And it works. Because it worked for thousands of other 13 year olds watching diet videos. 

 My apologies for a bit of a rant but I'm genuinely curious how other ML developers think about this. This is one of the biggest (or probably even THE biggest) impact that machine learning has on the world right now, yet I barely hear about it on this sub (I hope I'm wrong on this). 

Do you think people that developed these algorithms bear some responsibility? Do you think they knew the impact of their algorithms? And finally, maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like no one is discussing this here.

I am not the developer of The Big Sleep. [This](https://twitter.com/advadnoun/) is the developer's Twitter account; [this](https://www.reddit.com/user/advadnoun) is the developer's Reddit account.

**Steps to follow to generate the first image in a given Google Colab session**:

1. Optionally, if this is your first time using Google Colab, view this [Colab introduction](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) and/or this [Colab FAQ](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html).
2. Click [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NCceX2mbiKOSlAd_o7IU7nA9UskKN5WR?usp=sharing).
3. Sign into your Google account if you're not already signed in. Click the ""S"" button in the upper right to do this. Note: Being signed into a Google account has privacy ramifications, such as your Google search history being recorded in your Google account.
4. In the Table of Contents, click ""Parameters"".
5. Find the line that reads ""tx = clip.tokenize('''a cityscape in the style of Van Gogh''')"" and change the text inside of the single quote marks to your desired text; example: ""tx = clip.tokenize('''a photo of New York City''')"". The developer recommends that you keep the three single quote marks on both ends of your desired text so that mult-line text can be used  An alternative is to remove two of the single quotes on each end of your desired text; example: ""tx = clip.tokenize('a photo of New York City')"".
6. In the Table of Contents, click ""Restart the kernel..."".
7. Position the pointer over the first cell in the notebook, which starts with text ""import subprocess"". Click the play button (the triangle) to run the cell. Wait until the cell completes execution.
8. Click menu item ""Runtime->Restart and run all"".
9. In the Table of Contents, click ""Diagnostics"". The output appears near the end of the Train cell that immediately precedes the Diagnostics cell, so scroll up a bit. Every few minutes (or perhaps 10 minutes if Google assigned you relatively slow hardware for this session), a new image will appear in the Train cell that is a refinement of the previous image. This process can go on for as long as you want until Google ends your Google Colab session, which is a total of [up to 12 hours](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) for the free version of Google Colab.

**Steps to follow if you want to start a different run using the same Google Colab session:**

1. Click menu item ""Runtime->Interrupt execution"".
2. Save any images that you want to keep by right-clicking on them and using the appropriate context menu command.
3. Optionally, change the desired text. Different runs using the same desired text almost always results in different outputs.
4. Click menu item ""Runtime->Restart and run all"".

**Steps to follow when you're done with your Google Colab session**:

1. Click menu item ""Runtime->Manage sessions"". Click ""Terminate"" to end the session.
2. Optionally, log out of your Google account due to the privacy ramifications of being logged into a Google account.

The first output image in the Train cell (using the notebook's default of seeing every 100th image generated) usually is a very poor match to the desired text, but the second output image often is a decent match to the desired text. To change the default of seeing every 100th image generated, change the number 100 in line ""if itt % 100 == 0:"" in the Train cell to the desired number. **For free-tier Google Colab users, I recommend changing 100 to a small integer such as 5.**

Tips for the text descriptions that you supply:

1. In Section 3.1.4 of OpenAI's [CLIP paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/Learning_Transferable_Visual_Models_From_Natural_Language_Supervision.pdf) (pdf), the authors recommend using a text description of the form ""A photo of a {label}."" or ""A photo of a {label}, a type of {type}."" for images that are photographs.
2. A Reddit user gives [these tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/MediaSynthesis/comments/l2hmqn/this_aint_it_chief/gk8g8e9/).
3. The Big Sleep should generate [these 1,000 types of things](https://www.reddit.com/r/MediaSynthesis/comments/l7hbix/tip_for_users_of_the_big_sleep_it_should_on/) better on average than other types of things.

[Here](https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/big-sleep-ai-image-generator/) is an article containing a high-level description of how The Big Sleep works. The Big Sleep uses a modified version of [BigGAN](https://aiweirdness.com/post/182322518157/welcome-to-latent-space) as its image generator component. The Big Sleep uses the ViT-B/32 [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) model to rate how well a given image matches your desired text. The best CLIP model according to the CLIP paper authors is the (as of this writing) unreleased ViT-L/14-336px model; see Table 10 on page 40 of the [CLIP paper (pdf)](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/Learning_Transferable_Visual_Models_From_Natural_Language_Supervision.pdf) for a comparison.

There are [many other sites/programs/projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ldc6oc/p_list_of_sitesprogramsprojects_that_use_openais/) that use CLIP to steer image/video creation to match a text description.

Some relevant subreddits:

2. [r/deepdream](https://www.reddit.com/r/deepdream/) (subreddit for images/videos generated from machine learning algorithms).
3.

7htg5f,[D]Someone copied parts of my code and changed the license,"Hey there,

Let's get straight to the point : yesterday, NVIDIA released an open source[ pytorch implementation of flownet2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch), which released a CUDA version of the correlation layer introduced by the paper [FlowNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06852). It turns out out that this code is protected by NVIDIA copyright while it heavily reuse parts of a code I wrote myslef 6 months ago : [FlowNet Pytorch](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch)

My goal is not to rant or to fulfil my self esteem, but to figure what to do in the most pragmatic manner in order to take the best of both worlds and make the best implementation possible.

That's not the most important part, but as a proof, here are some comparisons you can make :

[mine](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch/blob/607f99f46be3eccbd9b07c73848a68bc12156392/multiscaleloss.py#L8) - [theirs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/losses.py#L46)

[mine](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch/blob/5381bd5c699b850785ab5dec6fda523b9126c912/models/FlowNetS.py#L32) - [theirs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/networks/FlowNetS.py#L11)

[mine](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch/blob/5381bd5c699b850785ab5dec6fda523b9126c912/models/FlowNetS.py#L9) - [theirs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/networks/submodules.py#L7)

Now as a disclaimer, I am very honoured they decided to use my code, and it is very obvious that my code is not rocket science and the main contribution of this project is not these little snippets but rather the custom layers and the pretrained weights for pytorch.

However, the fact that the README is not giving any credit for what I did feels a little uncool, especially with a [License file](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/LICENSE) saying that all copyright goes to NVIDIA.

My other concern is that the parts of the code that got copied were actually not very well written, and the implementation in my own repo is to my mind much better now (for example [`MulstiScaleLoss`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/losses.py#L46) module is a nightmare to read and to use while pytorch gives tools for making it [much more readable](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch/blob/master/multiscaleloss.py#L15)). I could make several Pull Requests but it's not garanteed to be merged rapidly and I'd prefer to contact the author first to get things straight and make them know that all I want is the best flownet2 implementation, and as this project is already gaining a lot of stars, it would be pointless to do my own fork ^with ^blackjack ^and ^hookers

My huge mistake was maybe to not have put a License in my code in the first place, but apparently, [a default one still holds](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/#choosing-the-right-license).

So what would be the best to do to get to work constructively with the project authors to improve their implementation and maybe also get a little credit for the code on which they built this project ? (also, is my claim reasonable ?)

Thanks in advance for your help !

EDIT thanks for your comments, I'll contact the main committor of the repo and hopefully everything will be alright! I am glad to see that it was indeed a reasonable claim

EDIT2 matter is solved for me, I got in touch with them quickly, thanks everyone for your help !",614,71,Ouitos,2017-12-05 22:37:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7htg5f/dsomeone_copied_parts_of_my_code_and_changed_the/,0,MachineLearning
oaambv,[N] GitHub and OpenAI release Copilot: an AI pair programmer,"Link to copilot: https://copilot.github.com/   

It is currently being made available as a VSCode extension. Relevant description from the website: 

> **What is GitHub Copilot?**
> GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less work. GitHub Copilot draws context from comments and code, and suggests individual lines and whole functions instantly. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a new AI system created by OpenAI. The GitHub Copilot technical preview is available as a Visual Studio Code extension.

> **How good is GitHub Copilot?**
> We recently benchmarked against a set of Python functions that have good test coverage in open source repos. We blanked out the function bodies and asked GitHub Copilot to fill them in. The model got this right 43% of the time on the first try, and 57% of the time when allowed 10 attempts. And it’s getting smarter all the time.

The service is based on OpenAI's Codex model, which has not been released yet but [Greg Brockman (OpenAI CTO) tweeted that it will be made available through their API later this summer](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1409890354132750336?s=20)",615,81,None,2021-06-29 15:30:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/oaambv/n_github_and_openai_release_copilot_an_ai_pair/,0,MachineLearning

cw39dx,[P] I applied Mark Zuckerberg's face to Facebook emojis,"Seeing the post on photorealistic emojis reminded me of a project I did last year: [Zuckerberg Emojis](https://rybakov.com/blog/zuckerberg_emojis/)

Why? Well, facebook forces us to use quite specific representation of emotions to react to things. In a way, these emojis become our facial expression. So it would only fair to apply the same expression to Zuckerberg's face.

I used CNNMRF, Deep Image Analogy and jcjohnsons neural style in sequence to apply the face and upscale it to a good resolution.

dn6xrr,[D] Google is applying BERT to Search,"Understanding searches better than ever before

If there’s one thing I’ve learned over the 15 years working on Google Search, it’s that people’s curiosity is endless. We see billions of searches every day, and 15 percent of those queries are ones we haven’t seen before--so we’ve built ways to return results for queries we can’t anticipate.

When people like you or I come to Search, we aren’t always quite sure about the best way to formulate a query. We might not know the right words to use, or how to spell something, because often times, we come to Search looking to learn--we don’t necessarily have the knowledge to begin with. 

At its core, Search is about understanding language. It’s our job to figure out what you’re searching for and surface helpful information from the web, no matter how you spell or combine the words in your query. While we’ve continued to improve our language understanding capabilities over the years, we sometimes still don’t quite get it right, particularly with complex or conversational queries. In fact, that’s one of the reasons why people often use “keyword-ese,” typing strings of words that they think we’ll understand, but aren’t actually how they’d naturally ask a question. 

With the latest advancements from our research team in the science of language understanding--made possible by machine learning--we’re making a significant improvement to how we understand queries, representing the biggest leap forward in the past five years, and one of the biggest leaps forward in the history of Search. 

**Applying BERT models to Search**  
Last year, we [introduced and open-sourced](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html) a neural network-based technique for natural language processing (NLP) pre-training called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or as we call it--[BERT](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html), for short. This technology enables anyone to train their own state-of-the-art question answering system. 

This breakthrough was the result of Google research on [transformers](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html): models that process words in relation to all the other words in a sentence, rather than one-by-one in order. BERT models can therefore consider the full context of a word by looking at the words that come before and after it—particularly useful for understanding the intent behind search queries.

But it’s not just advancements in software that can make this possible: we needed new hardware too. Some of the models we can build with BERT are so complex that they push the limits of what we can do using traditional hardware, so for the first time we’re using the latest [Cloud TPUs ](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/cloud-tpu-pods-break-ai-training-records)to serve search results and get you more relevant information quickly. 

**Cracking your queries**  
So that’s a lot of technical details, but what does it all mean for you? Well, by applying BERT models to both ranking and featured snippets in Search, we’re able to do a much better job  helping you find useful information. In fact, when it comes to ranking results, BERT will help Search better understand one in 10 searches in the U.S. in English, and we’ll bring this to more languages and locales over time.

Particularly for longer, more conversational queries, or searches where prepositions like “for” and “to” matter a lot to the meaning, Search will be able to understand the context of the words in your query. You can search in a way that feels natural for you.

To launch these improvements, we did a lot of [testing](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/mission/users/) to ensure that the changes actually are more helpful. Here are some of the examples that showed up our evaluation process that demonstrate BERT’s ability to understand the intent behind your search.  


Here’s a search for “2019 brazil traveler to usa need a visa.” The word “to” and its relationship to the other words in the query are particularly important to understanding the meaning. It’s about a Brazilian traveling to the U.S., and not the other way around. Previously, our algorithms wouldn't understand the importance of this connection, and we returned results about U.S. citizens traveling to Brazil. With BERT, Search is able to grasp this nuance and know that the very common word “to” actually matters a lot here, and we can provide a much more relevant result for this query.

Let’s look at another query: “do estheticians stand a lot at work.” Previously, our systems were taking an approach of matching keywords, matching the term “stand-alone” in the result with the word “stand” in the query. But that isn’t the right use of the word “stand” in context. Our BERT models, on the other hand, understand that “stand” is related to the concept of the physical demands of a job, and displays a more useful response.

Here are some other examples where BERT has helped us grasp the subtle nuances of language that computers don’t quite understand the way humans do.

**Improving Search in more languages**  
We’re also applying BERT to make Search better for people across the world. A powerful characteristic of these systems is that they can take learnings from one language and apply them to others. So we can take models that learn from improvements in English (a language where the vast majority of web content exists) and apply them to other languages. This helps us better return relevant results in the many languages that Search is offered in.

For featured snippets, we’re using a BERT model to improve featured snippets in the two dozen countries where this feature is available, and seeing significant improvements in languages like Korean, Hindi and Portuguese.

**Search is not a solved problem**  
No matter what you’re looking for, or what language you speak, we hope you’re able to let go of some of your keyword-ese and search in a way that feels natural for you. But you’ll still stump Google from time to time. Even with BERT, we don’t always get it right. If you search for “what state is south of Nebraska,” BERT’s best guess is a community called “South Nebraska.” (If you've got a feeling it's not in Kansas, you're right.)

Language understanding remains an ongoing challenge, and it keeps us motivated to continue to improve Search. We’re always getting better and working to find the meaning in-- and most helpful information for-- every query you send our way.

djju8a,[D] Jurgen Schmidhuber really had GANs in 1990,"he did not call it GAN, he called it curiosity, it's actually famous work, many citations in all the papers on intrinsic motivation and exploration, although I bet many GAN people don't know this yet

I learned about it through his [inaugural tweet](https://twitter.com/SchmidhuberAI) on their [miraculous year](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html). I knew LSTM, but I did not know that he and Sepp Hochreiter did all those other things 30 years ago. 

The blog sums it up in section 5 Artificial Curiosity Through Adversarial Generative Neural Networks (1990)

> The first NN is called the controller C. C (probabilistically) generates outputs that may influence an environment. The second NN is called the world model M. It predicts the environmental reactions to C's outputs. Using gradient descent, M minimises its error, thus becoming a better predictor. But in a zero sum game, C tries to find outputs that maximise the error of M. M's loss is the gain of C.  

> That is, C is motivated to invent novel outputs or experiments that yield data that M still finds surprising, until the data becomes familiar and eventually boring. Compare more recent summaries and extensions of this principle, e.g., [AC09]. 

> GANs are an application of Adversarial Curiosity [AC90] where the environment simply returns whether C's current output is in a given set [AC19].

So I read those referenced papers. [AC19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04493) is kinda modern guide to the old report [AC90](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/FKI-126-90ocr.pdf) where the adversarial part first appeared in section: Implementing Dynamic Curiosity and Boredom, and the generative part in section: Explicit Random Actions versus Imported Randomness, which is like GANs versus conditional GANs. [AC09](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/multipleways2009.pdf) is a survey from 2009 and sums it up: maximise reward for prediction error.

I know that Ian Goodfellow says he is the inventor of GANs, but he must have been a little boy when Jurgen did this in 1990. Also funny that Yann LeCun described GANs as ""the coolest idea in machine learning in the last twenty years"" although Jurgen had it thirty years ago  

No, it is NOT the same as predictability minimisation, that's yet another adversarial game he invented, in 1991, section 7 of his [explosive blog post which contains additional jaw-droppers](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html)",593,152,siddarth2947,2019-10-18 07:08:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/djju8a/d_jurgen_schmidhuber_really_had_gans_in_1990/,0,MachineLearning

lej57x,[D] Yet another rant on PhD Applications,"I guess this is kind of a rant about PhD admissions, specifically in ML and theoretical CS.

<rant>  


I recently applied to several top PhD programs, and so far I've been rejected from Berkeley, University of Washington, Columbia, Stanford, and MIT. I am expecting that I'll be rejected from the remaining programs soon. I didn't even get an interview chance, I was just rejected without speaking to anyone.

I'll start with my profile (which I am willing to verify on a zoom call if any mod requests it). I grew up in a poor city in a third world country, to a very poor family. I managed to work hard during high school, ranking 3rd in my country in national exams, and got accepted on a full ride scholarship to a Hong Kong university. I have a GPA of 3.9+. I have a first author NeurIPS paper that was completed without any faculty advisors (Me and another undergraduate wrote the paper independently and it got accepted). I also have a paper in an A\* information theory conference where we settled an open problem that has been open for 8 years. I have two submissions in TCS and IEEE Transactions on information theory (both A\* journals), and one has already received a minor revision (on its way to be accepted). During my undergrad, my mother got breast cancer, and I had to work two part time jobs just to help with paying for the medical bills, while keeping up with my studies and my research. I remember I slept an average of 5 hours per day in the months of treatment. I have seen two of my LORs, both professors mentioned that I am the best undergraduate who has worked with them in their lifetime as Professors.

I feel tired, mentally exhausted, and crushed. I've worked so hard over the last 8 years, just to have all my dreams destroyed. It doesn't help when everyone around me keeps saying I am ""a shoo-in for Stanford"". I just feel like I've been fighting an uphill fight all my life with no guidance, constantly having to work harder just to prove myself, and in the end, it still didn't work. I just don't understand what these top programs are looking for. I heard some programs like UWashington even interviewed the top 20% of applicants, which means I'm not even close.

134r0xf,[P] SoulsGym - Beating Dark Souls III Bosses with Deep Reinforcement Learning,"# The project

I've been working on a new gym environment for quite a while, and I think it's finally at a point where I can share it. SoulsGym is an OpenAI gym extension for Dark Souls III. It allows you to train reinforcement learning agents on the bosses in the game. The Souls games are widely known in the video game community for being notoriously hard.

.. Ah, and this is my first post on r/MachineLearning, so please be gentle ;)

# What is included?

**SoulsGym**

There are really two parts to this project. The first one is [SoulsGym](https://github.com/amacati/SoulsGym), an OpenAI gym extension. It is compatible with the newest API changes after gym has transitioned to the Farama foundation. SoulsGym is essentially a game hacking layer that turns Dark Souls III into a gym environment that can be controlled with Python. However, you still need to own the game on Steam and run it before starting the gym. A detailed description on how to set everything up can be found in the package [documentation](https://soulsgym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).

**Warning: If you want to try this gym, be sure that you have read the documentation and understood everything. If not handled properly, you can get banned from multiplayer.**

Below, you can find a video of an agent training in the game. The game runs on 3x speed to accelerate training. You can also watch the video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R5Ef69sFPE).

&#x200B;

[RL agent learning to defeat the first boss in Dark Souls III.](https://reddit.com/link/134r0xf/video/o6ctdppeo8xa1/player)

At this point, only the first boss in Dark Souls III is implemented as an environment. Nevertheless, SoulsGym can easily be extended to include other bosses in the game. Due to their similarity, it shouldn't be too hard to even extend the package to Elden Ring as well. If there is any interest in this in the ML/DS community, I'd be happy to give the other ones a shot ;)

**SoulsAI**

The second part is [SoulsAI](https://github.com/amacati/SoulsAI), a distributed deep reinforcement learning framework that I wrote to train on multiple clients simultaneously. You should be able to use it for other gym environments as well, but it was primarily designed for my rather special use case. SoulsAI enables live-monitoring of the current training setup via a webserver, is resilient to client disconnects and crashes, and contains all my training scripts. While this sounds a bit hacky, it's actually quite readable. You can find a complete documentation that goes into how everything works [here](https://soulsai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Being fault tolerant is necessary since the simulator at the heart of SoulsGym is a game that does not expose any APIs and has to be hacked instead. Crashes and other instabilities are rare, but can happen when training over several days. At this moment, SoulsAI implements ApeX style DQN and PPO, but since PPO is synchronous, it is less robust to client crashes etc. Both implementations use Redis as communication backend to send training samples from worker clients to a centralized training server, and to broadcast model updates from the server to all clients. For DQN, SoulsAI is completely asynchronous, so that clients never have to stop playing in order to perform updates or send samples.

&#x200B;

Note: I have not implemented more advanced training algorithms such as Rainbow etc., so it's very likely that one can achieve faster convergence with better performance. Furthermore, hyperparameter tuning is extremely challenging since training runs can easily take days across multiple machines.

# Does this actually work?

Yes, it does! It took me some time, but I was able to train an agent with Duelling Double Deep Q-Learning that has a win rate of about 45% within a few days of training. In this video you can see the trained agent playing against Iudex Gundry. You can also watch the video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86NivRglr3Y).

&#x200B;

I'm also working on a visualisation that shows the agent's policy networks reacting to the current game input. You can see a preview without the game simultaneously running here. Credit for the idea of visualisation goes to [Marijn van Vliet](https://github.com/wmvanvliet/scns).

&#x200B;

[Duelling Double Q-Learning networks reacting to changes in the game observations.](https://reddit.com/link/134r0xf/video/b0a4jzczv8xa1/player)

If you really want to dive deep into the hyperparameters that I used or load the trained policies on your machine, you can find the final checkpoints [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cAK1TbY4e4HE4cxyAFEHRpj6MOgp5Zxe?usp=sharing). The hyperparameters are contained in the *config.json* file.

# ... But why?

Because it is a ton of fun! Training to defeat a boss in a computer game does not advance the state of the art in RL, sure. So why do it? Well, because we can! And because maybe it excites others about ML/RL/DL.

**Disclaimer: Online multiplayer**

This project is in no way oriented towards creating multiplayer bots. It would take you ages of development and training time to learn a multiplayer AI starting from my package, so just don't even try. I also do not take any precautions against cheat detections, so if you use this package while being online, you'd probably be banned within a few hours.

# Final comments

As you might guess, this project went through many iterations and it took a lot of effort to get it ""right"". I'm kind of proud to have achieved it in the end, and am happy to explain more about how things work if anyone is interested. There is a lot that I haven't covered in this post (it's really just the surface), but you can find more in the docs I linked or by writing me a pm. Also, I really have no idea how many people in ML are also active in the gaming community, but if you are a Souls fan and you want to contribute by adding other Souls games or bosses, feel free to reach out to me.

hrawam,"[D] There's a flaw/bug in Tensorflow that's preventing gradient updates to weights in custom layers of models created using the Keras functional API, leaving those weights basically frozen. Might be worth checking `model.trainable_variables`.","EDIT:

Someone replied to the issue, this is what was said:

>It looks like what's going on is:
The layers currently enter a 'functional api construction' mode only if all of the inputs in the first argument come from other Keras layers. However, you have None included in the inputs in the first positional arg, so it's not triggering functional api construction.

>That causes the layer to get 'inlined' in the outer functional model rather than correctly included. You should be able to work around this by changing the layer api so Nones should not get passed in.

>We have a major cleanup/refactoring of the Functional API mostly done that make the functional api triggering much clearer (if any symbolic values appear in the inputs) & sort out a number of other issues w/ it. But, that will only land in 2.4. It's not immediately obvious if we can squeeze a fix into tf 2.3 as the RC is already out.

If you look at the notebooks, the inputs to some of the lines look like this:

`    P_outputs = P_trans11((inputHiddenVals, None, None, None))[0]`

It looks like the issue is that the  are extra `None`s are causing disappearing variables issue, and a workaround could be just to have 

`    P_outputs = P_trans11(inputHiddenVals)[0]`




----

tl'dr: For anyone who has used the functional api with custom layers, it might be worth running


    for i, var in enumerate(model.trainable_variables):
        print(model.trainable_variables[i].name)
    

so see if all your weights are there. 

----

Using custom layers with the functional API results in missing weights in the `trainable_variables`. Those weights are not in the `non_trainable_variables` either. 

But if those weights aren't in `trainable_variables`they are essential frozen, since it is only those weights that receive gradient updates, as seen in the Keras model training code below:

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1fb8f4988d69237879aac4d9e3f268f837dc0221/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L2729

        # We aggregate gradients before unscaling them, in case a subclass of
        # LossScaleOptimizer all-reduces in fp16. All-reducing in fp16 can only be
        # done on scaled gradients, not unscaled gradients, for numeric stability.
        gradients = optimizer._aggregate_gradients(zip(gradients,  # pylint: disable=protected-access
                                                       trainable_variables))

        if aggregate_grads_outside_optimizer:
          optimizer.apply_gradients(
              zip(gradients, trainable_variables),
              experimental_aggregate_gradients=False)
        else:
          optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, trainable_variables))



The bug can be seen in this Colab gist 

https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Santosh-Gupta/40c54e5b76e3f522fa78da6a248b6826/missingtrainablevarsinference_var.ipynb

This gist uses the transformers library to create the models so its easy to see the bug. For an in-depth look, the colab gist below creates all the custom layers from scratch

https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Santosh-Gupta/aa34086a72956600910976e4f7ebe323/model_weight_debug_scratch_public_inference_var.ipynb


As you can see in the notebooks, a workaround is to create models using keras subclassing instead; model subclassing results in all the weights appearing in `trainable_variables`. To be absolutely sure that the functional API and subclasses models are exactly the same, I ran inference on them using the same input at the bottom of each notebook; the outputs for the models were exactly the same. But training using the functional API model would treat many of the weights as frozen (and there's no way to make them unfrozen since those weights aren't registered in the `non_trainable_variables` either). 

I've been looking at this for about a month, as far as I can tell, I don't think there was anything unique about the transformer layer I created; it may be the case that Any Keras model using custom sublayers and the functional API is prone to this. 

I put up a Github issue 24 days ago, but I can't tell if this is something being worked on.

1680vy3,[D] 10 hard-earned lessons from shipping generative AI products over the past 18 months,"Hey all,

I'm the founder of a generative AI consultancy and we build gen AI powered products for other companies. We've been doing this for 18 months now and I thought I share our learnings - it might help others.

&#x200B;

1. It's a never ending battle to keep up with the latest tools and developments.  


2. By the time you ship your product it's already using an outdated tech-stack.  


3. There are no best-practices yet. You need to make a bet on tools/processes and hope that things won't change much by the time you ship (they will, see point 2).  


4. If your generative AI product doesn't have a VC-backed competitor, there will be one soon.  


5. In order to win you need one of the two things: either (1) the best distribution or (2) the generative AI component is hidden in your product so others don't/can't copy you.  


6. AI researchers / data scientists are suboptimal choice for AI engineering. They're expensive, won't be able to solve most of your problems and likely want to focus on more fundamental problems rather than building products.  


7. Software engineers make the best AI engineers. They are able to solve 80% of your problems right away and they are motivated because they can ""work in AI"".  


8. Product designers need to get more technical, AI engineers need to get more product-oriented. The gap currently is too big and this leads to all sorts of problems during product development.  


9. Demo bias is real and it makes it 10x harder to deliver something that's in alignment with your client's expectation. Communicating this effectively is a real and underrated skill.  


10. There's no such thing as off-the-shelf AI generated content yet. Current tools are not reliable enough, they hallucinate, make up stuff and produce inconsistent results (applies to text, voice, image and video).",586,166,BootstrapGuy,2023-09-02 12:10:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1680vy3/d_10_hardearned_lessons_from_shipping_generative/,0,MachineLearning
n62qhn,[R] Do You Even Need Attention? A Stack of Feed-Forward Layers Does Surprisingly Well on ImageNet,"TL;DR: Got scooped by MLP-Mixer, so I'm releasing my writeup/code/models. I hope someone finds them interesting/useful.

Lately I've been trying a couple variants of simple vision transformers to better understand what makes them perform well. About a month ago, I found that you could replace the attention layers with feed-forward layers and get quite good results. Last week I started a short writeup of the experiment (just a few pages, as I didn't see it as a full paper).

Today Google put out a paper (MLP-Mixer) that proposes exactly the same architecture.

When I saw the paper earlier today I considered scrapping what I had done, but now I figure that I might as well just put it out there.

For those who are interested, here's a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lukemelas/do-you-even-need-attention) with pretrained models, a [W&B log](https://wandb.ai/lukemelas2/deit-experiments/reports/Do-You-Even-Need-Attention---Vmlldzo2NjUxMzI?accessToken=8kebvweue0gd1s6qiav2orco97v85glogsi8i83576j42bb1g39e59px56lkk4zu) of the experiments, and a 3-page [writeup](https://github.com/lukemelas/do-you-even-need-attention/blob/main/Do-You-Even-Need-Attention.pdf).

Also, if anyone has stories about getting scooped, feel free to share -- I'd imagine people have some crazy stories.

t45n67,[D] Quitting machine learning for good,"Hi everyone,

I'm of those (rare??) persons who does ML for a living but has no interest in doing it. I've built models using classical and deep learning approaches for 7-8 years, and a lot of them had decent impacts in the companies I've worked with. I'm good at what I do and I'm compensated well for it. However, nothing in the field of ML/DL excites me anymore.

I find it more enjoyable to solve problems in my math textbooks . In fact, I want a career in which I can do some form of mathematics but I don't want to do machine learning for the rest of my life. Before I shifted to ML for the money, I worked a lot on satellite systems engineering. I also took a lot of physics and EE courses during my masters degree (optics, quantum mechanics and solid state devices).

I was thinking of a career in quantum information but I don't have a PhD yet. Also, my computer science skills aren't strong enough to switch to cryptography. Any thoughts / ideas on how to get out of machine learning?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: 2nd March, 2022 \[1\]- Thanks a lot everyone for your answers/comments. I'm overwhelmed and humbled by your responses. I'll reply to each one of you during this week or the next, whenever I find some time. I'm caught up in something personal.

\[2\] I came across this course recently - [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/6838\_spring\_2021.html](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/6838_spring_2021.html). This one looks super exciting. Here's a course on discrete differential geometry that I found online -  [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/\~kmcrane/Projects/DDG/](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DDG/). I'd love to explore differential geometry applied to ML problems (or vice versa).

\[3\]  I would prefer to work on ML in fields like applied physics or genetics rather than banking, social media analytics or consumer electronics.

\[4\] (This is a short rant)-  I'm sick of technical papers that have titles like ""X is all you need"" or ""Your classifier is secretly an energy based model and you should treat it like one"". I have nothing against anyone here and I'm absolutely certain that the authors are 100000x more knowledgable than I am but I'm very uncomfortable with such pompous paper titles. Correct me if I'm wrong but I haven't seen catchy titles in physics or mathematics. This is one (trivial) reason why I don't want to pursue a PhD in ML. I hate the grandeur and style!!

\[5\] Rant 2- Taking any online course from any platform does NOT make you a data scientist or an ML researcher. I hate the fact that not many of them are not willing to put in the time/effort to learn the fundamental math behind ML algorithms. When I ask someone in an interview to explain what PCA is, they stop with the answer that PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique. No word about eigenvalues/eigenvectors or covariance matrix. :(

11fbccz,[D] OpenAI introduces ChatGPT and Whisper APIs (ChatGPT API is 1/10th the cost of GPT-3 API),"https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis

> It is priced at $0.002 per 1k tokens, which is 10x cheaper than our existing GPT-3.5 models.

This is a massive, massive deal. For context, the reason GPT-3 apps took off over the past few months before ChatGPT went viral is because a) text-davinci-003 was released and was a significant performance increase and b) the cost was cut from $0.06/1k tokens to $0.02/1k tokens, which made consumer applications feasible without a large upfront cost.

A much better model and a 1/10th cost warps the economics completely to the point that it may be better than in-house finetuned LLMs.

1c2x5mx,"[D] Folks here have no idea how competitive top PhD program admissions are these days, wow...","I'm a CS PhD student, and I see the profiles of everyone admitted to our school (and similar top schools) these days since I'm right in the center of everything (and have been for years). 

I'm reading the comments on the [other thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/s/o1CLXtdxh8) and honestly shocked. So many ppl believe the post is fake and I see comments saying things like ""you don't even need top conference papers to get into top PhD programs"" (this is incorrect). I feel like many folks here are not up-to-date with just how competitive admissions are to top PhD programs these days...

In fact I'm not surprised. The top programs look at much more than simply publications. Incredibly strong LOR from famous/respected professors and personal connections to the faculty you want to work with are MUCH more important. Based on what they said (how they worked on the papers by themselves and don't have good recs), they have neither of these two most important things...

FYI most of the PhD admits in my year had 7+ top conference papers (some with best paper awards), hundreds of citations, tons of research exp, masters at top schools like CMU or UW or industry/AI residency experience at top companies like Google or OpenAI, rec letters from famous researchers in the world, personal connections, research awards, talks for top companies or at big events/conferences, etc... These top programs are choosing the **top students to admit from the entire world**.

The folks in the comments have no idea how competitive NLP is (which I assume is the original OP's area since they mentioned EMNLP). Keep in mind this was before the ChatGPT boom too, so things now are probably even more competitive...

Also pasting a comment I wrote on a similar thread months back:

""PhD admissions are incredibly competitive, especially at top schools. Most admits to top ML PhD programs these days have multiple publications, numerous citations, incredibly strong LoR from respected researchers/faculty, personal connections to the faculty they want to work with, other research-related activities and achievements/awards, on top of a good GPA and typically coming from a top school already for undergrad/masters.

Don't want to scare/discourage you but just being completely honest and transparent. It gets worse each year too (competition rises exponentially), and I'm usually encouraging folks who are just getting into ML research (with hopes/goals of pursuing a PhD) with no existing experience and publications to maybe think twice about it or consider other options tbh.

It does vary by subfield though. For example, areas like NLP and vision are incredibly competitive, but machine learning theory is relatively less so.""

Edit1: FYI I don't agree with this either. It's insanely unhealthy and overly competitive. However there's no choice when the entire world is working so hard in this field and there's so many ppl in it... These top programs admit the best people due to limited spots, and they can't just reject better people for others.

Edit2: some folks saying u don't need so many papers/accomplishments to get in. That's true if you have personal connections or incredibly strong letters from folks that know the target faculty well. In most cases this is not the case, so you need more pubs to boost your profile. Honestly these days, you usually need both (connections/strong letters plus papers/accomplishments).

Edit3: for folks asking about quality over quantity, I'd say quantity helps you get through the earlier admission stages (as there are way too many applicants so they have to use ""easy/quantifiable metrics"" to filter like number of papers - unless you have things like connections or strong letters from well-known researchers), but later on it's mainly quality and research fit, as individual faculty will review profiles of students (and even read some of their papers in-depth) and conduct 1-on-1 interviews. So quantity is one thing that helps get you to the later stages, but quality (not just of your papers, but things like rec letters and your actual experience/potential) matters much more for the final admission decision.

Edit4: like I said, this is field/area dependent. CS as a whole is competitive, but ML/AI is another level. Then within ML/AI, areas like NLP and Vision are ridiculous. It also depends what schools and labs/profs you are targeting, research fit, connections, etc. Not a one size fits all. But my overall message is that things are just crazy competitive these days as a whole, although there will be exceptions.

Edit5: not meant to be discouraging as much as honest and transparent so folks know what to expect and won't be as devastated with results, and also apply smarter (e.g. to more schools/labs including lower-ranked ones and to industry positions). Better to keep more options open in such a competitive field during these times...

Edit6: IMO most important things for top ML PhD admissions: connections and research fit with the prof >= rec letters (preferably from top researchers or folks the target faculty know well) > publications (quality) > publications (quantity) >= your overall research experiences and accomplishments > SOP (as long as overall research fit, rec letters, and profile are strong, this is less important imo as long as it's not written poorly) >>> GPA (as long as it's decent and can make the normally generous cutoff you'll be fine) >> GRE/whatever test scores (normally also cutoff based and I think most PhD programs don't require them anymore since Covid)",568,246,MLPhDStudent,2024-04-13 08:29:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1c2x5mx/d_folks_here_have_no_idea_how_competitive_top_phd/,0,MachineLearning

I trained every single SOTA model from 2021 and accidentally got a silver medal on an image classification competition on Kaggle recently (Pawpularity Contest). 

> [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/the-nuclear-option-train) If you are interested

The idea was to train every SOTA and then **Nuke the leaderboard with 10 Billion parameters** ensemble of ensembles. 
Some ensembles were also supplemented a bit with catboost 2nd stage model just for the ""why not"". 

**Outline of the approach: https://i.ibb.co/McJ39mW/image-nuke.png**

This stunt was done mainly for the purpose me catching up with the current most recent SOTA vision papers. 

I seriously didn't try to compete on the leaderboard and never had the intention of releasing a public notebook that actually gets a silver medal. 
This came as a complete surprise to me! 
Hope the solution will be useful for many others in the future.

l0l0oc,[P] Datasets should behave like Git repositories,"Let's talk about datasets for machine learning that change over time.

In real-life projects, datasets are rarely static. They grow, change, and evolve over time. But this fact is not reflected in how most datasets are maintained. Taking inspiration from software dev, where codebases are managed using Git, we can create living Git repositories for our datasets as well.

This means the dataset becomes easily manageable, and sharing, collaborating, and updating downstream consumers of changes to the data can be done similar to how we manage PIP or NPM packages.

I wrote a blog about such a project, showcasing how to transform a dataset into a *living-dataset,* and use it in a machine learning project.

195q6lu,[R] Google DeepMind Diagnostic LLM Exceeds Human Doctor Top-10 Accuracy (59% vs 34%),"Researchers from Google and DeepMind have developed and evaluated an LLM fine-tuned specifically for clinical diagnostic reasoning. In a new study, they rigorously tested the LLM's aptitude for generating differential diagnoses and aiding physicians.

They assessed the LLM on 302 real-world case reports from the New England Journal of Medicine. These case reports are known to be highly complex diagnostic challenges.

The LLM produced differential diagnosis lists that included the final confirmed diagnosis in the top 10 possibilities in 177 out of 302 cases, a top-10 accuracy of 59%. **This significantly exceeded the performance of experienced physicians, who had a top-10 accuracy of just 34% on the same cases when unassisted.**

According to assessments from senior specialists, the LLM's differential diagnoses were also rated to be **substantially more appropriate and comprehensive** than those produced by physicians, when evaluated across all 302 case reports.

This research demonstrates the potential for LLMs to enhance physicians' clinical reasoning abilities for complex cases. However, the authors emphasize that further rigorous real-world testing is essential before clinical deployment. Issues around model safety, fairness, and robustness must also be addressed.

b9iyi6,[N] Apple hires Ian Goodfellow,"*According to CNBC [article](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/04/apple-hires-ai-expert-ian-goodfellow-from-google.html):*

One of Google’s top A.I. people just joined Apple

- Ian Goodfellow joined Apple’s Special Projects Group as a director of machine learning last month.

- Prior to Google, he worked at OpenAI, an AI research consortium originally funded by Elon Musk and other tech notables.

- He is the father of an AI approach known as general adversarial networks, or GANs, and his research is widely cited in AI literature.

Ian Goodfellow, one of the top minds in artificial intelligence at Google, has joined Apple in a director role.

The hire comes as Apple increasingly strives to tap AI to boost its software and hardware. Last year Apple hired John Giannandrea, head of AI and search at Google, to supervise AI strategy.


Goodfellow updated his LinkedIn profile on Thursday to acknowledge that he moved from Google to Apple in March. He said he’s a director of machine learning in the Special Projects Group. In addition to developing AI for features like FaceID and Siri, Apple also has been working on autonomous driving technology. Recently the autonomous group had a round of layoffs.

A Google spokesperson confirmed his departure. Apple declined to comment. Goodfellow didn’t respond to a request for comment.

At the same time, there are some incredible results out there applying techniques like distillation, pruning, and quantization. I'd love for it to be standard practice to apply these techniques to more projects to see just how small and efficient we can make models.

The recording is now live (+ slides in the description!): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF53xsT7mjc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF53xsT7mjc)

Here I have made efforts to derive GNNs from first principles, motivate their use across the sciences, and explain how they emerged, in parallel, along several research lines. This represents a 'convergence' of the \~4 years I've spent studying GNNs: I taught them in many ways over the years, and I feel like I have finally found, imho, the most 'natural' way to introduce them.

*(For the amazing insights in this direction, I need to give a shout-out to my ongoing collaborators: Joan Bruna, Michael Bronstein and Taco Cohen!)*

The live Zoom session attracted \~500 people, and I received many emails afterwards in support of the talk -- hence I believe it could be both of use to beginners in the area, and offer a new perspective to seasoned GNN practitioners.

k6467v,[N] The email that got Ethical AI researcher Timnit Gebru fired,"Here is the email (according to platformer), I will post the source in a comment:

Hi friends,

I had stopped writing here as you may know, after all the micro and macro aggressions and harassments I received after posting my stories here (and then of course it started being moderated).


Recently however, I was contributing to a document that Katherine and Daphne were writing where they were dismayed by the fact that after all this talk, this org seems to have hired 14% or so women this year. Samy has hired 39% from what I understand but he has zero incentive to do this.


What I want to say is stop writing your documents because it doesn’t make a difference. The DEI OKRs that we don’t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the “we need more mentorship” rather than “we need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing” the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don’t matter. Because there is zero accountability. There is no incentive to hire 39% women: your life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset when they don’t want to give you good ratings during calibration. There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything. We just had a Black research all hands with such an emotional show of exasperation. Do you know what happened since? Silencing in the most fundamental way possible.


Have you ever heard of someone getting “feedback” on a paper through a privileged and confidential document to HR? Does that sound like a standard procedure to you or does it just happen to people like me who are constantly dehumanized?


Imagine this: You’ve sent a paper for feedback to 30+ researchers, you’re awaiting feedback from PR & Policy who you gave a heads up before you even wrote the work saying “we’re thinking of doing this”, working on a revision plan figuring out how to address different feedback from people, haven’t heard from PR & Policy besides them asking you for updates (in 2 months). A week before you go out on vacation, you see a meeting pop up at 4:30pm PST on your calendar (this popped up at around 2pm). No one would tell you what the meeting was about in advance. Then in that meeting your manager’s manager tells you “it has been decided” that you need to retract this paper by next week, Nov. 27, the week when almost everyone would be out (and a date which has nothing to do with the conference process). You are not worth having any conversations about this, since you are not someone whose humanity (let alone expertise recognized by journalists, governments, scientists, civic organizations such as the electronic frontiers foundation etc) is acknowledged or valued in this company.


Then, you ask for more information. What specific feedback exists? Who is it coming from? Why now? Why not before? Can you go back and forth with anyone? Can you understand what exactly is problematic and what can be changed?


And you are told after a while, that your manager can read you a privileged and confidential document and you’re not supposed to even know who contributed to this document, who wrote this feedback, what process was followed or anything. You write a detailed document discussing whatever pieces of feedback you can find, asking for questions and clarifications, and it is completely ignored. And you’re met with, once again, an order to retract the paper with no engagement whatsoever.


Then you try to engage in a conversation about how this is not acceptable and people start doing the opposite of any sort of self reflection—trying to find scapegoats to blame.


Silencing marginalized voices like this is the opposite of the NAUWU principles which we discussed. And doing this in the context of “responsible AI” adds so much salt to the wounds. I understand that the only things that mean anything at Google are levels, I’ve seen how my expertise has been completely dismissed. But now there’s an additional layer saying any privileged person can decide that they don’t want your paper out with zero conversation. So you’re blocked from adding your voice to the research community—your work which you do on top of the other marginalization you face here.


I’m always amazed at how people can continue to do thing after thing like this and then turn around and ask me for some sort of extra DEI work or input. This happened to me last year. I was in the middle of a potential lawsuit for which Kat Herller and I hired feminist lawyers who threatened to sue Google (which is when they backed off--before that Google lawyers were prepared to throw us under the bus and our leaders were following as instructed) and the next day I get some random “impact award.” Pure gaslighting.


So if you would like to change things, I suggest focusing on leadership accountability and thinking through what types of pressures can also be applied from the outside. For instance, I believe that the Congressional Black Caucus is the entity that started forcing tech companies to report their diversity numbers. Writing more documents and saying things over and over again will tire you out but no one will listen.


Timnit

---------------------------------
Below is Jeff Dean's message sent out to Googlers on Thursday morning


Hi everyone,


I’m sure many of you have seen that Timnit Gebru is no longer working at Google. This is a difficult moment, especially given the important research topics she was involved in, and how deeply we care about responsible AI research as an org and as a company.


Because there’s been a lot of speculation and misunderstanding on social media, I wanted to share more context about how this came to pass, and assure you we’re here to support you as you continue the research you’re all engaged in.


Timnit co-authored a paper with four fellow Googlers as well as some external collaborators that needed to go through our review process (as is the case with all externally submitted papers). We’ve approved dozens of papers that Timnit and/or the other Googlers have authored and then published, but as you know, papers often require changes during the internal review process (or are even deemed unsuitable for submission). Unfortunately, this particular paper was only shared with a day’s notice before its deadline — we require two weeks for this sort of review — and then instead of awaiting reviewer feedback, it was approved for submission and submitted.
A cross functional team then reviewed the paper as part of our regular process and the authors were informed that it didn’t meet our bar for publication and were given feedback about why. It ignored too much relevant research — for example, it talked about the environmental impact of large models, but disregarded subsequent research showing much greater efficiencies.  Similarly, it raised concerns about bias in language models, but didn’t take into account recent research to mitigate these issues. We acknowledge that the authors were extremely disappointed with the decision that Megan and I ultimately made, especially as they’d already submitted the paper. 
Timnit responded with an email requiring that a number of conditions be met in order for her to continue working at Google, including revealing the identities of every person who Megan and I had spoken to and consulted as part of the review of the paper and the exact feedback. Timnit wrote that if we didn’t meet these demands, she would leave Google and work on an end date. We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google.
Given Timnit's role as a respected researcher and a manager in our Ethical AI team, I feel badly that Timnit has gotten to a place where she feels this way about the work we’re doing. I also feel badly that hundreds of you received an email just this week from Timnit telling you to stop work on critical DEI programs. Please don’t. I understand the frustration about the pace of progress, but we have important work ahead and we need to keep at it.


I know we all genuinely share Timnit’s passion to make AI more equitable and inclusive. No doubt, wherever she goes after Google, she’ll do great work and I look forward to reading her papers and seeing what she accomplishes.
Thank you for reading and for all the important work you continue to do.

ezv3f2,[P] GPT-2 + BERT reddit replier. I built a system that generates replies by taking output from GPT-2 and using BERT models to select the most realistic replies. People on r/artificial replied to it as if it were a person.,"I was trying to make a reddit reply bot with GPT-2 to see if it could pass as a human on reddit.  I realized that a decent fraction of the output was looking pretty weird so I wanted to improve on the results.  I came up with this method:

[Method Overview](https://preview.redd.it/l2xenzvlxbf41.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc6df001c76f8c498e3268455ba0bc53fd3923f4)

Since I don't have the kind of compute to train new things from scratch, I just took a pretrained BERT and fine-tuned it to detect real from GPT-2 generated. Then I used the BERT model as a filter (kind of like a GAN but without the feedback between generator and discriminator).  I also aded a BERT model to try to predict which comment would get the most upvotes.

Several people replied to the output replies as if it was a real person so I think it probably passes a light Turing sniff test (maybe they were bots too, who knows?).  Hopefully nobody gets too mad that I tested the model in the wild. I ran it sparingly and made sure it wasn't saying anything inflammatory.

I wrote up a [results overview](https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/) and a [tutorial post](https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/reddit-bot-gpt2-bert/) to explain how it works.  And I put all of my code on [github](https://github.com/lots-of-things/gpt2-bert-reddit-bot) and on [Colab](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1by97qt6TBpi_o644uKnYmQE5AJB1ybMK).

The thing I like most about this method is that it mirrors how I actually write replies too.  In my head, I generate a couple of ideas and then pick between them after the fact with my ""inner critic.""

Hope you enjoy it and if you want to play with it, please only use it for good.",551,63,bonkerfield,2020-02-06 16:51:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ezv3f2/p_gpt2_bert_reddit_replier_i_built_a_system_that/,0,MachineLearning

qrbkc7,[D] Calling out the authors of 'Trajformer' paper for claiming they published code but never doing it,"I read a paper from NeurIPS 2020 titled 'Trajformer: Trajectory Prediction with Local Self-Attentive Contexts for Autonomous Driving'. I found it interesting and the authors claim multiple times in the paper that 'we release our code at '[https://github.com/Manojbhat09/Trajformer](https://github.com/Manojbhat09/Trajformer)'. Turns out they never did, fine, I thought perhaps they will in the future and starred the repo to check it out later.

Many others raised issues asking for update on code release and they never replied. Finally, it April they update the readme to say that they will release the code and that's been the last update.

I know this is a common trend in ML papers now, but what sucks is that I emailed the authors (both the grad student and the PI) multiple times asking for an update an they never replied. Their paper is literally based on empirical improvements and without working code to replicate the results it is their word against mine.

I strongly think things have to change, and I believe they only will if we call them out. I waited long enough, and made significant effort to contact the authors with no response. I mean I don't mind them not releasing their code, but at least don't claim that you did in the paper/review phase and then disappear. An undergrad in my lab asked why she should take time to clean up the code and document it before release while others just move on to the next interesting project and I don't have an answer.

ea2gap,[D] NeurIPS 2019 Bengio Schmidhuber Meta-Learning Fiasco,"The recent reddit post [Yoshua Bengio talks about what's next for deep learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/e92dp5/d_yoshua_bengio_talks_about_whats_next_for_deep/) links to an interview with Bengio. User u/panties_in_my_ass got many upvotes for this comment: 

>Spectrum: What's the key to that kind of adaptability?***  
>  
>Bengio: [Meta-learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03030.pdf) is a very hot topic these days: Learning to learn. I wrote an [early paper on this](http://bengio.abracadoudou.com/publications/pdf/bengio_1991_ijcnn.pdf) in 1991, but only recently did we get the computational power to implement this kind of thing.  
>  
>Somewhere, on some laptop, Schmidhuber is screaming at his monitor right now.

because he introduced meta-learning 4 years before Bengio: 

Jürgen Schmidhuber. Evolutionary principles in self-referential learning, or on learning how to learn: The meta-meta-... hook. Diploma thesis, Tech Univ. Munich, 1987.

Then Bengio gave his [NeurIPS 2019 talk](https://slideslive.com/38921750/from-system-1-deep-learning-to-system-2-deep-learning). Slide 71 says:

>Meta-learning or learning to learn (Bengio et al 1991; Schmidhuber 1992)

u/y0hun commented:

>What a childish slight... The Schmidhuber 1987 paper is clearly labeled and established and as a nasty slight he juxtaposes his paper against Schmidhuber with his preceding it by a year almost doing the opposite of giving him credit.

I detect a broader pattern here. Look at this highly upvoted post: [Jürgen Schmidhuber really had GANs in 1990](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/djju8a/d_jurgen_schmidhuber_really_had_gans_in_1990/), 25 years before Bengio. u/siddarth2947 commented that

>GANs were actually mentioned in the Turing laudation, it's both funny and sad that Yoshua Bengio got a Turing award for a principle that Jurgen invented decades before him

and that section 3 of Schmidhuber's [post on their miraculous year 1990-1991](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html) is actually about his former student Sepp Hochreiter and Bengio:

> (In 1994, others published results [VAN2] essentially identical to the 1991 vanishing gradient results of Sepp [VAN1]. Even after a common publication [VAN3], the first author of reference [VAN2] published papers (e.g., [VAN4]) that cited only his own 1994 paper but not Sepp's original work.)

So Bengio republished at least 3 important ideas from Schmidhuber's lab without giving credit: meta-learning, vanishing gradients, GANs.

Hi Reddit,

I'm excited to share with you our latest work, [\[2203.03466\] Tensor Programs V: Tuning Large Neural Networks via Zero-Shot Hyperparameter Transfer (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03466).

Code: [https://github.com/microsoft/mup](https://t.co/5S0YAghCYx)

  


https://preview.redd.it/nnb2usdjlkm81.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca9e6d5cddfbea5675cf00854806d5189c3e40bb

(Disclaimer: this post is shamelessly converted from my twitter thread)

The idea is actually really simple: in a special parametrization introduced in [our previous work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14522) ([reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/k8h01q/r_wide_neural_networks_are_feature_learners_not/)) called µP, narrow and wide neural networks share the same set of optimal hyperparameters. This works even as width -> ∞.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dqna8guklkm81.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f7ba582a1cc949461dac8601a896034eaf0ff84

The hyperparameters can include learning rate, learning rate schedule, initialization, parameter multipliers, and more, even individually for each parameter tensor. We empirically verified this on Transformers up to width 4096.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rwdsb6snlkm81.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3152f2746132d92dc3788a42aa6926a61d7c46f

Using this insight, we can just tune a tiny version of GPT-3 on a single GPU --- if the hyperparameters we get on the small model is near optimal, then they should also be near optimal on the large model! We call this way of tuning \*µTransfer\*.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mi7ibyyolkm81.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=144af103b2aaf3ffeb2ccf19aad7565527dbd003

We µTransferred hyperparameters from a small 40 million parameter version of GPT-3 — small enough to fit on a single GPU — to the 6.7 billion version. With some asterisks, we get a performance comparable to the original GPT-3 model with twice the parameter count!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rrq2yfwplkm81.png?width=3232&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cf4cc9652db48e12b48a85b2f837e55e64bd09c

The total tuning cost is only 7% of the whole pretrain compute cost! Since the direct tuning of the small model costs roughly the same even as the large model increases in size, tuning the 175B GPT-3 this way would probably cost at most 0.3% of the total pretrain compute.

You: ""wait can I shrink the model only in width?""

Bad news: there's not much theoretical guarantee for non-width stuff

good news: we empirically tested transfer across depth, batch size, sequence length, & timestep work within reasonable ranges on preLN transformers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x7fo95yqlkm81.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1935bf10f1524f9da3df0cc2e95ae1ec9b805f37

We applied this to tune BERT-base and BERT-large simultaneously by shrinking them to the same small model in both width and depth, where we did the direct tuning. We got a really nice improvement over the already well-tuned megatron BERT baseline, especially for BERT-large!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/db5eausrlkm81.png?width=1687&format=png&auto=webp&s=4453ec387477d20cbcdab266ccbc8e36032c87fd

In general, it seems that the larger a model is, the less well tuned it is --- which totally makes sense --- and thus the more to gain from µTransfer. We didn't have compute to retrain the GPT-3 175B model, but I'll leave your mouth watering with that thought.

OK, so what actually is µP and how do you implement it?

It's encapsulated by the following table for how to scale your initialization and learning rate with fan-in or fan-out. The purple text is µP and the gray text in parenthesis is pytorch default, for reference, and the black text is shared by both.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4475drzvlkm81.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=b65f56ef2d8c24f077a24a8df40eb7f98c80f7e2

But just like you don't typically want to implement autograd by hand even though autograd is just chain rule, we recommend using our package [https://github.com/microsoft/mup](https://t.co/5S0YAg026Z) to implement µP in your models.

The really curious ones of you: ""OK what is the theoretical motivation behind all this?""

Unfortunately, this is already getting long, so feel free to check out the [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/k8h01q/r_wide_neural_networks_are_feature_learners_not/) on [our previous theoretical paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14522), and people let me know if this is something you want to hear for another time!

But I have to say that this is a rare occasion in deep learning where very serious mathematics has concretely delivered a result previously unthinkable, and I'm elated with how things turned out! In contrast to [this reddit thread a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/t8fn7m/d_are_we_at_the_end_of_an_era_where_ml_could_be/), I think there are plenty of room for new, fundamental mathematics to change the direction of deep learning and artificial intelligence in general --- why chase the coattail of empirical research trying to ""explain"" them all when you can lead the field with deep theoretical insights?

razsj2,[D] Why do people “read” as many papers as possible?,"I’ve got a few colleagues who always claim to be reading papers, but the way they “read” is so damn superficial. 

As an example, I had just finished fully reading/comprehending a paper, and I won’t lie, took me a solid couple days to understand everything fully and reading things multiple times. 

Meanwhile, in the daily meetings we have I mention the paper and how we should try and use some of their components in our own work, and someone says, “oh ya, I read that in like 15 mins”. So we decide to have an impromptu discussion on it and Jesus Christ, I swear the only thing he read was the abstract and maybe glanced at the network architecture. 

I’m sorry this is turning into an rant, it just really grates my nerves when people say they read something and in reality all they did was look at the abstract. 

I’m a firm believe that reading, comprehending and fully understand 1 single “key” paper from whatever field you’re studying, is a much better investment of your time than skimming through 100 regurgitated ideas.

Edit: guys just to clarify, I do believe in skimming abstracts and looking for interesting papers. I go through dozens a day myself.  You’d be lost otherwise haha.

I decided that it was better bang for my buck to learn data science than in would every be to continue on in the weak education system we have globally. I paid 30 dollars month, for a year, to pick up the skills to get into data science. I landed a great job, paying a great salary because I took advantage of these types of opportunities.

r8tsv6,[Discussion] Why are Einstein Sum Notations not popular in ML? They changed my life.,"I recently discovered \`torch.einsum\` and now I am mad at every friend, mentor, acquaintance for not telling me about it. 

They are just way more intuitive and can handle most operations that I would want to do with tensors so elegantly. No more of having to remember which way is axis=0, No more of having to remember which way is dim=1 and no more of remembering so many numpy and torch functions only to misuse np.unsqueeze and torch.expand\_dims. 

It takes only 30 mins or so to learn the notation and become somewhat proficient but then you are sorted for life. 

What are the arguments for and against using einstein notations for everything? Will I be writing code which others find difficult to understand?

43fl90,Synopsis of top Go professional's analysis of Google's Deepmind's Go AI,"Hi there. Earlier this month I had [a discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3zdibn/intelligent_agents_for_hearthstone/cylnbf2) over on /r/hearthstone with /u/yetipirate about Computer Go. Then the news hit this week of the first Go AI to beat a human professional.

We had some more discussion then, and I made a synopsis of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHRHUHW6HQE), where the US Go Association has Myungwan Kim, 9-Dan Pro, analyse the games between the AlphaGo AI and human professional Fan Hui, 2-Dan Pro. (FTR: Professional go ranks start at 1-Dan and go up to 9-Dan, but rather than the absolute top 9-Dan is more like the beginning of grandmastery. The best players in the world are like 9-Dan+++++. Lee Sedol, which AlphaGo will challenge next this March, is at this latter level.)

/u/yetipirate suggested this synopsis might interest some people here as well, since it digests the salient points of a two hour video with lots of Go jargon into a more manageable post. So hence I'm posting it here, I hope you all enjoy it. Feel free to ask me any questions about Go, but I'm not that strong myself so ymmv. Anyway without further ado:

**In General:**

The match has been big news in East-Asia as well. The thing which most shocked all the professionals was that AlphaGo played so much like a human player. Their first impressions were that it's as if this was a human playing, not a computer.

Since how a human plays is, obviously, pretty well known, they decided that they'll focus commentary mostly on those cases where AlphaGo doesn't play like a human.

The first thing that Myungwan Kim noted was that AlphaGo has a Japanese playstyle (this is especially interesting because among the three traditional Go powerhouses, China, Korea, and Japan, the Japanese have been the weakest in international competitions for the past several decades). The commentators don't know, but they suspect it is that the original human data set was biased towards Japanese playstyles.

Myungwan Kim also makes a comment about one of the lines continually repeated in the coverage of Computer Go. The line that ""if you ask a top Go player why they like a certain move, they'll often say 'it felt right'"". Myungwan Kim wanted to add that just because it's based on intuition, doesn't mean there's no logic behind it at all. Top Go players aren't just guessing what are good moves, they have a real and complicated rational understanding about what specific moves are doing. Even if the final decision might come down to which move feels the best, it's not as simple as top pro's just doing a random move and saying 'I felt like it'.

**The Games:**

In the **first game** both sides played very passively in the opening. Leisurely and gentle they say.

Myungwan Kim finds that AlphaGo has a weakness here, it doesn't seem to understand the value of taking and holding initiative. Complicated to explain, but at its core it's about doing moves which force your opponent to use their turn to react to your move over doing moves which might be equally valuable to you, but leave your opponent free to do whatever they want on their turn.

Important, Myungwan Kim says because of this that the first game Fan Hui was winning in the opening. He says this was the only game Fan Hui was winning after the opening. He estimates Fan Hui was about 10 points ahead, and can't see white getting back even 5 points coming out of that opening. Myungwan Kim offers some alternate moves for AlphaGo which would still have Fan Hui in the lead, but would've given AlphaGo better opportunities to comeback.

Conclusion from the opening: AlphaGo lost because it didn't understand the value of initiative.

Myungwan Kim later points to one huge mistake by Fan Hui in the midgame that lost him the game. I can't go into detail here because, as characteristic of top-level Go, it's the difference of placing one stone one space higher. But Myungwan Kim says that while Fan Hui made other small mistakes, this one move is the big one which let AlphaGo come back from losing the opening.

Final conclusion from game one: Aside from not understanding initiative. Myungwan Kim says AlphaGo betrays itself as a computer in that it sometimes it goes too far in mimicking standard professional play and does the most common move instead of the most optimal move. In other words, it's extremely book smart, but at times fails to notice when it should be ignoring the books because the specific situation in the game makes the less standard move the most optimal one instead. (A bit cliche imo, but Myungwan Kim says ""AlphaGo is not creative"".) They think that might really hurt AlphaGo in the game against Lee Sedol.

**Game 2**, they note Fan Hui really played too aggressively, as he noted in his own post-match interview. Myungwan Kim says he can really see Fan Hui wasn't playing his best game, but was trying to test AlphaGo to see if it could be tricked into making exploitable mistakes.

Myungwan Kim says Fan Hui actually put up a really good fight. After the opening it should've been over for Fan Hui, but AlphaGo almost allowed Fan Hui to get back in the game.

**Game 3** is similar to the fifth game, though Fan Hui played better in the beginning here. Myungwan Kim notes several moves by AlphaGo which are top professional moves. He notes some moves by Fan Hui which he thinks hints that Fan Hui might be a bit out of practice when it comes to playing professional level games (he says it's the kind of move you do if too used to playing teaching games against amateurs). Fan Hui lost because he played over-aggressive and left too many holes in his defence as a result.

On the **fifth game**, Myungwan Kim says AlphaGo was winning from the beginning here. They marvel at some of AlphaGo's moves here, but they're not sure whether AlphaGo really knew what it was doing or if it just got 'lucky' somehow.

Myungwan Kim points out AlphaGo made a huge mistake early in this game, but was saved because not long after Fan Hui made an equally huge mistake. But this is an example where he thinks a real grandmaster like Lee Sedol would not have allowed AlphaGo to get away with the kind of mistake it made there.

**AlphaGo's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

Myungwan Kim lists AlphaGo's strengths:

 * It's not afraid of 'Ko'. 'Ko' is too complex a concept to explain succinctly, for an attempt [see my post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/43fl90/synopsis_of_top_go_professionals_analysis_of/czi7swh). They marvel at some of AlphaGo's moves surrounding a 'Ko' situation, but aren't sure if AlphaGo really knew what it was doing or just got lucky that it worked out.

 * Reading might be AlphaGo's strength. As in, cases where it comes down to very straightforward fights and moves it's very strong at choosing the right moves.

Myungwan Kim lists AlphaGo's weaknesses:

 * Doesn't understand initiative, as explained earlier.

 * At times too obsessed with following common patterns, when the specific situation might require creative deviation from those patterns. Also explained earlier.

 * It doesn't understand 'Aji'. 'Aji' is difficult to explain, but it refers to the amount of uncertainty remaining in a specific grouping of white and black stones. (Usually, it's about the chance that a group of stones which is 'death' might become alive and vice versa as a result of things happening elsewhere on the board.) You can also put this differently as: AlphaGo lacks proper long-term thinking.

 * Myungwan Kim thinks AlphaGo has difficulty, or even doesn't at all, evaluating the value of specific stones. It's good at making moves which directly gain territory for itself, but tends to miss moves which reduce the value of the opponent's stones.

 * It can make really high level moves at times, but it doesn't understand those moves. Which it displays by making the right moves at the wrong time.

More generally Myungwan Kim thinks a weakness of AlphaGo is its insularity. He really stresses that human pro's become much stronger when they discuss and analyse their games with other pro's. And because AlphaGo primarily plays against itself the quality of the feedback it gets on its play is too one-note, which leaves holes in its plays whereas human pro's getting feedback from many other human pro's end up with more robust and stronger playstyles. He really thinks to progress past its current level AlphaGo needs to play more with top human pro's rather than just itself. Right now, Myungwan Kim en most pro's he knows don't feel threatened by AlphaGo. They also talk about how AlphaGo can be useful for human pro's to study and become stronger, which can make AlphaGo stronger in turn. (This last paragraph is imo all just Myungwan Kim musing based on his understanding of how AlphaGo was designed more than evaluating its plays themselves, so that's why I didn't list it as a bullet point.)

In general, I get the sense from Myungwan Kim's explanations that he thinks AlphaGo is stronger at the more concrete parts of Go play, such as territory and life-or-death, and weaker at the more vague concepts, such as influence and uncertainty.

e2jj8b,[D] Go champion Lee Se-dol beaten by DeepMind retires after declaring AI invincible,"[https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20191127004800315](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20191127004800315)

Announced today in South Korea, and it’s made me think on the sort of impact that these things will have on people in the coming days. There’s definitely a great deal of good that can be achieved, with innovation/growth and so many opportunities in general for the companies and people involved in this work.

But at the same time, it is kind of sad to see some of the human element get left behind. I’m sure Lee Se-dol could have played for many more years if he wanted to, continuing to contribute greatly to the professional Go scene as a player.

This is something that I wonder then, if people working at companies like Google / DeepMind should be thinking about. I’m sure the growing profit margins and money that’s flowing in from all our work is more than satisfactory for the company leadership / investors to not have any issues. As the engineers responsible for actually building everything though, is there any kind of ethical consideration on our part that we need to recognize? I don’t know.

...and so we asked a bunch of teams and got 41 of them to answer.

We got way more insights than we could handle but after grouping it into a few clusters of most-prevalent answers we got something like this:

* Software development setup
   * For IDE there are two camps: Jupyter Lab + NB extensions with occasional Deepnote, and Colab on one side and Pycharm or VSCode on the other ( R studio was a clear winner for R users)
   * Github for version control
   * Python (most) R (some)
* Machine Learning frameworks
   * Pandas + Matplotlib + Plotly for exploration and visualization
   * Sklearn + XGBoost for classical algos
   * Tensorflow+Keras or Pytorch (sometimes both at the same company) for deep learning. Pretty even split I'd say
* MLOps
   * Kubeflow, Airflow, Amazon Sagemaker, Azure for orchestration
   * Kubeflow, MLflow, Amazon Sagemaker, for model packaging/serving
   * pytest-benchmark, MLperf for profiling and optimization when moving models from training to inference
   * MLflow, Comet, Neptune for experiment management
* Unexpected 🙂

I was surprised to hear that even Andrew Ng has trouble reading certain papers at times and he reaches out to other experts to get help, so I guess that it's something most of us will probably always have to deal with to some extent or another. 

If you're having trouble with a particular paper, post it with the parts you are having trouble with, and hopefully me or someone else may help out. It'll be like a mini study group to extract as much valuable info from each paper. 

Even if it's a paper that you're not per say totally stuck on, but it's just that it'll take a while to completely figure out, post it anyway in case you find some value in shaving off some precious time in pursuing the total comprehension of that paper, so that you can more quickly move onto other papers. 

Edit:

Okay we got some papers. I'm going through them one by one. Please have specific questions on where exactly you are stuck, even if it's a big picture issue. Just say something like 'what's the big picture'. 

Edit 2:

Gotta to do some irl stuff but will continue helping out tomorrow. Some of the papers are outside my proficiency so hopefully some other people on the subreddit can help out. 

Edit 3:

Okay this really blew up. Some papers it's taking a really long time to figure out. 

Another request I have in addition to specific question, type out any additional info/brief summary that can help cut down on the time it will take for someone to answer the question. For example, if there's an equation whose components are explained through out the paper, make a mini glossary of said equation. Try to aim so that perhaps the reader doesn't even need to read the paper (likely not possible but aiming for this will make for excellent summary info) and they can answer your question. 

What attempts have you made so far to figure out the question. 

Finally, what is your best guess to what you think the answer might be, and why. 

Edit 4:

More people should participate in the papers, not just people who can answer the questions. If any of the papers listed are of interest to you, can you read them, and reply to the comment with your own questions about the paper, so that someone can answer both your questions. It might turn out that he person who posted the paper knows the question, and it even might be the case that you stumbled upon the answers to the original questions. 

Think of each paper as an invite to an open study group for that paper, not just a queue for an expert to come along and answer it. 

Edit 5:

It looks like people want this to be a weekly feature here. I'm going to figure out the best format from the comments here and make a proposal to the mods. 

Edit 6: 

I'm still going through the papers and giving answers. Even if I can't answer the question I'll reply with something, but it'll take a while. But please provide as much summary info as I described in the last edits to help me navigate through the papers and quickly collect as much background info I need to answer the question.

The claim is that [AGI](https://twitter.com/woj_zaremba/status/1105149945118519296) needs to be carefully and collaboratively guided into existence yet the output of almost [every](https://github.com/facebookresearch) [other](https://github.com/google-research/google-research) [existing](https://github.com/salesforce) [commercial](https://github.com/NVlabs) lab is more open. OpenAI runs a closed ecosystem where they primarily don't or won't trust outside of a small bubble.

I say this knowing many of the people there and with past and present love in my heart—I don't collaborate with OpenAI as I have no freaking clue what they're doing. Their primary form of communication is high entropy blog posts that'd be shock pivots for any normal start-up.

I have mentioned this to friends there and say all of this with positive sum intentions: I understand they have lofty aims, I understand they need cash to shovel into the forever unfurling GPU forge, but if they want any community trust long term they need a better strategy.

The implicit OpenAI message heard over the years:
“Think of how transformative and dangerous AGI may be. Terrifying. Trust us. Whether it's black-boxing technology, legal risk, policy initiatives, investor risk, ...—trust us with everything. We're good. No questions, sorry.”

b0rdsi,[D] Irresponsible anthropomorphism is killing AI journalism,"Basically the title.  The current state of media coverage of AI is fixated on constructing a compelling narrative to readers, and often personifies models well beyond their capabilities.  This is to the extent that articles almost always end up reading like every classifier is some form of limited AGI.

Take [""Meet Norman the Psychopathic AI""](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44040008), an article by the BBC, whom I generally consider quite capable journalists.  While the research methodology and some of the implications are discussed in the article, the majority of laypeople who encounter the article will likely erroneously conclude that Norman possesses beliefs, a worldview, and some dark outlook on humanity.  Some readers will think ""Norman"" is violent or dangerous, with a mind of his own.  A headline and an image go a long way in communication, especially online.

And this article is by far not the worst offender. Many news outlets perform much worse, publishing misleading, fearmongering, or sensationalist stories about ""some new AI"", borrowing from pop sci-fi tropes, with the star AI inevitably represented by lacklustre CG avatars bought off stock photo websites.

I remember having several discussions in the wake of the Facebook experiment where researchers had AIs communicate, and saw they developed a communication standard unreadable by humans.  Based on the articles that circulated afterwards, a significant number of people concluded ""they had to turn it off because they were on the verge of SKYNET"".

In the interests of doing more than just ranting: how do we deal with this as a community?  Should we be reaching out to journalists about these issues?  Is it our responsibility in interviews to communicate the limitations of the models we develop?

17mk3lx,[R] Telling GPT-4 you're scared or under pressure improves performance,"In a recent paper, researchers have discovered that LLMs show enhanced performance when provided with prompts infused with emotional context, which they call ""EmotionPrompts.""

These prompts incorporate sentiments of urgency or importance, such as ""It's crucial that I get this right for my thesis defense,"" as opposed to neutral prompts like ""Please provide feedback.""

The study's empirical evidence suggests substantial gains. This indicates a **significant sensitivity of LLMs to the implied emotional stakes** in a prompt:

* Deterministic tasks saw an 8% performance boost
* Generative tasks experienced a 115% improvement when benchmarked using BIG-Bench.
* Human evaluators further validated these findings, observing a 10.9% increase in the perceived quality of responses when EmotionPrompts were used.

This enhancement is attributed to the models' capacity to detect and prioritize the heightened language patterns that imply a need for precision and care in the response.

The research delineates the potential of EmotionPrompts to refine the effectiveness of AI in applications where understanding the user's intent and urgency is paramount, even though the AI does not genuinely comprehend or feel emotions.

**TLDR: Research shows LLMs deliver better results when prompts signal emotional urgency. This insight can be leveraged to improve AI applications by integrating EmotionPrompts into the design of user interactions.**

xk31n8,[P] My co-founder and I quit our engineering jobs at AWS to build “Tensor Search”. Here is why.,"My co-founder and I,  a senior Amazon research scientist and AWS SDE respectively, launched Marqo a little over a week ago - a ""tensor search"" engine [https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo)

**Another project doing semantic search/dense retrieval. Why??**

Semantic search using vectors does an amazing job when we look at sentences, or short paragraphs. Vectors also do well as an implementation for image search. Unfortunately, vector representations for video, long documents and other more complex data types perform poorly.

The reason isn't really to do with embeddings themselves not being good enough. If you asked a human to find the most relevant document to some search query given a list of long documents, an important question comes to mind - do we want the document that on average is most relevant to your query or the document that has a specific sentence that is very relevant to your search query?

Furthermore, what if the document has multiple components to it? Should we match based on the title of the document? Is that important? Or is the content more important?

These questions arn't things that we can expect an AI algorithm to solve for us, they need to be encoded into each specific search experience and use case.

**Introducing Tensor Search**

We believe that it is possible to tackle this problem by changing the way we think about semantic search - specifically, through *tensor search*.

By deconstructing documents and other data types into configurable chunks which are then vectorised we give users control over the way their documents are searched and represented. We can have any combination the user desires - should we do an average? A maximum? Weight certain components of the document more or less? Do we want to be more specific and target a specific sentence or less specific and look at the whole document?

Further, explainability is vastly improved - we can return as a ""highlight"" the exact content that matched the search query. Therefore, the user can see exactly where the query matched, even if they are dealing with long and complex data types like videos or long documents.

We dig in a bit more into the ML specifics next.

**The trouble with BERT on long documents - quadratic attention**

When we come to text, the vast majority of semantic search applications are using attention based algos like SBERT. Attention tapers off quadratically with sequence length, so subdividing sequences into multiple vectors means that we can significantly improve relevance.

**The disk space, relevance tradeoff**

Tensors allow you to trade disk space for search accuracy. You could retrain an SBERT model and increase the number of values in the embeddings and hence make the embeddings more descriptive, but this is quite costly (particularly if you want to leverage existing ML models). A better solution is instead to chunk the document into smaller components and vectorise those, increasing accuracy at the cost of disk space (which is relatively cheap).

**Tensor search for the general case**

We wanted to build a search engine for semantic search similar to something like Solr or Elasticsearch, where no matter what you throw at it, it can process it and make it searchable. With Marqo, it will use vectors were it can or expand to tensors where necessary - it also allows you the flexibility to specify specific chunking strategies to build out the tensors. Finally, Marqo is still a work in progress, but is at least something of an end-to-end solution - it has a number of features such as:

\- a query DSL language for pre-filtering results (includes efficient keyword, range and boolean queries)  
\- efficient approximate knn search powered by HNSW  
\- onnx support, multi-gpu support  
\- support for reranking

I love to hear feedback from the community! Don't hesitate to reach out on our slack channel (there is a link within the Marqo repo), or directly via linkedin: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-hamer-%F0%9F%A6%9B-04a6369b/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-hamer-%F0%9F%A6%9B-04a6369b/)",534,63,tomhamer5,2022-09-21 12:05:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xk31n8/p_my_cofounder_and_i_quit_our_engineering_jobs_at/,0,MachineLearning
co37ut,Regarding beginner's guides,"Hi all,


/r/machinelearning is growing rampantly, with over a thousand new subscribers *every day*. As our community grows, it is important to have fertile ground for newcomers to learn the ropes. Since there is already an active subreddit for aiding in the development of machine learning skills, we feel that this is the right time to demarcate the content between these two subs.


As a new rule, all beginner-level content should be posted to our sister sub, /r/learnmachinelearning.  This will free up “real estate” on our page for more in-depth, expert discussions and provide a more focused learning space for beginners.  That’s not to say that all tutorials are outright banned — in particular, explanations of recent or niche papers are still welcome.

We were all beginners once and newcomers to ML are bringing great things to this sub and the general community. Please do continue to engage with and learn from the community here. But we recommend /r/learnmachinelearning if you do want to start getting your hands dirty. 

We hope that this specialization will be beneficial to everyone in the long run.

m5miai,[R] SpeechBrain is out. A PyTorch Speech Toolkit.,"Hi everyone,

We are thrilled to announce the public release of SpeechBrain (finally)!SpeechBrain is an open-source toolkit designed to speedup research and development of speech technologies.  It is flexible, modular, easy-to-use and well documented.

[https://speechbrain.github.io/](https://speechbrain.github.io/?fbclid=IwAR289EnrgVB9UG_yJFDu_K36kG321wCFiwu1n9D-dOc7-zfDb4sATMKRk5k)

Our amazing collaborators worked so hard for more than one year and we hope our efforts will be helpful for the speech and machine learning communities.

SpeechBrain currently supports speech recognition, speaker recognition, verification and diarization, spoken language understanding, speech enhancement, speech separation and multi-microphone signal processing. For all these tasks we have competitive or state-of-the-art performance (see [https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain)).

SpeechBrain can foster research on speech technology.  It can be useful for pure machine learning scientists as well as companies or students that can easily plug their model into SpeechBrain.

We think that speechbrain can also be suitable for beginners. According to our experience and numerous beta testers,  you just need few hours to familiarize yourself with the toolkit.  To you in this process, we prepared many interactive tutorials (Google Colab).

Pretrained models are available on HuggingFace so anyone can do ASR, speaker verification, source separation or more with only a few lines of code! ([https://huggingface.co/speechbrain](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain))

**How does it work?**

I’ve indexed \~120M+ songs from the iTunes catalog with a custom AI audio model that I built for understanding music.

My model analyzes raw music audio as input and produces embedding vectors as output.

I then store the embedding vectors for all songs into a vector database, and use semantic search to find similar music!

**Here are some examples you can try:**

khin4c,[N] Montreal-based Element AI sold for $230-million as founders saw value mostly wiped out,"According to [Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-element-ai-sold-for-230-million-as-founders-saw-value-wiped-out/) article:

**Element AI sold for $230-million as founders saw value mostly wiped out, document reveals**

Montreal startup Element AI Inc. was running out of money and options when it inked a deal last month to sell itself for US$230-milion to Silicon Valley software company ServiceNow Inc., a confidential document obtained by the Globe and Mail reveals.

Materials sent to Element AI shareholders Friday reveal that while many of its institutional shareholders will make most if not all of their money back from backing two venture financings, employees will not fare nearly as well. Many have been terminated and had their stock options cancelled.

Also losing out are co-founders Jean-François Gagné, the CEO, his wife Anne Martel, the chief administrative officer, chief science officer Nick Chapados and **Yoshua Bengio**, the University of Montreal professor known as a godfather of “deep learning,” the foundational science behind today’s AI revolution.

Between them, they owned 8.8 million common shares, whose value has been wiped out with the takeover, which goes to a shareholder vote Dec 29 with enough investor support already locked up to pass before the takeover goes to a Canadian court to approve a plan of arrangement with ServiceNow. The quartet also owns preferred shares worth less than US$300,000 combined under the terms of the deal.

The shareholder document, a management proxy circular, provides a rare look inside efforts by a highly hyped but deeply troubled startup as it struggled to secure financing at the same time as it was failing to live up to its early promises.

The circular states the US$230-million purchase price is subject to some adjustments and expenses which could bring the final price down to US$195-million.

The sale is a disappointing outcome for a company that burst onto the Canadian tech scene four years ago like few others, promising to deliver AI-powered operational improvements to a range of industries and anchor a thriving domestic AI sector. Element AI became the self-appointed representative of Canada’s AI sector, lobbying politicians and officials and landing numerous photo ops with them, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. It also secured $25-million in federal funding – $20-million of which was committed earlier this year and cancelled by the government with the ServiceNow takeover.

Element AI invested heavily in hype and and earned international renown, largely due to its association with Dr. Bengio. It raised US$102-million in venture capital in 2017 just nine months after its founding, an unheard of amount for a new Canadian company, from international backers including Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp., Tencent Holdings Ltd., Fidelity Investments, a Singaporean sovereign wealth fund and venture capital firms.

Element AI went on a hiring spree to establish what the founders called “supercredibility,” recruiting top AI talent in Canada and abroad. It opened global offices, including a British operation that did pro bono work to deliver “AI for good,” and its ranks swelled to 500 people.

But the swift hiring and attention-seeking were at odds with its success in actually building a software business. Element AI took two years to focus on product development after initially pursuing consulting gigs. It came into 2019 with a plan to bring several AI-based products to market, including a cybersecurity offering for financial institutions and a program to help port operators predict waiting times for truck drivers.

It was also quietly shopping itself around. In December 2018, the company asked financial adviser Allen & Co LLC to find a potential buyer, in addition to pursuing a private placement, the circular reveals.

But Element AI struggled to advance proofs-of-concept work to marketable products. Several client partnerships faltered in 2019 and 2020.

Element did manage to reach terms for a US$151.4-million ($200-million) venture financing in September, 2019 led by the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec and backed by the Quebec government and consulting giant McKinsey and Co. However, the circular reveals the company only received the first tranche of the financing – roughly half of the amount – at the time, and that it had to meet unspecified conditions to get the rest. A fairness opinion by Deloitte commissioned as part of the sale process estimated Element AI’s enterprises value at just US$76-million around the time of the 2019 financing, shrinking to US$45-million this year.

“However, the conditions precedent the closing of the second tranche … were not going to be met in a timely manner,” the circular reads. It states “new terms were proposed” for a round of financing that would give incoming investors ranking ahead of others and a cumulative dividend of 12 per cent on invested capital and impose “other operating and governance constraints and limitations on the company.” Management instead decided to pursue a sale, and Allen contacted prospective buyers in June.

As talks narrowed this past summer to exclusive negotiations with ServiceNow, “the company’s liquidity was diminishing as sources of capital on acceptable terms were scarce,” the circular reads. By late November, it was generating revenue at an annualized rate of just $10-million to $12-million, Deloitte said.

As part of the deal – which will see ServiceNow keep Element AI’s research scientists and patents and effectively abandon its business – the buyer has agreed to pay US$10-million to key employees and consultants including Mr. Gagne and Dr. Bengio as part of a retention plan. The Caisse and Quebec government will get US$35.45-million and US$11.8-million, respectively, roughly the amount they invested in the first tranche of the 2019 financing.",526,211,sensetime,2020-12-21 14:40:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/khin4c/n_montrealbased_element_ai_sold_for_230million_as/,0,MachineLearning

4j0u2z,In-depth Machine Learning Course w/ Python,"Hi there, my name is Harrison and I frequently do Python programming tutorials on [PythonProgramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net) and [YouTube.com/sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex). 

I do my best to produce tutorials for beginner-intermediate programmers, mainly by making sure nothing is left to abstraction and hand waving. 

The most recent series is an in-depth machine learning course, aimed at breaking down the complex ML concepts that are typically just ""done for you"" in a hand-wavy fashion with packages and modules. 

The machine learning series is aimed at just about anyone with a basic understanding of Python programming and the willingness to learn. If you're confused about something we're doing, I can either help, or point you towards a tutorial that I've done already (I have about 1,000) to help.

The main structure for the course is to:

* Do a quick overview of the theory of each machine learning algorithm we cover.
* Show an application of that algorithm using a module, like scikit-learn, along with some real world data.
* Break down the algorithm and re-write it ourselves, **without machine learning modules**, in Python.

We're not rewriting the algorithms with the intention that we're going to actually produce something superior than what's available, but rather to learn more about how the algorithms actually work, so that we understand them better. I also see a lot of people are very keen to learn about deep-learning, but the learning curve to get to that point is quite challenging, since quite a bit of deep learning requires you to have a wholistic understanding of how things are actually working, and not just a high-level understanding of how to use a module. Hopefully this can help. 

At least for me personally, I have learned a lot by breaking the algorithms down, so I thought I would share that in my tutorials.

All tutorials are posted on **[PythonProgramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/)** as well as **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v)**, so you can follow along in video, text, or both forms, and the content is all free. 

We've done linear regression and K Nearest Neighbors so far, and have quite a long way to go still. We are going to be diving into the Support Vector Machine next, then clustering, neural networks and deep learning. Once we've made our way to deep learning, we're going to be working with TensorFlow.

If all that sounds interesting to you, come hang out and learn with us! 

I tend to release a couple videos a week. If you have suggestions/requests, feel free to share.

&#x200B;

The National AI Initiative Office is established in accordance with  the recently passed National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of  2020. Demonstrating strong bipartisan support for the Administration’s  longstanding effort, the Act also codified into law and expanded many  existing AI policies and initiatives at the White House and throughout  the Federal Government:

* The [American AI Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/American-AI-Initiative-One-Year-Annual-Report.pdf), which was established via [Executive Order 13859](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-maintaining-american-leadership-artificial-intelligence/),  identified five key lines of effort that are now codified into law.  These efforts include increasing AI research investment, unleashing  Federal AI computing and data resources, setting AI technical standards,  building America’s AI workforce, and engaging with our international  allies.
* The [Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Charter-Select-Committee-on-AI-Jan-2021-posted.pdf),  launched by the White House in 2018 to coordinate Federal AI efforts,  is being expanded and made permanent, and will serve as the senior  interagency body referenced in the Act that is responsible for  overseeing the National AI Initiative.
* The [National AI Research Institutes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/trump-administration-investing-1-billion-research-institutes-advance-industries-future/)  announced by the White House and the National Science Foundation in  2020 were codified into law. These collaborative research and education  institutes will focus on a range of AI R&D areas, such as machine  learning, synthetic manufacturing, precision agriculture, and extreme  weather prediction.
* Regular updates to the national [AI R&D strategic plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/National-AI-Research-and-Development-Strategic-Plan-2019-Update-June-2019.pdf), which were initiated by the White House in 2019, are codified into law.

11kzkla,[R] Analysis of 200+ ML competitions in 2022,"I run mlcontests.com, a website that aggregates ML competitions across Kaggle and other platforms.

I've just finished a detailed analysis of **200+ competitions** in 2022, and what winners did (we found winning solutions for 67 competitions).

Some highlights:

* **Kaggle still dominant** with the most prize money, most competitions, and most entries per competition...
* ... but there are **10+ other platforms** with interesting competitions and decent prize money, and dozens of single-competition sites
* **Almost all competition winners used Python**, 1 used C++, 1 used R, 1 used Java
* **96% (!) of Deep Learning solutions used PyTorch** (up from 77% last year)
* **All winning NLP solutions we found used Transformers**
* **Most computer vision solutions used CNNs**, though some used Transformer-based models
* **Tabular data competitions were mostly won by GBDTs** (gradient-boosted decision trees; mostly LightGBM), though ensembles with PyTorch are common
* **Some winners spent hundreds of dollars on cloud compute** for a single training run, **others managed to win just using Colab**'s free tier
* Winners have largely converged on a common toolkit - PyData stack for the basics, PyTorch for deep learning, LightGBM/XGBoost/CatBoost for GBDTs, Optuna for hyperparam optimisation.
* Half of competition winners are first-time winners; a third have won multiple comps before; half are solo winners. Some *serial winners* won 2-3 competitions just in 2022!

phvgzb,[R] How machine learning will revolutionise physics simulations in games?,"*“The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these  laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble”,* said the renowned British quantum physicist Paul Dirac in 1929 \[1\]. Dirac implied that all physical phenomena can be simulated down to the quantum, from protein folding to material failures and climate change. The only problem is that the governing equations are too complex to be solved at realistic time-scales.

Does this mean that we can never achieve real-time physics simulations?  Well, physicists have a knack for developing models, methods, and approximations to achieve the desired results in shorter  timescales. With all the advancements in research, software, and  hardware technology, real-time simulation has only been made possible at the classical limit which is most evident in video game physics.

Simulating physical phenomena such as collisions, deformations, fracture, and fluid flow are computationally intensive, yet models have been developed that simulate such phenomena in real-time within games. Of course there have been a lot of simplifications and optimizations of different algorithms to make it happen. The fastest method is rigid body physics. This is what most games are based on where objects can collide and rebound without deforming. Objects are represented by  convex collision boxes which surround the object, and when two objects collide, the collision is detected in real-time and appropriate forces are applied to simulate the impact. There are no deformations or fractures  in this representation. The video game ‘Teardown’ is potentially the  pinnacle of rigid body physics.

[ Teardown, a fully interactive voxel-based game, uses rigid-body physics solvers to simulate destruction.](https://i.redd.it/cla44l1sqil71.gif)

Although rigid body physics is good for simulating non-deformable collisions, it is not suitable for  deformable materials such as hair and clothes which games heavily rely on. This is where soft-body dynamics comes in. Below, you can see four methods for simulating deformable objects in the order of complexity:

# Spring-Mass Model

The  name is totally self-explanatory. Objects are represented by a system of point masses that are connected to each other via springs. You can think of it as a network of one-dimensional Hooke’s law in a 3D setup. The main drawbacks of this model is that it requires a lot of manual work in setting up the mass-spring network, and there isn’t a rigorous relationship between material properties and model parameters. Nonetheless, the model has been implemented exceptionally well in   ‘BeamNG.Drive’, a real-time vehicle simulator that is based on spring-mass model to simulate vehicle deformations.

[ BeamNG.Drive uses spring-mass models to simulate car crash deformations.](https://i.redd.it/6chnk51pqil71.gif)

# Position-based Dynamics (PBD)

The methods of simulating kinematics are generally based on force-based models where the particle accelerations are calculated from Newton’s  second law, and then integrated to obtain the velocities and positions at every time step. In position-based dynamics, the positions are computed directly through solving a quasi-static problem involving a set of equations that include constraints. PBD is less accurate but faster than a forced-based approach, making it ideal for applications in games, animation films, and visual effects. The movement of hair and clothes in games are generally simulated through this model. PBD is not limited to deformable solids, but can also be used to simulate rigid body systems and fluids. Here is an excellent survey on PBD methods \[2\].

# Finite-Element Method (FEM)

The finite element method of computing deformations in materials is based on numerically solving the stress-strain equations based on the elastic field theory. It is essentially solving the 3D Hookes law in 3D. The material is divided into finite elements, usually tetrahedra, and the  stress and strain on vertices are calculated at every time step through  solving a linear matrix equation. FEM is a mesh-based approach to simulating soft-body dynamics. It is very accurate and the model parameters are directly related to material properties such as Young’s modulus and Poisson ratio. FEM simulations for engineering applications are generally not real-time, but recently AMD, one of the largest   semiconductor companies, released its multi-threaded FEM library for games called FEMFX that simulated material deformations in real-time.

# Material Point Method (MPM)

MPM is a highly accurate mesh-free method which is much more suitable than mesh-based methods for simulating large deformations, fractures, multi-material systems and viscoelastic fluids because of its improved efficiency and resolution. MPM is currently the state-of-the-art of mesh-free hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian methods, developed as a generalization to older methods such as Particle in Cell (PIC) and Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP). MPM simulations are not real-time, and state-of-the art simulations take about half a minute per frame for systems involving about a million points. Here is a comprehensive course notes on MPM \[3\].

# Machine Learning and Physics Simulations

So what does Machine Learning have to do with all this? Well you have probably already noticed that there is always a trade-off between computation speed and accuracy/resolution. With physics solvers having been optimized enormously over the past few decades, there is little room left for step-change improvements. 

Here is where Machine Learning comes in. Recent research by Oxford  \[5\],  Ubisoft La Forge \[6\], DeepMind \[7,8\], and ETH Zurich \[9\] demonstrate  that a deep neural network can learn physics interactions  and emulate them multiple orders of magnitude faster. This is done through generating millions of simulation data, feeding them through the neural network for training, and using the trained model to emulate  what a  physics solver would do. Although the offline process would take a  lot of time in generating data and training the model, the trained neural network model is much faster at simulating the physics. For instance, the researchers at Oxford \[5\] developed a method called Deep Emulator Network Search (DENSE) that accelerates simulations up to 2 billion times, and they demonstrated this in 10 scientific case studies including astrophysics, climate, fusion, and high energy physics.

In the gaming sector, Ubisoft La Forge’s team used a simple feed-forward network that trains on the vertex positions of 3D mesh objects at three subsequent time frames and learns to predict the next  frame \[6\]. The model essentially compares the predictions with the known positions from the simulated datasets, and back-propagates to adjust  the model parameters to minimize the error in making predictions. The team used Maya’s nCloth physics solver to generate simulation data which is an advanced spring-mass model optimized for cloths. They also implemented a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to only train on the most important bases. The results were astounding. The neural network could emulate the physics up to 5000 times faster than the physics solver.

[ Fast data-driven physics simulations of cloths and squishy materials \[6\].](https://preview.redd.it/uutv7phksil71.png?width=1564&format=png&auto=webp&s=adc0d443c0b4e623188d4288697730525a36fc10)

Watch video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjEvV86byxg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjEvV86byxg)

Another recent work by Peter Battaglia’s team at DeepMind achieved astonishing results with graph networks \[7\]. Unlike traditional neural networks where each layer of nodes is connected to every node in the next layer, a graph neural network has a graph-like structure. With this  model, they managed to simulate a wide range of materials including  sand, water, goop, and rigid solids. Instead of predicting the positions of particles, the model predicts the accelerations, and the velocities and  positions are computed using an Euler integration. The simulation  data  were generated using a range of physics solvers including PBD, SPH (smoothed-particle hydrodynamics) and MPM. The model was not optimized for speed and therefore it was not significantly faster than the physics solvers, but certainly it demonstrated what can be made possible when Machine Learning meets physics.

This field is still in its infancy, but certainly we will be observing new ML-based technologies that enhance physics simulations. There are just so many models for simulating any physical phenomena at all scales and complexities, ranging from quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics  to  microstructure and classical physics, and the potential opportunities to create value from the duo of Machine learning and Physics are immense.

agiatj,[D] Google AI refuses to share dataset fields for a dataset paper (ACL'18) and associated challenge (at CVPR'19),"I'd like to bring to the attention of the r/MachineLearning community that I came across Google's Conceptual Captions contest and dataset paper titled [Conceptual Captions: A Cleaned, Hypernymed, Image Alt-text Dataset For Automatic Image Captioning](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1238).  


Repo Link: [https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions)

&#x200B;

The dataset has roughly 3.3M images (all of them are hosted and some links are now broken).  Also:

* Refusal to share pretrained models making benchmarking and reporting numbers super hard (not everyone has 1k TPUs at their helm):  [https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions/issues/3](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions/issues/3)
* Refusal to share Alt-text associated with each image (the title of the paper quite ironically is \`Conceptual Captions: A Cleaned, Hypernymed, Image Alt-text Dataset For Automatic Image Captioning\`): [https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions/issues/6](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions/issues/6)
* Refusal to share images / mirror links (while I agree the there are legal issues, but with several hundred images missing from the dataset it becomes superhard for the community to compare models): [https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions/issues/1](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions/issues/1)

It is extremely painful to see that after so many elaborate attempts made by Google (Colab, Dataset search engine etc, for which I am greatly thankful!) to promote open research, such instances happen.

I hope that people from the community realize that a dataset paper is a big responsibility to carry on one's shoulder and if there are legal issues which hinder sharing of datasets - publishing a paper on a private data is fine (with some fields not made public like Alt-text), but hosting a challenge on the same w/o releasing models or entire dataset doesn't seem supercool to me.",508,103,binary_zeitgeist,2019-01-16 06:16:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/agiatj/d_google_ai_refuses_to_share_dataset_fields_for_a/,0,MachineLearning

1bab774,"[N] Matrix multiplication breakthrough could lead to faster, more efficient AI models","""Computer scientists have discovered a new way to multiply large matrices  faster than ever before by eliminating a previously unknown  inefficiency, reports [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-breakthrough-brings-matrix-multiplication-closer-to-ideal-20240307/). This could eventually accelerate AI models like [ChatGPT](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/),  which rely heavily on matrix multiplication to function. The findings,  presented in two recent papers, have led to what is reported to be the  biggest improvement in matrix multiplication efficiency in over a  decade. ... Graphics processing units (GPUs) excel in handling matrix  multiplication tasks because of their ability to process many  calculations at once. They break down large matrix problems into smaller  segments and solve them concurrently using an algorithm. Perfecting [that algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication_algorithm)  has been the key to breakthroughs in matrix multiplication efficiency  over the past century—even before computers entered the picture. In  October 2022, we covered [a new technique](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/deepmind-breaks-50-year-math-record-using-ai-new-record-falls-a-week-later/)  discovered by a Google DeepMind AI model called AlphaTensor, focusing  on practical algorithmic improvements for specific matrix sizes, such as  4x4 matrices.

By contrast, the [new research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10173),  conducted by Ran Duan and Renfei Zhou of Tsinghua University, Hongxun  Wu of the University of California, Berkeley, and by Virginia  Vassilevska Williams, Yinzhan Xu, and Zixuan Xu of the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology ([in a second paper](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611977912.134)),  seeks theoretical enhancements by aiming to lower the complexity  exponent, ω, for a broad efficiency gain across all sizes of matrices.  Instead of finding immediate, practical solutions like AlphaTensor, the  new technique addresses foundational improvements that could transform  the efficiency of matrix multiplication on a more general scale. 

... The traditional method for multiplying two n-by-n matrices requires n³  separate multiplications. However, the new technique, which improves  upon the ""[laser method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05846)"" introduced by [Volker Strassen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volker_Strassen)  in 1986, has reduced the upper bound of the exponent (denoted as the  aforementioned ω), bringing it closer to the ideal value of 2, which  represents the theoretical minimum number of operations needed.""

snmtzn,[R] PhD thesis: On Neural Differential Equations!,"[arXiv link here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02435)

TL;DR: I've written a ""textbook"" for neural differential equations (NDEs). Includes ordinary/stochastic/controlled/rough diffeqs, for learning physics, time series, generative problems etc. [+ Unpublished material on generalised adjoint methods, symbolic regression, universal approximation, ...]

Hello everyone! I've been posting on this subreddit for a while now, mostly about either tech stacks (JAX vs PyTorch etc.) -- or about ""neural differential equations"", and more generally the places where physics meets machine learning.

If you're interested, then I wanted to share that my doctoral thesis is now available online! Rather than the usual staple-papers-together approach, I decided to go a little further and write a 231-page kind-of-a-textbook.

[If you're curious how this is possible: most (but not all) of the work on NDEs has been on ordinary diffeqs, so that's equivalent to the ""background""/""context"" part of a thesis. Then a lot of the stuff on controlled, stochastic, rough diffeqs is the ""I did this bit"" part of the thesis.]

This includes material on:

- neural ordinary diffeqs: e.g. for learning physical systems, as continuous-time limits of discrete architectures, includes theoretical results on expressibility;
- neural controlled diffeqs: e.g. for modelling functions of time series, handling irregularity;
- neural stochastic diffeqs: e.g. for sampling from complicated high-dimensional stochastic dynamics;
- numerical methods: e.g. the new class of reversible differential equation solvers, or the problem of Brownian reconstruction.

And also includes a bunch of previously-unpublished material -- mostly stuff that was ""half a paper"" in size so I never found a place to put it. Including:

- Neural ODEs can be universal approximators even if their vector fields aren't.
- A general approach to backpropagating through ordinary/stochastic/whatever differential equations, via rough path theory. (Special cases of this -- e.g. Pontryagin's Maximum Principle -- have been floating around for decades.) Also includes some readable meaningful special cases if you're not familiar with rough path theory ;)
- Some new symbolic regression techniques for dynamical systems (joint work with Miles Cranmer) by combining neural differential equations with genetic algorithms (regularised evolution).
- What make effective choices of vector field for neural differential equations; effective choices of interpolations for neural CDEs; other practical stuff like this.

If you've made it this far down the post, then [here's a sneak preview](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax) of the brand-new accompanying software library, of differential equation solvers in JAX. More about that when I announce it officially next week ;)

To wrap this up! My hope is that this can serve as a reference for the current state-of-the-art in the field of neural differential equations. [So here's the arXiv link again](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02435), and let me know what you think. And finally for various musings, marginalia, extra references, and open problems, you might like the ""comments"" section at the end of each chapter.

rd3oby,[P] Yuno: An AI search engine that recommends anime given a specific description.,"**Yuno In Action**

&#x200B;

[Yuno](https://reddit.com/link/rd3oby/video/usbwwme58o481/player)

This is the search engine that I have  been working on past 6 months. Working on it for quite some time now, I  am confident that the search engine is now usable.

source code: [**Yuno**](https://github.com/IAmPara0x/yuno)

Try Yuno on (both notebooks has UI):

1. [**kaggle notebook**](https://www.kaggle.com/iamparadox/yunoo/)  (recommended notebook)
2. [**colab notebook**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WAewYgHDmDEWhPBBOvGgyLTiOaasVyOz?usp=sharing)

My Research on [**Yuno**](https://medium.com/@confusedstudent13/yuno-context-based-search-engine-for-anime-39f5cb86f845)**.**

# What does it do?

Basically  you can type what kind of anime you are looking for and then Yuno will analyze and compare more **0.5 Million** reviews and other anime information  that are in it's index and then it will return those animes that might  contain qualities that you are looking. [r/Animesuggest](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/) is the inspiration for this search engine, where people essentially does the same thing.

# How does it do?

This is my favourite part, the idea is pretty simple it goes like this.

Let says that, I am looking for *an romance anime with tsundere female MC.*

**If  I read every review of an anime that exists on the Internet, then I  will be able to determine if this anime has the qualities that I am  looking for or n**ot.

or framing differently,

**The  more reviews I read about an anime, the more likely I am to decide  whether this particular anime has some of the qualities that I am  looking for.**

&#x200B;

Consider a section of a review from anime ***Oregairu:***

>Yahari Ore isn’t the first anime to tackle the anti-social protagonist,  but it certainly captures it perfectly with its characters and deadpan  writing . It’s charming, funny and yet bluntly realistic . You may go  into this expecting a typical rom-com but will instead come out of it  lashed by the harsh views of our characters .

Just By reading this much of review, we can conclude that this anime has:

1. anti-social protagonist
2. realistic romance and comedy

If we will read more reviews about this anime we can find more qualities about it.

If this is the case, then reviews must contain enough information about that particular anime to satisfy to query like mentioned above. Therefore all  I have to do is create a method that reads and analyzes different anime  reviews.

# But, How can I train a model to understand anime reviews without any kind of labelled dataset?

This  question took me some time so solve, after banging my head against the wall for quite sometime I managed to do it and it goes like this.

**Let** ***x*** **and** ***y*** **be two different anime such that they don’t share any genres among them, then the sufficiently large reviews of anime** ***x*** **and** ***y*** **will have totally different content.**

This idea is inverse to the idea of web link analysis which says,

**Hyperlinks in web documents indicate content relativity,relatedness and connectivity among the linked article.**

**That's pretty much it idea, how well does it works?**

&#x200B;

[Fig1: 10K reviews plotted from 1280D to 2D using TSNE](https://preview.redd.it/d3hzr8gf8o481.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b8596f591326857de8ceee8165ab9eebae64d83)

&#x200B;

[Fig2: Reviews of re:zero and re:zero sequel](https://preview.redd.it/d24hte0j8o481.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=0216141c99b459c72ac332f0b097c996b112bfc8)

As, you will able to see in **Fig1** that there are several clusters of different reviews, and **Fig2** is a zoomed-in version of **Fig1,** here the reviews of re:zero and it's sequel are very close to each other.But, *In our definition we never mentioned that an anime and it's sequel should close to each other.*  And this is not the only case, every anime and it's sequel are very  close each other (if you want to play and check whether this is the case  or not you can do so in this interactive [kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/iamparadox/anime-search-visualization) which contains more than 100k reviews).

&#x200B;

Since,  this method doesn't use any kind of handcrafted labelled training data  this method easily be extended to different many domains like: [r/booksuggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/), [r/MovieSuggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/) . which i think is pretty cool.

&#x200B;

# Context Indexer

This is my favourite indexer coz it will solve a very crucial problem that is mentioned bellow.

Consider a query like: *romance anime with medieval setting and with revenge plot.*

Finding such a review about such anime is difficult because not all review talks about same thing of about that particular anime .

For eg:  consider a anime like [Yona of the Dawn](https://anilist.co/anime/20770/Akatsuki-no-Yona)

This anime has:

1. great character development
2. medieval theme
3. romance theme
4. revenge plot

Not all reviews of this anime will mention about all of the four things mention, some review will talk about romance theme or revenge plot. This means that we need to somehow ""remember"" all the reviews before deciding whether this anime contains what we are looking for or not.

I have talked about it in the great detail in the mention article above if you are interested.

&#x200B;

**Note:**  
  please avoid doing these two things otherwise search results will be very bad.

1. Don't make spelling mistakes in the query (coz there is no auto word correction)
2. Don't type nouns in the query like anime names or character names, just properties you are looking for.  
**eg**: don't type: anime like attack on titans

type: action anime with great plot and character development.

  
This is because Yuno hadn't ""watched"" any anime. It just reads reviews that's why it doesn't know what attack on titans is.   


&#x200B;

If  you have any questions regarding Yuno, please let me know I will be  more than happy to help you. Here's my discord ID (I Am ParadØx#8587).

Thank You.

k77sxz,[D] Timnit Gebru and Google Megathread,"First off, why a megathread? Since the first thread went up 1 day ago, we've had 4 different threads on this topic, all with large amounts of upvotes and hundreds of comments. Considering that a large part of the community likely would like to avoid politics/drama altogether, the continued proliferation of threads is not ideal. We don't expect that this situation will die down anytime soon, so to consolidate discussion and prevent it from taking over the sub, we decided to establish a megathread.

Second, why didn't we do it sooner, or simply delete the new threads? The initial thread had very little information to go off of, and we eventually locked it as it became too much to moderate.  Subsequent threads provided new information, and (slightly) better discussion.

Third, several commenters have asked why we allow drama on the subreddit in the first place. Well, we'd prefer if drama never showed up. Moderating these threads is a massive time sink and quite draining. However, it's clear that a substantial portion of the ML community would like to discuss this topic. Considering that r/machinelearning is one of the only communities capable of such a discussion, we are unwilling to ban this topic from the subreddit.

Overall, making a comprehensive megathread seems like the best option available, both to limit drama from derailing the sub, as well as to allow informed discussion.

We will be closing new threads on this issue, locking the previous threads, and updating this post with new information/sources as they  arise. If there any sources you feel should be added to this megathread, comment below or send a message to the mods.

Hi Reddit! I built a 3-GPU deep learning workstation similar to Lambda's 4-GPU ( RTX 2080 TI ) rig for half the price. In the hopes of helping other researchers, I'm sharing a time-lapse of the build, the parts list, the receipt, and benchmarking versus Google Compute Engine (GCE) on ImageNet. You save $1200 (the cost of an EVGA RTX 2080 ti GPU) per ImageNet training to use your own build instead of GCE. The training time is reduced by over half. In the post, I include 3 GPUs, but the build (increase PSU wattage) will support a 4th RTX 2080 TI GPU for $1200 more ($7400 total). Happy building!

e3buo3,[D] Five major deep learning papers by Geoff Hinton did not cite similar earlier work by Jurgen Schmidhuber,"still milking Jurgen's very dense [inaugural tweet](https://twitter.com/SchmidhuberAI) about their [annus mirabilis 1990-1991](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html) with Sepp Hochreiter and others, 2 of its 21 sections already made for nice reddit threads, section 5 [Jurgen really had GANs in 1990](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/djju8a/d_jurgen_schmidhuber_really_had_gans_in_1990/) and section 19 [DanNet, the CUDA CNN of Dan Ciresan in Jurgen's team, won 4 image recognition challenges prior to AlexNet](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/dwnuwh/d_dannet_the_cuda_cnn_of_dan_ciresan_in_jurgen/), but these are not the juiciest parts of the blog post

instead look at sections 1 2 8 9 10 where Jurgen mentions work they did long before Geoff, who did not cite, as confirmed by studying the references, at first glance it's not obvious, it's hidden, one has to work backwards from the references

[section 1, First Very Deep NNs, Based on Unsupervised Pre-Training (1991)](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%201), Jurgen ""facilitated supervised learning in deep RNNs by unsupervised pre-training of a hierarchical stack of RNNs"" and soon was able to ""solve previously unsolvable Very Deep Learning tasks of depth > 1000,"" he mentions reference [UN4] which is actually Geoff's later similar work:

> More than a decade after this work [UN1], a similar method for more limited feedforward NNs (FNNs) was published, facilitating supervised learning by unsupervised pre-training of stacks of FNNs called Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) [UN4]. The 2006 justification was essentially the one I used in the early 1990s for my RNN stack: each higher level tries to reduce the description length (or negative log probability) of the data representation in the level below. 

back then unsupervised pre-training was a big deal, today it's not so important any more, see [section 19, From Unsupervised Pre-Training to Pure Supervised Learning (1991-95 and 2006-11)](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019) 

[section 2, Compressing / Distilling one Neural Net into Another (1991)](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%202), Jurgen also trained ""a student NN to imitate the behavior of the teacher NN,"" briefly referring to Geoff's much later similar work [DIST2]:

> I called this ""collapsing"" or ""compressing"" the behavior of one net into another. Today, this is widely used, and also called ""distilling"" [DIST2] or ""cloning"" the behavior of a teacher net into a student net. 

[section 9, Learning Sequential Attention with NNs (1990)](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%209), Jurgen ""had both of the now common types of neural sequential attention: end-to-end-differentiable ""soft"" attention (in latent space) through multiplicative units within NNs [FAST2](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.55.1885&rep=rep1&type=pdf), and ""hard"" attention (in observation space) in the context of Reinforcement Learning (RL) [ATT0](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/FKI-128-90ocr.pdf) [ATT1],"" the blog has a statement about Geoff's later similar work [ATT3](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4089-learning-to-combine-foveal-glimpses-with-a-third-order-boltzmann-machine.pdf) which I find both funny and sad: 

> My overview paper for CMSS 1990 [ATT2] summarised in Section 5 our early work on attention, to my knowledge the first implemented neural system for combining glimpses that jointly trains a recognition & prediction component with an attentional component (the fixation controller). Two decades later, the reviewer of my 1990 paper wrote about his own work as second author of a related paper [ATT3]: ""To our knowledge, this is the first implemented system for combining glimpses that jointly trains a recognition component ... with an attentional component (the fixation controller)."" 

similar in [section 10, Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (1990)](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2010), Jurgen introduced HRL ""with end-to-end differentiable NN-based subgoal generators [HRL0](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/FKI-129-90ocr.pdf), also with recurrent NNs that learn to generate sequences of subgoals [HRL1] [HRL2],"" referring to Geoff's later work [HRL3](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/714-feudal-reinforcement-learning.pdf):  

> Soon afterwards, others also started publishing on HRL. For example, the reviewer of our reference [ATT2] (which summarised in Section 6 our early work on HRL) was last author of ref [HRL3]

[section 8, End-To-End-Differentiable Fast Weights: NNs Learn to Program NNs (1991)](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%208), Jurgen published a network ""that learns by gradient descent to quickly manipulate the fast weight storage"" of another network, and ""active control of fast weights through 2D tensors or outer product updates [FAST2](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.55.1885&rep=rep1&type=pdf),"" dryly referring to [FAST4a](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6057-using-fast-weights-to-attend-to-the-recent-past.pdf) which happens to be Geoff's later similar paper: 

> A quarter century later, others followed this approach [FAST4a]

it's really true, Geoff did not cite Jurgen in any of these similar papers, and what's kinda crazy, he was editor of Jurgen's 1990 paper [ATT2](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/hinton-rev.pdf) summarising both attention learning and hierarchical RL, then later he published closely related work, sections 9, 10, but he did not cite 

Jurgen also [famously complained](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-conspiracy.html) that Geoff's deep learning survey in Nature neither mentions the inventors of backpropagation (1960-1970) nor ""the father of deep learning, Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko, who published the first general, working learning algorithms for deep networks"" in 1965 

apart from the early pioneers in the 60s and 70s, like Ivaknenko and Fukushima, most of the big deep learning concepts stem from Jurgen's team with Sepp and Alex and Dan and others: unsupervised pre-training of deep networks, artificial curiosity and GANs, vanishing gradients, LSTM for language processing and speech and everything, distilling networks, attention learning, CUDA CNNs that win vision contests, deep nets with 100+ layers, metalearning, plus theoretical work on optimal AGI and Godel Machine",497,184,siddarth2947,2019-11-29 08:04:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/e3buo3/d_five_major_deep_learning_papers_by_geoff_hinton/,0,MachineLearning

1bleu7d,[D] Feeling burnt out after doing machine learning interviews,"I have been interviewing for Machine Learning Engineer and related positions for the last 2 months from big tech companies to small startups. There are so many different flavors of interviews and it seems all over the place. Even after interviewing for 10 different companies and more than 30 interviews later, I have had no success. I have either been ghosted or rejected from all of them.

Some of the kinds of interviews I have had are:

1. Leetcode-style coding questions.
2. Implement machine learning algorithms like SVM or some component of algorithms like backpropagation or convolution from scratch.
3. Programming language-related questions in depth like about Python GIL or about C++ pointers.
4. OOP-related theoretical and implementation questions.
5. Typical SWE style system design interviews like design Instagram
6. Machine learning system design interviews like a design a recommendation system.
7. Machine learning theoretical questions like what is hinge loss or explain logistic regression or when could KL divergence be used.
8. Deep learning theoretical questions like what's the difference between SGD and Adam, what is quantization in neural networks, how can you speed up inference of a deep learning model.
9. Computer Vision theoretical questions like what's the difference between YOLO and FasterRCNN, what loss function could be used for image segmentation, or explain epipolar geometry.
10. Natural Language Processing theoretical questions like how transformers are better than RNNs, what is bidirectional in BERT or what is the difference between stemming and lemmatization.
11. Previous work, previous research paper, previous project-related questions.
12. Take-home assignments are also all over the place from building a time series-based model to deploying a classification model as an endpoint to problems related to what their company is facing.
13. Tools-related questions like Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, etc.
14. Behavioral round interviews
15. Math, statistics, and probability-based interviews like questions on Bayes theorem or on Bernoulli distribution or what is the rank of a matrix or differentiate something.

I am sure there are other flavors of interviews that I am missing as well. I have a not-so-good memory so maybe I tend to forget the stuff I study and hence find these interviews difficult. I am wondering how people even prepare for these interviews.",487,100,Tiny-Masterpiece-412,2024-03-23 00:26:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1bleu7d/d_feeling_burnt_out_after_doing_machine_learning/,0,MachineLearning
s4c6ob,[P] Built a dog poop detector for my backyard,"Over winter break I started poking around online for ways to track dog poop in my backyard. I don't like having to walk around and hope I picked up all of it. Where I live it snows a lot, and poops get lost in the snow come new snowfall. I found some cool concept gadgets that people have made, but nothing that worked with just a security cam. So I built this poop detector and made a video about it. When some code I wrote detects my dog pooping it will remember the location and draw a circle where my dog pooped on a picture of my backyard.

So over the course of a couple of months I have a bunch of circle on a picture of my backyard, where all my dog's poops are. So this coming spring I will know where to look!

My opinion is that GPT-4 Vision/Image processing is out of science fiction. I fed chatgpt an image of a complex sql data base schema, and it converted it to code, then optimized the schema. It understood the arrows pointing between table boxes on the image as relations, and even understand many to one/many to many. 

I took a picture of random writing on a page, and it did OCR better than has ever been possible. I was able to ask questions that required OCR and a geometrical understanding of the page layout. 

Where is the hype on here? This is an astounding human breakthrough. I cannot believe how much ML is now obsolete as a result.

*----*

This week’s US rollout of the first COVID-19 vaccine is a major milestone, a true triumph for scientists, and a massive relief for the rest of us. But it’s also an excuse to revisit my least favorite paper published this year.

That paper, “[Estimating the deep replicability of scientific findings using human and artificial intelligence](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/uzzi/htm/papers/Replicability-PNAS-2020.pdf),” was written by a team of researchers at Northwestern led by Brian Uzzi. It was published in PNAS on May 4, and its publication was accompanied by a glowing press release (“[AI speeds up search for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2020/05/ai-tool-speeds-up-search-for-covid-19-treatments-and-vaccines/?fj=1)”) and received credulous coverage in outlets like [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2020/05/04/artificial-intelligence-reproducibility-crisis-kellogg/) and [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/northwestern-university-team-develops-tool-to-rate-covid-19-research-11589275800).

One of my primary professional interests is using data analysis to systematically identify good science, so I was eager to dig into the paper. Unfortunately, I found that the paper is flawed and doesn’t support the Covid-related story that the authors and Northwestern shared with the media. My initial skepticism has proved out; vaccines are now being distributed with (as far as I can tell) no help whatsoever from this particular bit of AI. Closer analysis will show that the paper isn’t convincing, that it had nothing to do with Covid, and that the author was reckless in how he promoted it.

**Problem #1: The machine learning in the academic paper is flawed**

The core of the paper is a machine learning model built by the authors that predicts whether or not a paper will replicate. To be technical about it, the model is trained on a dataset of 96 social science papers, 59 of which (61.4%) failed to replicate. The model takes the full text of the paper as an input, uses word embeddings and TF-IDF to convert each text to a 400-dimensional vector, and then feeds those vectors into an ensemble logistic regression/random forest model. The cross-validated results show an average accuracy of 0.69 across runs compared to the baseline accuracy of 0.614. These are all standard techniques, but skilled machine learning practitioners are already raising their eyebrows about three points:

* **The authors don’t have enough data to build a reliable model**. The authors have used just 96 examples to build a model with 400 input variables. As mentioned above, the model has two components: a logistic regressor and a random forest. A conventional rule of thumb is that logistic regression requires a minimum of 10 examples per variable, which would suggest that the authors need 40x more data. “Underdetermined” doesn’t even begin to describe the situation.The data needs of random forests are harder to characterize. While geneticists [routinely use random forests](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3154091/) in settings with more variables than examples, their use case is typically more focused on determining variable importance than actually making predictions. And indeed, [some research suggests](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25532820/) that random forests need more than 200 examples per variable, or almost 1000x more data than the authors have.**The bottom line is that you can’t build a reliable machine learning model on just 96 papers.**
* **The model structure is too complicated**. Model structure is the garden of forking paths for machine learning. Adjustments to a model can improve its performance on available data while reducing performance on unseen data. (And no, cross-validation alone doesn’t fix this!) The model structure the authors describe is reasonable enough, but it also includes some clearly arbitrary choices like using both logistic regression and random forests (rather than just picking one) or aggregating word vectors using both simple averaging and TF-IDF (again rather than just picking one.) With just 96 examples in the dataset, each version of model that the authors tried had a real chance to show a cross-validation accuracy that looked like success despite arising from chance. In context, **trying multiple model architectures is the the equivalent of performing subgroup analyses.**
* **The effect size is too small.** Increasing accuracy from the baseline of 0.614 to 0.69 is too small an effect to achieve statistical significance particularly in light of the small sample size. The large number of degrees of freedom in model design. The paper’s statistical analyses generate pleasing p-values (*p<0.001*) demonstrating that the model is effective *on this particular set of papers.* But what we’re actually interested in is whether the model outperforms the baseline on unseen data (i.e. whether it has better generalization error.) Performing [inference about generalization error](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024068626366) is a [challenging task](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6790639) (and there isn’t a single agreed upon methodology). But as a sanity check, consider the t-test we would use to e.g. determine if one diagnostic test were more accurate than another when given to patients. The cynical baseline (predicting that nothing ever replicates) gives an accuracy of 0.614 on these 96 papers. The authors’ model achieves an accuracy of 0.69 on those same papers. That gives a one-tailed p-value of 0.134 — a delightful value for a paper that is itself about replicability. And this point isn't just pedantry; I'm genuinely unsure if the model will actually outperform the cynical baseline on unseen data. I don't know what the base rate for replication is in the test sets. I did track down the replication status for one set (Row 2 in the paper) and saw  7 out of the 8 results in that set failed to replicate, so our cynical baseline achieves an accuracy of 0.875 — outperforming the “AI” model significantly on this admittedly small set.

Let me be very clear: These are very fundamental problems. After reviewing the paper, I’m not confident that their machine learning model adds any value at all. It reflects poorly on PNAS that this paper made it through peer review. Unfortunately, general scientific journals - no matter how prestigious - don’t seem equipped to effectively review papers involving machine learning; Nature’s infamous paper on predicting earthquakes with deep learning was [widely criticized](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/c4ylga/d_misuse_of_deep_learning_in_nature_journals/) in the machine learning community.

**Problem #2: The paper has nothing to do with Covid**

Let’s set aside every issue I’ve raised to this point and accept that the authors really can identify social science papers that are less likely to replicate. That still doesn’t make it relevant to Covid.

Their entire system is premised on picking up subtle linguistic markers that supposedly indicate when a researcher (perhaps subconsciously) believes she’s performing sub-par science. Uzzi compares the approach to reading body language.

But there’s no reason to believe that the linguistic “body language” of psychologists tells us anything about the body language of Covid-19 researchers. Psychology and virology are very different fields with different conventions even in normal times. The pandemic itself has undoubtedly impacted word choices, as papers written under extreme time pressure by researchers from around the world get shared to pre-print servers rather than being polished and published in journals. At a minimum, the model would have to be significantly adjusted to be applied to Covid research.

**Problem #3: Northwestern and Brian Uzzi crossed the line promoting this paper**

Self-promotion is a natural and even important part of science; good research doesn’t always get the attention is deserves. And certainly the decade-long AI boom has been driven forward by rosy projections about what AI can accomplish. But the paper’s lead author, Brian Uzzi, went too far in his efforts to promote it.

The paper was published just two months into the pandemic at a time when the trauma felt more acute than chronic. The uncertainty and fear fueled a desperation for anything that might end the ordeal. In that environment, putting out a press release entitled “AI speeds up search for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines” takes on a moral dimension.

The scientists and trial participants who brought us a vaccine in record time are heroes. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal coverage of this paper now has a correction appended:

>Northwestern University researchers will make an artificial-intelligence tool designed to rate the promise of scientific papers on Covid-19 vaccines and treatments available when testing is completed. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the tool would be available later this year.

Indeed.

dp389c,[D] ICCV 19 - The state of (some) ethically questionable papers,"Hello everyone,

I was wondering if anyone else have similar feelings with regards to a number of accepted papers coming from Chinese universities/authors presented in ICCV. Thus far in the conference, I came across quite a lot of papers with questionable motives which made me question the ethical consequences.

These papers are, for the most part, concerned with various forms of person identification (i.e., typical big brother stuff). In fact, when you look at the accepted papers, more than 80% of any kind of identification papers have Chinese authors/affiliations.

But that's not all, some papers go to extreme lengths of person re-identification such as:

1- Occluded person re- identification (i.e., person re-identification through mask/glass)

2- Person re-identification in low-light environments

3- Cross domain person re-identification

4- Cross dataset person re-identification

5- Cross modality person re-identification

6- Unsupervised person re-identification

&#x200B;

And maybe you think person re-identification is all there is, but its not. There are also:

1- Vehicle identification, vehicle re-identification, vehicle re-identification from aerial images

2- Occluded vehicle recovery

3- Lip reading from video sequences

4- Crowd counting in scenes, crowd density prediction, and crowd counting in aerial pictures (in fact, all but one crowd counting papers are China affiliated)

&#x200B;

I wonder whether I am being overly sensitive due to recent influx of news about Uighurs in China and Hong Kong protests etc. or if these papers are basically funded by the Chinese government (or its extensions) for some big brother stuff.

What is your opinion on the research on these subjects which can be used for some ethically questionable applications getting published in top conferences?

&#x200B;

Edit: I should mention that I did not mean to offend any Chinese researchers and I am of course aware that many great inventions in recent ML/DL research that we use came from Chinese researchers. What I stated above is merely my observation while passing by the posters in the conference.

Note that this is related to the work in the *Deal or No Deal? End-to-End Learning for Negotiation Dialogues* paper. On it's own, it is interesting work.

While the article from Independent seems to be the only one that finally gives the clarification *'The company chose to shut down the chats because ""our interest was having bots who could talk to people""'*, **ALL** the articles say things that suggest that researchers went into panic mode, had to 'pull the plug' out of fear, this stuff is scary. One of the articles (don't remember which) even went on to say something like *'A week after Elon Musk suggested AI needs to be regulated and Mark Zuckerberg disagreed, Facebook had to shut down it's AI because it became too dangerous/scary'* (or something to this effect).

While I understand the hype around deep learning (a.k.a backpropaganda), etc., I think these articles are so ridiculous. I wouldn't even call this hype, but almost 'fake news'. I understand that sometimes articles should try to make the news more interesting/appealing by hyping it a bit, but this is almost detrimental, and is just promoting AI fear-mongering. 

EDIT#1: Some people on Facebook are actually believing this fear to be real, sending me links and asking me about it. :/

Instead, we have a million paper titled ***X Is All You Need*** that show some marginal effects when applying X. 

Another frequent pattern of mediocre paper titles is to describe the method instead of the results. For instance, *Reinforcement Learning with Bayesian Kernel Latent Meanfield Priors* (made up title). Such titles are already better than the X Is All You Need crap, but describes what the authors are doing instead of what the authors showed/observed.

History tends to repeat itself. But FB-Prophet's [tainted memory](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/syx41w/p_beware_of_false_fbprophets_introducing_the/) is too recent and should act as a warning not to repeat the same mistakes.

This post compares Neural-Prophet's performance with Exponential Smoothing (ETS), a half-century-old forecasting method part of every practitioner's toolkit.

Our [comparison](https://github.com/Nixtla/statsforecast/blob/main/experiments/neuralprophet/README.md) covers Tourism, M3, M4, ERCOT, and ETTm2 datasets, following the authors' recommended hyperparameter and network configuration settings. Despite Neural-Prophet's [outstanding success](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15397) over its unreliable predecessor, its errors are still 30 percent larger than ETS' while doubling its computation time.

We hope this exercise helps the community evaluation of forecasting tools. And help us avoid adopting yet another overpromising and unproven forecasting method.

cbnftu,[News] DeepMind’s StarCraft II Agent AlphaStar Will Play Anonymously on Battle.net,"[https://starcraft2.com/en-us/news/22933138](https://starcraft2.com/en-us/news/22933138)

[Link to Hacker news discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20404847)

The announcement is from the Starcraft 2 official page. AlphaStar will play as an anonymous player against some ladder players who opt in in this experiment in the European game servers.

Some highlights:

* AlphaStar can play anonymously as and against the three different races of the game: Protoss, Terran and Zerg in 1vs1 matches, in a non-disclosed future date. Their intention is that players treat AlphaStar as any other player.
* Replays will be used to publish a peer-reviewer paper.
* They restricted this version of AlphaStar to only interact with the information it gets from the game camera (I assume that this includes the minimap, and not the API from the January version?).
* They also increased the restrictions of AlphaStar actions-per-minute (APM), according to pro players advice. There is no additional info in the blog about how this restriction is taking place.

Personally, I see this as a very interesting experiment, although I'll like to know more details about the new restrictions that AlphaStar will be using, because as it was discussed here in January, such restrictions can be unfair to human players.

hbzd5o,[D] On the public advertising of NeurIPS submissions on Twitter,"The deadline for submitting papers to the NeurIPS 2020 conference was two weeks ago. Since then, almost everyday I come across long Twitter threads from ML researchers that publicly advertise their work (obviously NeurIPS submissions, from the template and date of the shared arXiv preprint). They are often quite famous researchers from Google, Facebook... with thousands of followers and therefore a high visibility on Twitter. These posts often get a lot of likes and retweets - see examples in comment.

While I am glad to discover new exciting works, I am also concerned by the impact of such practice on the review process. I know that submissions of arXiv preprints are not forbidden by NeurIPS, but this kind of very engaging public advertising brings the anonymity violation to another level.

Besides harming the double-blind review process, I am concerned by the social pressure it puts on reviewers. It is definitely harder to reject or even criticise a work that already received praise across the community through such advertising, especially when it comes from the account of a famous researcher or a famous institution.

However, in recent Twitter discussions associated to these threads, I failed to find people caring about these aspects, notably among top researchers reacting to the posts. Would you also say that this is fine (as, anyway, we cannot really assume that a review is double-blind when arXiv public preprints with authors names and affiliations are allowed)? Or do you agree that this can be a problem?",480,127,guilIaume,2020-06-19 11:54:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hbzd5o/d_on_the_public_advertising_of_neurips/,1,MachineLearning

kkgyag,[D] - How Transformers work in deep learning and NLP: an intuitive introduction,"The famous paper “**Attention is all you need**” in 2017  changed the way we were thinking about attention. With enough data,  matrix multiplications, linear layers, and layer normalization we can  perform state-of-the-art-machine-translation.

Nonetheless, 2020 is definitely the year of transformers! From  natural language now they are into computer vision tasks. 

Honestly, I had a hard time understanding its concepts. This post explains the transformer to my past self.

How did we go  from attention to self-attention? Why does the transformer work so damn  well? What are the critical components for its success?

jgwqe8,[D] A Jobless Rant - ML is a Fool's Gold,"*Aside from the clickbait title, I am earnestly looking for some advice and discussion from people who are actually employed. That being said, here's my gripe:*

I have been relentlessly inundated by the words ""AI, ML, Big Data"" throughout my undergrad from other CS majors, business and sales oriented people, media, and <insert-catchy-name>.ai type startups. It seems like everyone was peddling ML as the go to solution, the big money earner, and the future of the field. I've heard college freshman ask stuff like, ""if I want to do CS, am I going to need to learn ML to be relevant"" - if you're on this sub, I probably do not need to continue to elaborate on just how ridiculous the ML craze is.  Every single university has opened up ML departments or programs and are pumping out ML graduates at an unprecedented rate. **Surely, there'd be a job market to meet the incredible supply of graduates and cultural interest?**

Swept up in a mixture of genuine interest and hype, I decided to pursue computer vision. I majored in Math-CS at a [top-10](http://csrankings.org/#/index?all) CS university (based on at least one arbitrary ranking). I had three computer vision internships, two at startups, one at NASA JPL, in each doing non-trivial CV work; I (re)implemented and integrated CV systems from mixtures of recently published papers. I have a bunch of projects showing both CV and CS fundamentals (OS, networking, data structures, algorithms, etc) knowledge. I have taken graduate level ML coursework. I was accepted to Carnegie Mellon for an MS in Computer Vision, but I deferred to 2021 - all in all, I worked my ass off to try to simultaneously get a solid background in math AND computer science AND computer vision.

That brings me to where I am now, which is unemployed and looking for jobs. Almost every single position I have seen requires a PhD and/or 5+ years of experience, and whatever I have applied for has ghosted me so far. The notion that ML is a high paying in-demand field seems to only be true if your name is Andrej Karpathy - and I'm only sort of joking. It seems like unless you have a PhD from one of the big 4 in CS and multiple publications in top tier journals you're out of luck, or at least vying for one of the few remaining positions at small companies.

This seems normalized in ML, but this is not the case for quite literally every other subfield or even generalized CS positions. Getting a high paying job at a Big N company is possible as a new grad with just a bachelors and general SWE knowledge, and there are a plethora of positions elsewhere. Getting the equivalent with basically every specialization, whether operating systems, distributed systems, security, networking, etc, is also possible, and doesn't require 5 CVPR publications.

**TL;DR** **From my personal perspective,** **if you want to do ML because of career prospects, salaries, or job security, pick almost any other CS specialization**. In ML, you'll find yourself working 2x as hard through difficult theory and math to find yourself competing with more applicants for fewer positions.

I am absolutely complaining and would love to hear a more positive perspective, but in the meanwhile I'll be applying to jobs, working on more post-grad projects, and contemplating switching fields.

pkvt4n,[P] OpenSource d*ck pic detection model to improve womens online life,I would love for companies like facebook to gather statistics on how may d\*ck pics that are sent and in what context. For that they would need some AI model that is trained to detect a d\*ck pic. It seems like that would be pretty easy to find training material from the internet. It could be combined with classifications of how the interaction has been before the d\*ck pick was sent and after. Many women describe this as a huge problem online and especially celebrities. Isn't it about time that we get proper statistics on this? I don't know AI enough but perhaps someone would think this would be a fun project. The result of it could potentially be use to auto report users who send unsolicited d\*ck pics to say celebrities to make womens lives online more enjoyable. It would also be useful to get exact statistics of how widespread the problem is.

tflvuy,[P] Composer: a new PyTorch library to train models ~2-4x faster with better algorithms,"Hey all!

We're excited to release Composer ([https://github.com/mosaicml/composer](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer)), an open-source library to speed up training of deep learning models by integrating better algorithms into the training process!

[Time and cost reductions across multiple model families](https://preview.redd.it/0y54ykj8qrn81.png?width=3009&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5f14b3381828d0b9d71ab04a4f1f12ebfb07fd7)

Composer lets you train:

* A ResNet-101 to 78.1% accuracy on ImageNet in 1 hour and 30 minutes ($49 on AWS), **3.5x faster and 71% cheaper than the baseline.**
* A ResNet-50 to 76.51% accuracy on ImageNet in 1 hour and 14 minutes ($40 on AWS), **2.9x faster and 65% cheaper than the baseline.**
* A GPT-2 to a perplexity of 24.11 on OpenWebText in 4 hours and 27 minutes ($145 on AWS), **1.7x faster and 43% cheaper than the baseline.**

Composer features a **functional interface** (similar to `torch.nn.functional`), which you can integrate into your own training loop, and a **trainer,** which handles seamless integration of efficient training algorithms into the training loop for you.

**Industry practitioners:** leverage our 20+ vetted and well-engineered implementations of speed-up algorithms to easily reduce time and costs to train models. Composer's built-in trainer makes it easy to **add multiple efficient training algorithms in a single line of code.** Trying out new methods or combinations of methods is as easy as changing a single list, and [we provide training recipes](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer#resnet-101) that yield the best training efficiency for popular benchmarks such as ResNets and GPTs.

**ML scientists:** use our two-way callback system in the Trainer **to easily prototype algorithms for wall-clock training efficiency.**[ Composer features tuned baselines to use in your research](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer/tree/dev/composer/yamls), and the software infrastructure to help study the impacts of an algorithm on training dynamics. Many of us wish we had this for our previous research projects!

**Abstract**

>Recent research, such as BitNet, is paving the way for a new era of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a 1-bit LLM variant, namely BitNet b1.58, in which every single parameter (or weight) of the LLM is ternary {-1, 0, 1}. It matches the full-precision (i.e., FP16 or BF16) Transformer LLM with the same model size and training tokens in terms of both perplexity and end-task performance, while being significantly more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption. More profoundly, the 1.58-bit LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for training new generations of LLMs that are both high-performance and cost-effective. Furthermore, it enables a new computation paradigm and opens the door for designing specific hardware optimized for 1-bit LLMs.",465,139,Civil_Collection7267,2024-02-28 10:03:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1b22izk/r_the_era_of_1bit_llms_all_large_language_models/,0,MachineLearning

Maybe you might have seen me post on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/danielhanchen/status/1765446273661075609), but I'll just post here if you don't know about 8 bugs in multiple implementations on Google's Gemma :) The fixes should already be pushed into HF's transformers main branch, and Keras, Pytorch Gemma, vLLM should have gotten the fix :) [https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/29402](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/29402) I run an OSS package called [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) which also makes Gemma finetuning 2.5x faster and use 70% less VRAM :)

By comparing 5 implementations, I found the following issues:

1. Must add <bos> or else losses will be very high.
2. There’s a typo for model in the technical report!
3. sqrt(3072)=55.4256 but bfloat16 is 55.5.
4. Layernorm (w+1) must be in float32.
5. Keras mixed\_bfloat16 RoPE is wrong.
6. RoPE is sensitive to y\*(1/x) vs y/x.
7. RoPE should be float32 - already pushed to transformers 4.38.2.
8. GELU should be approx tanh not exact.

Adding all these changes allows the Log L2 Norm to decrease from the red  line to the black line (lower is better). Remember this is Log scale!  So the error decreased from 10\_000 to now 100 now - a factor of 100! The  fixes are primarily for long sequence lengths.

The most glaring one was adding BOS tokens to finetuning runs tames the  training loss at the start. No BOS causes losses to become very high.

Another very problematic issue was RoPE embeddings were done in bfloat16  rather than float32. This ruined very long context lengths, since  \[8190, 8191\] became upcasted to \[8192, 8192\]. This destroyed finetunes  on very long sequence lengths.

Another major issue was nearly all implementations except the JAX type ones used exact GELU, whilst approx GELU is the correct choice:

fhveru,[D] Researcher/Professor possibly using Wikipedia for personal gain,"I was trying to read about Natural Gradient Descent today, and found the Wikipedia section[1] to read just like an ad for a different technique[2]. I thought to myself that surely it must be a big deal to be in the Wikipedia article of SGD alongside RMSProp and Adam, but it turned out to be a paper for 2015 with 21 citations (not that citations are the measure of good science, but the maximally optimistic light would still be that it would be too early to include that along the canonical optimization algorithms of the field).

This seemed fishy to me so I did some digging. It was added to the Wikipedia article on Febuary 2017 [3], which at the time, the paper appears to have had 0 citations[4], by user Vp314 [5] on Wikipedia, which also happened to be the author's gmail username [6]. Furthermore the only edits that user has done on Wikipedia are related to adding their technique to the Wikipedia page on SGD [5]: one to add the original section[7], one to make a minor correction, and one to re-add that section[8] (in April 2018) after it was deleted with the comment ""Removed a recent extension which has been hardly cited by anyone in the academic community. Its appearance in Wikipedia made it look like an established technique, which is not"" [9].

My instincts are what this person has done is wrong and taking advantage of Wikipedia, but I would love to hear some other perspectives (and maybe get a little less angry). Is there a defensible reason to do so?

fgo70f,"[N] Due to concerns about COVID-19, ICLR2020 will cancel its physical conference this year, and instead host a fully virtual conference.","From their [page](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2020/virtual):

# ICLR2020 as a Fully Virtual Conference

Due to growing concerns about COVID-19, ICLR2020 will cancel its physical conference this year, instead shifting to a fully virtual conference. We were very excited to hold ICLR in Addis Ababa, and it is disappointing that we will not all be able to come together in person in April. This unfortunate event does give us the opportunity to innovate on how to host an effective remote conference. The organizing committees are now working to create a virtual conference that will be valuable and engaging for both presenters and attendees. 

Immediate guidance for authors, and questions about registration and participation are given below. We are actively discussing several options, with full details to be announced soon. 

## Information for Authors of Accepted Papers

All accepted papers at the virtual conference will be presented using a pre-recorded video. 

All accepted papers (poster, spotlight, long talk) will need to create a 5 minute video that will be used during the virtual poster session.

In addition, papers accepted as a long-talk should create a 15 minute video.

We will provide more detailed instructions soon, particularly on how to record your presentations. In the interim, please do begin preparing your talk and associated slides. 

Each video should use a set of slides, and should be timed carefully to not exceed the time allocation. The slides should be in widescreen format (16:9), and can be created in any presentation software that allows you to export to PDF (e.g., PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi, Beamer, etc). 

## Virtual Conference Dates

The conference will still take place between April 25 and April 30, as these are the dates people have allocated to attend the conference. We expect most participants will still commit their time during this window to participate in the conference, and have discussions with fellow researchers around the world. 

## Conference Registration Fee

The registration fee will be substantially reduced to 50 USD for students and 100 USD for non-students. For those who have already registered, we will automatically refund the remainder of the registration fee, so that you only pay this new reduced rate. Registration provides each participant with an access code to participate in sessions where they can ask questions of speakers, see questions and answers from other participants, take part in discussion groups, meet with sponsors, and join groups for networking. Registration furthermore supports the infrastructure needed to host and support the virtual conference. 

## Registration Support 

There will be funding available for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to get registration reimbursed, with similar conditions to the Travel Support Application. If you have already applied for and received a travel grant for ICLR 2020, you will get free registration for ICLR 2020. The Travel Application on the website will be updated soon, to accept applications for free registration, with the deadline extended to April 10, 2020. 

## Workshops

We will send details for workshops through the workshop organisers soon, but it is expected that these will follow a similar virtual format to the main conference.

fewkop,[R] [P] 15.ai - A deep learning text-to-speech tool for generating natural high-quality voices of characters with minimal data (MIT),"https://fifteen.ai/ (or https://15.ai/)

From the website:

> This is a text-to-speech tool that you can use to generate 44.1 kHz voices of various characters. The voices are generated in real time using multiple audio synthesis algorithms and customized deep neural networks trained on very little available data (between 30 and 120 minutes of clean dialogue for each character). This project demonstrates a significant reduction in the amount of audio required to realistically clone voices while retaining their affective prosodies.

The author (who is only known by the moniker ""15"" and is presumed to be a researcher at MIT) thanks MIT CSAIL for providing the initial funding, along with other related organizations. Notably, the author thanks specific boards on the anonymous imageboard 4chan for their respective roles in the project, which he references throughout the website via its various in-jokes and memes.

mhrpbm,[D] Keras: Killed by Google,"First of all, this is not a rant about Tensorflow (it actually is but more on that later). Disclaimer: I have been working on research projects with Teano, JAX, PT, TF 1 &2, and of course the original Keras.

The **original Keras** was just a high-level API specification for machine learning, which was really nice when collaborating with people who have less engineering background. The API was framework agnostic and the main implementation supported multiple backends (Teano, Tensorflow, and MS-CNTK)

Essentially, the API design resembled the abstractions of modern high-level frameworks such as PyTorch-Lightning and fast.ai, with slightly different *design* *flavors* (e.g., a Keras model combines the network with the metrics and training code in a single object, whereas other frameworks usually separate the network from the learner object).

The huge advantage of keras was that it was available and the API stable **back in 2016, 2017.** I think this is something remarkable in a field that moves so fast.

But then, you know the story, Google announced its plans to incorporated it into Tensorflow 2. This wouldn't have been a problem on its own, but it slowly killed keras for 3 reasons:

1. During the time-span of this merge, the keras API was effectively ""frozen"", making it lag behind alternatives in terms of features
2. The release of TF2 came too late. On top of that, the first versions were buggy and even now are lacking some basic features.
3. Instead of making a hard cut between TF 1 and 2, Google decided that it's better to carried over a lot of baggage and crap from TF1, making the framework extremely bloated. When something does not work, you get overwhelmed by long cryptic error messages and stacktraces longer than your screen can visualize.

So, this post is really intended as a **funeral for the keras API**.

Looking forward to know your thoughts.

EDIT: I have nothing personal against Google. Far from it, I really like their impressive contributions to ML (Colab, TPU, JAX, ...), but the story with keras and TF2 is really frustrating for me who liked working with it in the past.",468,63,yusuf-bengio,2021-04-01 09:37:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/mhrpbm/d_keras_killed_by_google/,0,MachineLearning

d9jidd,"[N] HuggingFace releases Transformers 2.0, a library for state-of-the-art NLP in TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch","HuggingFace has just released Transformers 2.0, a library for Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch which provides state-of-the-art pretrained models in most recent NLP architectures (BERT, GPT-2, XLNet, RoBERTa, DistilBert, XLM...) comprising several multi-lingual models.

An interesting feature is that the library provides deep interoperability between TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch.

You can move a full model seamlessly from one framework to the other during its lifetime (instead of just exporting a static computation graph at the end like with ONNX). This way it's possible to get the best of both worlds by selecting the best framework for each step of training, evaluation, production, e.g. train on TPUs before finetuning/testing in PyTorch and finally deploy with TF-X.

An [example in the readme](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers#quick-tour-tf-20-training-and-pytorch-interoperability) shows how Bert can be finetuned on GLUE in a few lines of code with the high-level API `tf.keras.Model.fit()` and then loaded in PyTorch for quick and easy inspection and debugging.

As TensorFlow and PyTorch as getting closer, this kind of deep interoperability between both frameworks could become a new norm for multi-backends libraries.

jc1fp2,"[R] NeurIPS 2020 Spotlight, AdaBelief optimizer, trains fast as Adam, generalize well as SGD, stable to train GAN.","**Abstract**

Optimization is at the core of modern deep learning. We propose AdaBelief optimizer to simultaneously achieve three goals: fast convergence as in adaptive methods, good generalization as in SGD, and training stability.

The intuition for AdaBelief is to adapt the stepsize according to the ""belief"" in the current gradient direction. Viewing the exponential moving average (EMA) of the noisy gradient as the prediction of the gradient at the next time step, if the observed gradient greatly deviates from the prediction, we distrust the current observation and take a small step; if the observed gradient is close to the prediction, we trust it and take a large step.

We validate AdaBelief in extensive experiments, showing that it outperforms other methods with fast convergence and high accuracy on image classification and language modeling. Specifically, on ImageNet, AdaBelief achieves comparable accuracy to SGD. Furthermore, in the training of a GAN on Cifar10, AdaBelief demonstrates high stability and improves the quality of generated samples compared to a well-tuned Adam optimizer.

dw7sms,[D] Working on an ethically questionnable project...,"Hello all,

I'm writing here to discuss a bit of a moral dilemma I'm having at work with a new project we got handed. Here it is in a nutshell : 

>Provide a tool that can gauge a person's personality just from an image of their face. This can then be used by an HR office to help out with sorting job applicants.

So first off, there is no concrete proof that this is even possible. I mean, I have a hard time believing that our personality is characterized by our facial features. [Lots of papers](http://alittlelab.com/littlelab/pubs/Little_07_personality_composites.pdf) claim this to be possible, but they don't give accuracies above 20%-25%. (And if you are detecting a person's personality using the big 5, this is simply random.) This branch of [pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiognomy) was discredited in the Middle Ages for crying out loud.

Second, if somehow there is a correlation, and we do develop this tool, I don't want to be anywhere near the training of this algorithm. What if we underrepresent some population class? What if our algorithm becomes racist/ sexist/ homophobic/ etc... The social implications of this kind of technology used in a recruiter's toolbox are huge.

Now the reassuring news is that the team I work with all have the same concerns as I do. The project is still in its State-of-the-Art phase, and we are hoping that it won't get past the Proof-of-Concept phase. Hell, my boss told me that it's a good way to ""empirically prove that this mumbo jumbo does not work.""

What do you all think?",452,279,big_skapinsky,2019-11-14 10:39:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/dw7sms/d_working_on_an_ethically_questionnable_project/,0,MachineLearning

fmg41r,[D] (Rant) What annoys me the most in a time of Machine Learning hype and the current pandemic.,"First, this rant is not against people that really know their stuff, knowing the limits of ML and other approaches.

Too many people in the recent years looked at machine learning approaches as a sort of silver bullet solutions. The approach seems like: ""ah you build a neural network (or whatever other technique that sounds cool) and after a bit of time it should quickly find the solutions for your"". Then they proceed to mention deepmind achievements with alphazero, muzero, alphago, alphastar and so on.

Some months ago I read here, if I am not mistaken, a nice subthread in a discussion where some people pointed out that it all depends on how good the domain is modeled.  
If the domain is incomplete, inaccurate or wrong, the most effective machine learning techniques won't help. Some people, correctly, pointed out that one cannot boast ML methods if at the end the problem is not properly modeled.

The best example to me is the current pandemic. If those methods would be a that effective, we *could* expect quick solutions. Instead modeling the problem of a disease in a human body is so complex that good luck. Surely it will be eventually done, even if with good approximations, but to get the point - that the domain has to be properly simulated - into the most hyped people is really hard. And even when the simulation is proper, it is not granted that a good solution will be found.

That is really frustrating at times in a discussion. Sometimes one reads ""Go is incredibly complex, why shouldn't they achieve a similar goal for real life problems"", and that shows how people underestimate reality.",453,124,pier4r,2020-03-21 14:52:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/fmg41r/d_rant_what_annoys_me_the_most_in_a_time_of/,0,MachineLearning

from [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKkEdTchsiE), but I've watched several -- they are similar, but not identical. The following is not a summary of all the talks, but just of his critique of the state of ML, paraphrased from memory (He also talks about H-JEPA, which I'm ignoring here):

* LLMs cannot be commercialized, because content owners ""like reddit"" will sue (Curiously prescient in light of the recent NYT lawsuit)
* Current ML is bad, because it requires enormous amounts of data, compared to humans (I think there are two very distinct possibilities: the algorithms themselves are bad, or humans just have a lot more ""pretraining"" in childhood)
* Scaling is not enough
* Autoregressive LLMs are doomed, because any error takes you out of the correct path, and the probability of not making an error quickly approaches 0 as the number of outputs increases
* LLMs cannot reason, because they can only do a finite number of computational steps
* Modeling probabilities in continuous domains is wrong, because you'll get infinite gradients
* Contrastive training (like GANs and BERT) is bad. You should be doing regularized training (like PCA and Sparse AE)
* Generative modeling is misguided, because much of the world is unpredictable or unimportant and should not be modeled by an intelligent system
* Humans learn much of what they know about the world via passive visual observation (I think this *might* be contradicted by the fact that the congenitally blind can be pretty intelligent)
* You don't need giant models for intelligent behavior, because a mouse has just tens of millions of neurons and surpasses current robot AI",449,204,we_are_mammals,2024-01-12 19:14:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/19534v6/what_do_you_think_about_yann_lecuns_controversial/,0,MachineLearning

gmy6p0,[N] Windows is adding CUDA/cuDNN support to WSL,"Windows users will soon be able to train neural networks on the GPU using the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directx-heart-linux/

Relevant excerpt:
>We are pleased to announce that NVIDIA CUDA acceleration is also coming to WSL! CUDA is a cross-platform API and can communicate with the GPU through either the WDDM GPU abstraction on Windows or the NVIDIA GPU abstraction on Linux.

>We worked with NVIDIA to build a version of CUDA for Linux that directly targets the WDDM abstraction exposed by /dev/dxg. This is a fully functional version of libcuda.so which enables acceleration of CUDA-X libraries such as cuDNN, cuBLAS, TensorRT.

>Support for CUDA in WSL will be included with NVIDIA’s WDDMv2.9 driver. Similar to D3D12 support, support for the CUDA API will be automatically installed and available on any glibc-based WSL distro if you have an NVIDIA GPU. The libcuda.so library gets deployed on the host alongside libd3d12.so, mounted and added to the loader search path using the same mechanism described previously.

>In addition to CUDA support, we are also bringing support for NVIDIA-docker tools within WSL. The same containerized GPU workload that executes in the cloud can run as-is inside of WSL. The NVIDIA-docker tools will not be pre-installed, instead remaining a user installable package just like today, but the package will now be compatible and run in WSL with hardware acceleration.

>For more details and the latest on the upcoming NVIDIA CUDA support in WSL, please visit https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl

k978cq,HS student project [Project],"First off, I just joined, so if this post is not appropriate for this sub, please say so.  I'm a high school math and CS teacher in Vermont, USA. I have a student who is working on an independent project that is waaaay beyond the CS knowledge/ability of anyone in my building.  He is investigating the question of whether an AI can create ""true art"". The student maintains a blog as a part of documenting his progress/learning and for a while I was able to give him feedback that was meaningful to some extent but at this point, as I said, he's beyond me.

So -- with his permission -- I am posting a link to his blog and to his Github account.  I would love it if a few people here would take a look at what he's doing and leave him a comment about his work. My biggest concern is that I can't help him identify moments when he doesn't know what he doesn't know.

Why should you do this? Well, this student is pretty off the charts in terms of CS. I would be surprised if he doesn't end up changing tech for the world at some point. If you read and comment on his blog, you'll be able to say, ""Oh yeah, I knew that guy before anyone had heard of him.""  😀 And even if he doesn't become famous some day, he's still a kid who is full of ideas and would benefit from some adult interest, support in his work. Think of it as your good deed for the day.

eg8mmn,[D] The 1997 LSTM paper by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber has become the most cited deep learning research paper of the 20th century,"- Long short-term memory. S Hochreiter, J Schmidhuber. Neural computation, MIT Press, 1997 (26k citations as of 2019)

It has passed the backpropagation papers by Rumelhart et al. (1985, 1986, 1987). Don't get confused by Google Scholar which sometimes incorrectly lumps together different Rumelhart publications including: 

- Learning internal representations by error propagation. DE Rumelhart, GE Hinton, RJ Williams, California Univ San Diego La Jolla, Inst for Cognitive Science, 1985 (25k)

- Parallel distributed processing. JL McClelland, DE Rumelhart, PDP Research Group, MIT press, 1987 (24k)

- Learning representations by back-propagating errors. DE Rumelhart, GE Hinton, RJ Williams, Nature 323 (6088), 533-536, 1986 (19k) 

I think it's good that the backpropagation paper is no longer number one, because it's a bad role model. It does not cite the true inventors of backpropagation, and the authors have never corrected this. I learned this on reddit: [Schmidhuber on Linnainmaa, inventor of backpropagation in 1970](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/e5vzun/d_jurgen_schmidhuber_on_seppo_linnainmaa_inventor/). This post also mentions Kelley (1960) and Werbos (1982). 

The LSTM paper is now receiving more citations per year than all of Rumelhart's backpropagation papers combined. And  more than the most cited paper by LeCun and Bengio (1998) which is about CNNs: 

- Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. Y LeCun, L Bottou, Y Bengio, P Haffner, IEEE 86 (11), 2278-2324, 1998 (23k)
 
It may soon have more citations than Bishop's textbook on neural networks (1995).  

In the 21st century, activity in the field has surged, and I found three deep learning research papers with even more citations. All of them are about applications of neural networks to ImageNet (2012, 2014, 2015). One paper describes a fast, CUDA-based, deep CNN (AlexNet) that won ImageNet 2012. Another paper describes a significantly deeper CUDA CNN that won ImageNet 2014:  

- A Krizhevsky, I Sutskever, GE Hinton. Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. NeuerIPS 2012 (53k) 

- B. K Simonyan, A Zisserman. Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition. arXiv:1409.1556, 2014 (32k)

The paper with the most citations per year is a recent one on the much deeper ResNet which won ImageNet 2015: 

- K He, X Zhang, S Ren, J Sun. Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition. CVPR 2016 (36k; 18k in 2019)

Remarkably, such ""contest-winning deep GPU-based CNNs"" can also be traced back to the Schmidhuber lab. Krizhevsky cites DanNet, the first CUDA CNN to win image recognition challenges and the first superhuman CNN (2011). I learned this on reddit: [DanNet, the CUDA CNN of Dan Ciresan in Jürgen Schmidhuber's team, won 4 image recognition challenges prior to AlexNet](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/dwnuwh/d_dannet_the_cuda_cnn_of_dan_ciresan_in_jurgen/): ICDAR 2011 Chinese handwriting contest - IJCNN 2011 traffic sign recognition contest - ISBI 2012 image segmentation contest - ICPR 2012 medical imaging contest.  

ResNet is much deeper than DanNet and AlexNet and works even better. It cites the [Highway Net](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/highway-networks.html) (Srivastava & Greff & Schmidhuber, 2015) of which it is a special case. In a sense, this closes the LSTM circle, because ""Highway Nets are essentially feedforward versions of recurrent Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.""

Most LSTM citations refer to the 1997 LSTM paper. However, Schmidhuber's [post on their Annus Mirabilis](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204) points out that ""essential insights"" for LSTM date back to Seep Hochreiter's 1991 diploma thesis which he considers ""one of the most important documents in the history of machine learning."" (He also credits other students: ""LSTM and its training procedures were further improved"" ""through the work of my later students Felix Gers, Alex Graves, and others."")

The LSTM principle is essential for both recurrent networks and feedforward networks. Today it is on every smartphone. And in Deepmind's Starcraft champion and OpenAI's Dota champion. And in thousands of additional applications. It is the core of the deep learning revolution.",452,81,None,2019-12-27 08:29:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/eg8mmn/d_the_1997_lstm_paper_by_hochreiter_schmidhuber/,0,MachineLearning

cjtmi8,[D] What I'd like to write in my NeurIPS rebuttal,"We thank the reviewers for their detailed comments, of which some were even based on our paper.

To the reviewer that said our paper was ""underdeveloped"" because we didn't use a different methodology Y from field Z, we'd like to point out that a) this is in field A, b) we provided a framework for how to extend this to other methodologies in field A, and c) methodology Y has no obvious way to extend to the problem we're addressing (and doing so would be a whole paper in its own right).  Do you often read papers and get frustrated that they aren't the papers you've written?

To the same reviewer, who asked why we didn't cite papers Z1 and Z2, we would again point out that this isn't field Z and those papers have no relevance to the topic at hand except that you'd have written a paper on a different topic, which we didn't.

To the reviewer that asked why we didn't cite X, we'd like to point out that we did cite X, and had a whole paragraph discussing the relationship of this work to that one.

To the reviewer that proposed an example dataset to evaluate our model on, we point out that we already evaluate the model on that data set; see our Experiments section.

To the reviewer that pointed out that our method won't work when assumption 3 isn't met, yes, you're correct.  That's why we stated it as an assumption.  Congratulations on your reading comprehension.

To the reviewer that directly copy/pasted our introduction into the ""what 3 things does this paper contribute"" box, we'll be sure to include in future revisions a copy/paste-able review justifying ""score 10, confidence 5"" to make your review easier.  That you also confused our main claim with a work we were citing, and otherwise completely missed the discussion on relationship to prior work or what makes this paper novel, makes your review particularly useful to development of the work.

To the reviewer that wrote that, while THEY were familiar with the definitions in a reference, we should explain it for readers that might be confused, we understand entirely.  We'll gladly explain it for ""a friend of yours"", err ""readers"", and not you, because you get it and you're smart and it's just the readers who don't.

To the reviewer who commented that our results were ""contradictory"" because we said that our modification ""in general performed slightly worse"" on this metric, when in fact our plots show it sometimes performed better, we'll gladly fix our claim to be clear that ""in general"" doesn't mean ""always"" and also our results are even better than the previous wording indicated.

To the reviewer that said our comparison method's results were worse than reported in the original paper, we've carefully compared their bar charts to ours and found that the results are the same to the precision of the graphical printout in the previous paper.  If you could lend us your image sharpening function so we can get more significant digits out of their plot, we'd be glad to redo the comparison.

To the reviewer who used half of their review to argue that our entire subfield is dumb and wrong, we thank them for reaching across academic lines to provide commentary in an area that pains you deeply.

And finally, to the reviewers who called our paper (all actual quotes) ""original, well-motivated, and worthy of study"", ""important in its own right"", that said you ""greatly enjoyed reading this paper"" and that ""this is an interesting problem and certainly worth studying"" and that ""this paper identifies an important problem ... [and the authors] then present a simple"" solution, thank you for also marking this a reject.  Since all of you gave us scores between 5 and 3, neither the AC nor any of you will ever have to read this response or reconsider your scores before we are inevitably rejected, but we hope that your original, well-motivated, worth-studying, important, interesting, clear papers receive reviews of equal quality in the future!

l6bncg,[R] Why is it so hard to get ML code to work!? I am doing so poorly as an undergrad research assistant it is stressing me out.,"I volunteered to help out with a machine learning group at school and was assigned to assist a PhD student. I was asked to implement some baseline knowledge graph completion models since mid Sept but I still can't figure out how to get them to work! I spent 3 months to finally get a few models on github to work properly, but only after spending countless hours hunting out the problems in the preprocessing and evaluation code.


Now, I was asked to add another layer on top of the baselines. The PhD student directed me to another github repo from a paper that implements similar things. I just plugged my existing code into the it and somehow the model went to shit again! I went through every steps but just can't figure out what's wrong.

I can't do it anymore... Every week's meeting with the PhD student is just filled with dread knowing I have no progress to report again. I know I am not a bad coder when it comes to projects in other fields so what is wrong? Is this the nature of ML code? Is there something wrong with my brain? How do you guys debug? How can I keep track of which freaking tensor is using 11G of memory!! besides adding print(tensor.shape) everywhere!?

---

Edit: 

Thank you for all the support and suggestions! Was not expecting this at all. Few problems I identified are:
* Lack of communication with the PhD student and other research members, so I have no idea how to work on a project like this properly.
* Lack of theoretical understanding and familiarity with the model and pipeline set up so I had a hard time diagnosing the problem.

It's great to have a way to break out of my own insular research bubble and spread out a bit more. Unfortunately, it looks like that era has passed.

The sub has been seemingly shifting away from research in the past 1-2 years.

I don't mean to assert that this is a bad thing, as the constant upvotes indicate that there is a high demand for LLM projects and research. Heck, I'm also interested in lots of the recent work with LLMs, and I plan to keep up with it – but I also would also love a venue with a diversity of ideas and topics. Machine learning is a HUGE field, and only focusing on a small subset of it seems like a waste.

I've just finished a detailed analysis of **300+ ML competitions** from 2023, including a look at the winning solutions for 65 of those.

A few highlights:

* As expected, **almost all winners used Python**. One winner used C++ for an optimisation problem where performance was key, and another used R for a time-series forecasting competition.
* **92% of deep learning solutions used PyTorch**. The remaining 8% we found used TensorFlow, and all of those used the higher-level Keras API. About 20% of winning PyTorch solutions used PyTorch Lightning.
* **CNN-based models won more computer vision competitions than Transformer-based ones**.
* In NLP, unsurprisingly, **generative LLMs are starting to be used**. Some competition winners used them to generate synthetic data to train on, others had creative solutions like adding classification heads to open-weights LLMs and fine-tuning those. There are also more competitions being launched targeted specifically at LLM fine-tuning.
* Like last year, **gradient-boosted decision tree libraries (LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost) are still widely used** by competition winners. LightGBM is slightly more popular than the other two, but the difference is small.
* **Compute usage varies a lot**. NVIDIA GPUs are obviously common; a couple of winners used TPUs; we didn’t find any winners using AMD GPUs; several trained their model on CPU only (especially timeseries). Some winners had access to powerful (e.g. 8x A6000/8x V100) setups through work/university, some trained fully on local/personal hardware, quite a few used cloud compute.
* There were quite a few high-profile competitions in 2023 (we go into detail on **Vesuvius Challenge** and **M6 Forecasting**), and more to come in 2024 (Vesuvius Challenge Stage 2, AI Math Olympiad, AI Cyber Challenge)

ep8m3q,[R] Using neural networks to solve advanced mathematics equations,"Facebook AI has built the first AI system that can solve advanced mathematics equations using symbolic reasoning. By developing a new way to represent complex mathematical expressions as a kind of language and then treating solutions as a translation problem for sequence-to-sequence neural networks, we built a system that outperforms traditional computation systems at solving integration problems and both first- and second-order differential equations.

Previously, these kinds of problems were considered out of the reach of deep learning models, because solving complex equations requires precision rather than approximation. Neural networks excel at learning to succeed through approximation, such as recognizing that a particular pattern of pixels is likely to be an image of a dog or that features of a sentence in one language match those in another. Solving complex equations also requires the ability to work with symbolic data, such as the letters in the formula b - 4ac = 7. Such variables can’t be directly added, multiplied, or divided, and using only traditional pattern matching or statistical analysis, neural networks were limited to extremely simple mathematical problems.

Our solution was an entirely new approach that treats complex equations like sentences in a language. This allowed us to leverage proven techniques in neural machine translation (NMT), training models to essentially translate problems into solutions. Implementing this approach required developing a method for breaking existing mathematical expressions into a language-like syntax, as well as generating a large-scale training data set of more than 100M paired equations and solutions.

When presented with thousands of unseen expressions — equations that weren’t part of its training data — our model performed with significantly more speed and accuracy than traditional, algebra-based equation-solving software, such as Maple, Mathematica, and Matlab. This work not only demonstrates that deep learning can be used for symbolic reasoning but also suggests that neural networks have the potential to tackle a wider variety of tasks, including those not typically associated with pattern recognition. We’re sharing details about our approach as well as methods to help others generate similar training sets.

A new way to apply NMT

Humans who are particularly good at symbolic math often rely on a kind of intuition. They have a sense of what the solution to a given problem should look like — such as observing that if there is a cosine in the function we want to integrate, then there may be a sine in its integral — and then do the necessary work to prove it. This is different from the direct calculation required for algebra. By training a model to detect patterns in symbolic equations, we believed that a neural network could piece together the clues that led to their solutions, roughly similar to a human’s intuition-based approach to complex problems. So we began exploring symbolic reasoning as an NMT problem, in which a model could predict possible solutions based on examples of problems and their matching solutions.

An example of how our approach expands an existing equation (on the left) into an expression tree that can serve as input for a translation model. For this equation, the preorder sequence input into our model would be: (plus, times, 3, power, x, 2, minus, cosine, times, 2, x, 1).

To implement this application with neural networks, we needed a novel way of representing mathematical expressions. NMT systems are typically sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, using sequences of words as input, and outputting new sequences, allowing them to translate complete sentences rather than individual words. We used a two-step approach to apply this method to symbolic equations. First, we developed a process that effectively unpacks equations, laying them out in a branching, treelike structure that can then be expanded into sequences that are compatible with seq2seq models. Constants and variables act as leaves, while operators (such as plus and minus) and functions are the internal nodes that connect the branches of the tree.

&#x200B;

Though it might not look like a traditional language, organizing expressions in this way provides a language-like syntax for equations — numbers and variables are nouns, while operators act as verbs. Our approach enables an NMT model to learn to align the patterns of a given tree-structured problem with its matching solution (also expressed as a tree), similar to matching a sentence in one language with its confirmed translation. This method lets us leverage powerful, out-of-the-box seq2seq NMT models, swapping out sequences of words for sequences of symbols.

&#x200B;

Building a new data set for training

Though our expression-tree syntax made it theoretically possible for an NMT model to effectively translate complex math problems into solutions, training such a model would require a large set of examples. And because in the two classes of problems we focused on — integration and differential equations — a randomly generated problem does not always have a solution, we couldn’t simply collect equations and feed them into the system. We needed to generate an entirely novel training set consisting of examples of solved equations restructured as model-readable expression trees. This resulted in problem-solution pairs, similar to a corpus of sentences translated between languages. Our set would also have to be significantly larger than the training data used in previous research in this area, which has attempted to train systems on thousands of examples. Since neural networks generally perform better when they have more training data, we created a set with millions of examples.

&#x200B;

Building this data set required us to incorporate a range of data cleaning and generation techniques. For our symbolic integration equations, for example, we flipped the translation approach around: Instead of generating problems and finding their solutions, we generated solutions and found their problem (their derivative), which is a much easier task. This approach of generating problems from their solutions — what engineers sometimes refer to as trapdoor problems — made it feasible to create millions of integration examples. Our resulting translation-inspired data set consists of roughly 100M paired examples, with subsets of integration problems as well as first- and second-order differential equations.

&#x200B;

We used this data set to train a seq2seq transformer model with eight attention heads and six layers. Transformers are commonly used for translation tasks, and our network was built to predict the solutions for different kinds of equations, such as determining a primitive for a given function. To gauge our model’s performance, we presented it with 5,000 unseen expressions, forcing the system to recognize patterns within equations that didn’t appear in its training. Our model demonstrated 99.7 percent accuracy when solving integration problems, and 94 percent and 81.2 percent accuracy, respectively, for first- and second-order differential equations. Those results exceeded those of all three of the traditional equation solvers we tested against. Mathematica achieved the next best results, with 84 percent accuracy on the same integration problems and 77.2 percent and 61.6 percent for differential equation results. Our model also returned most predictions in less than 0.5 second, while the other systems took several minutes to find a solution and sometimes timed out entirely.

Our model took the equations on the left as input — equations that both Mathematica and Matlab were unable to solve — and was able to find correct solutions (shown on the right) in less than one second.

Comparing generated solutions to reference solutions allowed us to easily and precisely validate the results. But our model is also able to produce multiple solutions for a given equation. This is similar to what happens in machine translation, where there are many ways to translate an input sentence.

What’s next for equation-solving AI

Our model currently works on problems with a single variable, and we plan to expand it to multiple-variable equations. This approach could also be applied to other mathematics- and logic-based fields, such as physics, potentially leading to software that assists scientists in a broad range of work.

But our system has broader implications for the study and use of neural networks. By discovering a way to use deep learning where it was previously seen as unfeasible, this work suggests that other tasks could benefit from AI. Whether through the further application of NLP techniques to domains that haven’t traditionally been associated with languages, or through even more open-ended explorations of pattern recognition in new or seemingly unrelated tasks, the perceived limitations of neural networks may be limitations of imagination, not technology.

143gzz3,[R] AlphaDev discovers faster sorting algorithms,"Blog post: https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphadev-discovers-faster-sorting-algorithms

Fundamental algorithms such as sorting or hashing are used trillions of times on any given day. As demand for computation grows, it has become critical for these algorithms to be as performant as possible. Whereas remarkable progress has been achieved in the past, making further improvements on the efficiency of these routines has proved challenging for both human scientists and computational approaches. Here we show how artificial intelligence can go beyond the current state of the art by discovering hitherto unknown routines. To realize this, we formulated the task of finding a better sorting routine as a single-player game. We then trained a new deep reinforcement learning agent, AlphaDev, to play this game. AlphaDev discovered small sorting algorithms from scratch that outperformed previously known human benchmarks. These algorithms have been integrated into the LLVM standard C++ sort library. This change to this part of the sort library represents the replacement of a component with an algorithm that has been automatically discovered using reinforcement learning. We also present results in extra domains, showcasing the generality of the approach.",432,77,RobbinDeBank,2023-06-07 15:56:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/143gzz3/r_alphadev_discovers_faster_sorting_algorithms/,0,MachineLearning

Abstract:

>Large language models excel at a wide range of complex tasks. However, enabling general inference in the real world, e.g., for robotics problems, raises the challenge of grounding. We propose embodied language models to directly incorporate real-world continuous sensor modalities into language models and thereby establish the link between words and percepts. Input to our embodied language model are multi-modal sentences that interleave visual, continuous state estimation, and textual input encodings. We train these encodings end-to-end, in conjunction with a pre-trained large language model, for multiple embodied tasks including sequential robotic manipulation planning, visual question answering, and captioning. Our evaluations show that PaLM-E, a single large embodied multimodal model, can address a variety of embodied reasoning tasks, from a variety of observation modalities, on multiple embodiments, and further, **exhibits positive transfer**: the model benefits from diverse joint training across internet-scale language, vision, and visual-language domains. **Our largest model, PaLM-E-562B with 562B parameters, in addition to being trained on robotics tasks, is a visual-language generalist with state-of-the-art performance on OK-VQA, and retains generalist language capabilities with increasing scale.**

dj5psh,[N] New AI neural network approach detects heart failure from a single heartbeat with 100% accuracy,">Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a severe pathophysiological condition  associated with high prevalence, high mortality rates, and sustained  healthcare costs, therefore demanding efficient methods for its  detection. **Despite recent research has provided methods focused on  advanced signal processing and machine learning, the potential of  applying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approaches to the automatic  detection of CHF has been largely overlooked thus far.** This study  addresses this important gap by presenting a CNN model that accurately  identifies CHF on the basis of one raw electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeat  only, also juxtaposing existing methods typically grounded on Heart  Rate Variability. **We trained and tested the model on publicly available  ECG datasets, comprising a total of 490,505 heartbeats, to achieve 100%  CHF detection accuracy.** Importantly, the model also identifies those  heartbeat sequences and ECG’s morphological characteristics which are  class-discriminative and thus prominent for CHF detection. Overall, our  contribution substantially advances the current methodology for  detecting CHF and caters to clinical practitioners’ needs by providing  an accurate and fully transparent tool to support decisions concerning  CHF detection.

I posted about not being able to reproduce a paper today and apparently it struck a chord with a lot of people who have faced the issue.

I'm not sure if this is the best or worst idea ever but I figured it would be useful to collect a list of papers which people have tried to reproduce and failed. This will give the authors a chance to either release their code, provide pointers or rescind the paper. My hope is that this incentivizes a healthier ML research culture around not publishing unreproducible work.

I realize that this system can be abused so in order to ensure that the reputation of the authors is not unnecessarily tarnished, the authors will be given a week to respond and their response will be reflected in the spreadsheet. It would be great if this can morph into a post-acceptance OpenReview kind of thing where the authors can have a dialogue with people trying to build off their work.

This is ultimately an experiment so I'm open to constructive feedback that best serves our community.

srbvnc,[P] C++ Machine Learning Library Built From Scratch by a 16-Year-Old High Schooler,"Hello r/MachineLearning!

In this post, I will be explaining why I decided to create a machine learning library in C++ from scratch.

If you are interested in taking a closer look at it, the GitHub repository is available here: [https://github.com/novak-99/MLPP](https://github.com/novak-99/MLPP). To give some background, the library is over 13.0K lines of code and incorporates topics from statistics, linear algebra, numerical analysis, and of course, machine learning and deep learning. I have started working on the library since I was 15.

Quite honestly, the main reason why I started this work is simply because C++ is my language of choice. The language is efficient and is good for fast execution. When I began looking over the implementations of various machine learning algorithms, I noticed that most, if not all of the implementations, were in Python, MatLab, R, or Octave. My understanding is that the main reason for C++’s lack of usage in the ML sphere is due to the lack of user support and the complex syntax of C++. There are thousands of libraries and packages in Python for mathematics, linear algebra, machine learning and deep learning, while C++ does not have this kind of user support. You could count the most robust libraries for machine learning in C++ on your fingers.

There is one more reason why I started developing this library. I’ve noticed that because ML algorithms can be implemented so easily, some engineers often glance over or ignore the implementational and mathematical details behind them. This can lead to problems along the way because specializing ML algorithms for a particular use case is impossible without knowing its mathematical details. As a result, along with the library, I plan on releasing comprehensive documentation which will explain all of the mathematical background behind each machine learning algorithm in the library and am hoping other engineers will find this helpful. It will cover everything from statistics, to linear regression, to the Jacobian and backpropagation. The following is an excerpt from the statistics section:

[https://ibb.co/w4MDGvw](https://ibb.co/w4MDGvw)

Well, everyone, that’s all the background I have for this library. If you have any comments or feedback, don't hesitate to share!

&#x200B;

**Edit:** 

Hello, everyone! Thank you so much for upvoting and taking the time to read my post- I really appreciate it. 

I would like to make a clarification regarding the rationale for creating the library- when I mean C++ does not get much support in the ML sphere, I am referring to the language in the context of a frontend for ML and not a backend. Indeed, most libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Numpy, all use either C/C++ or some sort of C/C++ derivative for optimization and speed. 

When it comes to C++ as an ML frontend- it is a different story. The amount of frameworks in machine learning for C++ pale in comparison to the amount for Python. Moreover, even in popular frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, the implementations for C++ are not as complete as those for Python: the documentation is lacking, not all of the main functions are present, not many are willing to contribute, etc.

In addition, C++ does not have support for various key libraries of Python's ML suite. Pandas lacks support for C++ and so does Matplotlib. This increases the implementation time of ML algorithms because the elements of data visualization and data analysis are more difficult to obtain.",431,87,novak-99,2022-02-13 06:13:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/srbvnc/p_c_machine_learning_library_built_from_scratch/,0,MachineLearning

odkdsv,[D] Growing beyond a deep learning PhD,"Hi, throwaway because everyone in my lab uses reddit.

I am doing a PhD in machine learning but my field is heavily based in computer vision and also some techniques from natural language processing, so I'm mostly doing deep learning.

I have some conference contributions, but none of them in major conferences. Reviewers are always fairly critical but I have not gotten a rejection yet (though last time was pretty close).

I get why they are critical too. I'm not a top student, our lab is not a top lab, and what I do is mostly repurpose existing methods for different domains. Think taking a ResNet and applying it to medical imaging, or transformers for music classification (not actually my domains).

I feel like compared to many others, I heavily lack in mathematical background even though I try to read up, I often immediately forget concepts that I don't actually apply. I couldn't tell you what the rank of a matrix is, let alone how to use it.

This is partly why I don't really come up with new methods. I'm better at combining existing stuff, but it doesn't feel like research but more like engineering at times.

Because my contributions are fairly underwhelming, I don't think I will be able to achieve a career in academia. So I will likely look for a job in the industry.

But there I would like to be able to show something more than ""I applied method X to data Y and got a slightly better result so I published it"".

Do you have any tips for (1) growing beyond the niche of your PhD, and (2) making actual contributions that are not purely incremental and applied during your PhD?

Perhaps side projects that I should do if I have some left over energy in the weekend?

Quote from the Github page:

This book is the result of the collective wisdom of many people who  have sat on both sides of the table and who have spent a lot of time  thinking about the hiring process. It was written with candidates in  mind, but hiring managers who saw the early drafts told me that they  found it helpful to learn how other companies are hiring, and to rethink  their own process.

The book consists of two parts. The first part provides an overview  of the machine learning interview process, what types of machine  learning roles are available, what skills each role requires, what kinds  of questions are often asked, and how to prepare for them. This part  also explains the interviewers’ mindset and what kind of signals they  look for.

The second part consists of over 200 knowledge questions, each noted  with its level of difficulty -- interviews for more senior roles should  expect harder questions -- that cover important concepts and common  misconceptions in machine learning.",430,30,lkhphuc,2021-06-23 13:03:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/o6ce13/d_machine_learning_interview_book_by_huyen_chip/,0,MachineLearning
dq82x7,[Discussion] A Questionable SIGIR 2019 Paper,"I recently read the paper ""Adversarial Training for Review-Based Recommendations"" published on the SIGIR 2019 conference. I noticed that this paper is almost exactly the same as the paper ""Why I like it: Multi-task Learning for Recommendation and Explanation"" published on the RecSys 2018 conference.

At first, I thought it is just a coincidence. It is likely for researchers to have similar ideas. Therefore it is possible that two research groups independently working on the same problem come up with the same solution. However, after thoroughly reading and comparing the two papers, now I believe that the SIGIR 2019 paper is plagiarizing the RecSys 2018 paper.

The model proposed in the SIGIR 2019 paper is almost a replicate of the model in the RecSys 2018 paper. (1) Both papers used an adversarial sequence-to-sequence learning model on top of the matrix factorization framework. (2) For the generator and discriminator part, both papers use GRU for generator and CNN for discriminator. (3) The optimization methodology is the same, i.e. alternating optimization between two parts. (4) The evaluations are the same, i.e. evaluating MSE for recommendation performance and evaluating the accuracy for discriminator to show that the generator has learned to generate relevant reviews. (5) The notations and also the formulas that have been used by the two papers look extremely similar.

While ideas can be similar given that adversarial training has been prevalent in the literature for a while, it is suspicious for the SIGIR 2019 paper to have large amount of text overlaps with the RecSys 2018 paper.

Consider the following two sentences:

(1) ""The Deep Cooperative Neural Network (DeepCoNN) model user-item interactions based on review texts by utilizing a factorization machine model on top of two convolutional neural networks."" in Section 1 of the SIGIR 2019 paper.

(2) ""Deep Cooperative Neural Network (DeepCoNN) model user-item interactions based on review texts by utilizing a factorization machine model on top of two convolutional neural networks."" in Section 2 of the RecSys 2018 paper.

I think this is the most obvious sign of plagiarism. If you search Google for this sentence using ""exact match"", you will find that this sentence is only used by these two papers. It is hard to believe that the authors of the SIGIR 2019 paper could come up with the exact same sentence without reading the RecSys 2018 paper.

As another example:

(1) ""The decoder employs a single GRU that iteratively produces reviews word by word. In particular, at time step $t$ the GRU first maps the output representation $z\_{ut-1}$ of the previous time step into a $k$-dimensional vector $y\_{ut-1}$ and concatenates it with $\\bar{U\_{u}}$ to generate a new vector $y\_{ut}$. Finally, $y\_{ut}$ is fed to the GRU to obtain the hidden representation $h\_{t}$, and then $h\_{t}$ is multiplied by an output projection matrix and passed through a softmax over all the words in the vocabulary of the document to represent the probability of each word. The output word $z\_{ut}$ at time step $t$ is sampled from the multinomial distribution given by the softmax."" in Section 2.1 of the SIGIR 2019 paper.

(2) ""The user review decoder utilizes a single decoder GRU that iteratively generates reviews word by word. At time step $t$, the decoder GRU first embeds the output word $y\_{i, t-1}$ at the previous time step into the corresponding word vector $x\_{i, t-1} \\in \\mathcal{R}\^{k}$, and then concatenate it with the user textual feature vector $\\widetilde{U\_{i}}$. The concatenated vector is provided as input into the decoder GRU to obtain the hidden activation $h\_{t}$. Then the hidden activation is multiplied by an output projection matrix and passed through a softmax over all the words in the vocabulary to represent the probability of each word given the current context. The output word $y\_{i, t}$ at time step $t$ is sampled from the multinomial distribution given by the softmax."" in Section 3.1.1 of the RecSys 2018 paper.

In this example, the authors of the SIGIR 2019 paper has replaced some of the phrases in the writing so that the two texts are not exactly the same. However, I believe the similarity of the two texts still shows that the authors of the SIGIR 2019 paper must have read the RecSys 2018 paper before writing their own paper.

I do not intend to go through all the text overlaps between the two papers, but let us see a final example:

(1) ""Each word of the review $r$ is mapped to the corresponding word vector, which is then concatenated with a user-specific vector. Notice that the user-specific vectors are learned together with the parameters of the discriminator $D\_{\\theta}$ in the adversarial training of Section 2.3. The concatenated vector representations are then processed by a convolutional layer, followed by a max-pooling layer and a fully-connected projection layer. The final output of the CNN is a sigmoid function which normalizes the probability into the interval of $\[0, 1\]$"", expressing the probability that the candidate review $r$ is written by user $u$."" in Section 2.2 of the SIGIR 2019 paper.

(2) ""To begin with, each word in the review is mapped to the corresponding word vector, which is then concatenated with a user-specific vector that identifies user information. The user-specific vectors are learned together with other parameters during training. The concatenated vector representations are then processed by a convolutional layer, followed by a max-pooling layer and a fully-connected layer. The final output unit is a sigmoid non-linearity, which squashes the probability into the $\[0, 1\]$ interval."" in Section 3.1.2 of the RecSys 2018 paper.

There is one sentence (""The concatenated vector representations are ...... a fully-connected projection layer."") that is exactly the same in the two papers. Also, I think concatenating the user-specific vectors to every word vector in the review is a very unintuitive idea. I do not think ideas from different research groups can be the same in that granularity of detail. If I were the authors, I will just concatenate the user-specific vectors to the layer before the final projection layer, as it saves computational cost and should lead to better generalization.

As a newbie in information retrieval, I am not sure if such case should be considered as plagiarism. However, as my professor told me that the SIGIR conference is the premier conference in the IR community, I believe that this paper definitely should not be published at a top conference such as SIGIR.

What makes me feel worse is that the two authors of this paper, Dimitrios Rafailidis from Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands and Fabio Crestani from Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), Lugano, Switzerland, are both professors. They should be aware that plagiarism is a big deal in academia.

has got me thinking. A source code requirement would make this by far the most reproducible community in the history of experimental science. Our experiments are programs that run *DETERMINISTICALLY*. If you speak with other scientific communities about our reproducibility issues, they are baffled.

And let's be honest, any reason against doing so are from incentives that are misaligned with the idea of reproducible research (secrecy for competition, not enough time to submit to every conference).

1btuizd,[D] LLMs causing more harm than good for the field?,"This post might be a bit ranty, but i feel more and more share this sentiment with me as of late. If you bother to read this whole post feel free to share how you feel about this.

When OpenAI put the knowledge of AI in the everyday household, I was at first optimistic about it. In smaller countries outside the US, companies were very hesitant before about AI, they thought it felt far away and something only big FANG companies were able to do. Now? Its much better. Everyone is interested in it and wants to know how they can use AI in their business. Which is great!

Pre-ChatGPT-times, when people asked me what i worked with and i responded ""Machine Learning/AI"" they had no clue and pretty much no further interest (Unless they were a tech-person)

Post-ChatGPT-times, when I get asked the same questions I get ""Oh, you do that thing with the chatbots?""

Its a step in the right direction, I guess. I don't really have that much interest in LLMs and have the privilege to work exclusively on vision related tasks unlike some other people who have had to pivot to working full time with LLMs.

However, right now I think its almost doing more harm to the field than good. Let me share some of my observations, but before that I want to highlight I'm in no way trying to gatekeep the field of AI in any way.

I've gotten job offers to be ""ChatGPT expert"", What does that even mean? I strongly believe that jobs like these don't really fill a real function and is more of a ""hypetrain""-job than a job that fills any function at all.

Over the past years I've been going to some conferences around Europe, one being last week, which has usually been great with good technological depth and a place for Data-scientists/ML Engineers to network, share ideas and collaborate. However, now the talks, the depth, the networking has all changed drastically. No longer is it new and exiting ways companies are using AI to do cool things and push the envelope, its all GANs and LLMs with surface level knowledge. The few ""old-school"" type talks being sent off to a 2nd track in a small room  
The panel discussions are filled with philosophists with no fundamental knowledge of AI talking about if LLMs will become sentient or not. The spaces for data-scientists/ML engineers are quickly dissapearing outside the academic conferences, being pushed out by the current hypetrain.  
The hypetrain evangelists also promise miracles and gold with LLMs and GANs, miracles that they will never live up to. When the investors realize that the LLMs cant live up to these miracles they will instantly get more hesitant with funding for future projects within AI, sending us back into an AI-winter once again.

EDIT: P.S. I've also seen more people on this reddit appearing claiming to be ""Generative AI experts"". But when delving deeper it turns out they are just ""good prompters"" and have no real knowledge, expertice or interest in the actual field of AI or Generative AI.",424,168,Stevens97,2024-04-02 09:37:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1btuizd/d_llms_causing_more_harm_than_good_for_the_field/,0,MachineLearning

1. Over the next couple years, someone will come up with an optimizer/optimization approach that completely changes how people optimize neural networks. In particular, there's quite some evidence that the neural network training doesn't quite work how we think it is. For one, there's several papers showing that very early stages of training are far more important than the rest of training. There's also other papers isolating interesting properties of training like the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis.

2. GANs are going to get supplanted by another generative model paradigm - probably VAEs, flow-based methods, or energy-based models. I think there's just too many issues with GANs - in particular lack of diversity. Despite the 50 papers a year claiming to solve mode collapse, oftentimes GANs still seem to have issues with representatively sampling the data distribution (e.g: PULSE).

1373nhq,[Discussion]: Mark Zuckerberg on Meta's Strategy on Open Source and AI during the earnings call,"During  the recent earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg answered a question from Eric  Sheridan of Goldman Sachs on Meta's AI strategy, opportunities to  integrate into products, and why they open source models and how it  would benefit their business.

I found the reasoning to be very sound and promising for the OSS and AI community.

The  biggest risk from AI, in my opinion, is not the doomsday scenarios that  intuitively come to mind but rather that the most powerful AI systems  will only be accessible to the most powerful and resourceful  corporations.

Quote copied from Ben Thompson's write up on Meta's earning in his [Stratechery blog post](https://stratechery.com/2023/facebook-earnings-generative-ai-and-messaging-monetization-open-source-and-ai/) which goes beyond AI. *It's behind a paywall but I highly recommend it personally.*

Some noteworthy quotes that signal the thought process at Meta FAIR and more broadly

* We’re just playing a different game on the infrastructure  than companies like Google or Microsoft or Amazon
* We would aspire to and hope to make even more open than that. So, we’ll need to figure out a way to do that.
* ...lead us to do more work in terms of open sourcing, some of the lower level models and tools
* Open sourcing low level tools make the way we run all this infrastructure more efficient over time.
* On  PyTorch: It’s generally been very valuable for us to provide that  because now  all of the best developers across the industry are using  tools that  we’re also using internally.
* I would expect us to be pushing and helping  to build out an open ecosystem.

For  all the negative that comes out of the popular discourse on Meta, I  think their work to open source key tech tools over the last 10 years  has been exceptional, here's hoping it continues into this decade of AI  and pushes other tech giants to also realize the benefits of Open  Source.

Full Transcript:

>Right  now most of the companies that are training large language  models have  business models that lead them to a closed approach to development. I  think **there’s an** **important opportunity to help create an  open ecosystem.**  If we can help be a part of this, then much of the  industry will  standardize on using these open tools and help improve  them further. So  this will make it easier for other companies to  integrate with our  products and platforms as we enable more  integrations, and that will  help our products stay at the leading edge  as well.  
Our  approach to AI and our infrastructure has always been fairly  open. We  open source many of our state of the art models so people can   experiment and build with them. This quarter we released our LLaMa LLM   to researchers. It has 65 billion parameters but outperforms larger   models and has proven quite popular. We’ve also open-sourced three other   groundbreaking visual models along with their training data and model   weights — Segment Anything, DinoV2, and our Animated Drawings tool —  and  we’ve gotten positive feedback on all of those as well.  
I  think that there’s an important distinction between the products we  offer and a lot of the technical infrastructure, especially the software  that we write to support that. And historically, whether it’s the Open  Compute project that we’ve done or just open sourcing a lot of the   infrastructure that we’ve built, we’ve historically open sourced a lot   of that infrastructure, even though we haven’t open sourced the code for   our core products or anything like that.  
And the reason why I think why we do this is that unlike some of  the other companies in the space, **we’re not selling a cloud computing service** **where we try to keep the different software infrastructure that we’re building proprietary.** For us, **it’s way better if the industry  standardizes on the basic tools that we’re using**  and therefore we can benefit from the improvements that others make and  others’ use of those tools can, in some cases like Open Compute, **drive down the costs** of  those things which make our business more efficient too. So I think to  some degree **we’re just playing a different game** on the infrastructure  than companies like Google or Microsoft or Amazon, and that creates different incentives for us.  
So overall, I think **that that’s going to lead us to do more work in terms of open sourcing, some of the lower level models and tools**.  But of  course, a lot of the product work itself is going to be  specific and  integrated with the things that we do. So it’s not that  everything we do is going to be open. Obviously, a bunch of this needs  to be developed in a way that creates unique value for our products, but  I think in  terms of the basic models, **I would expect us to be pushing and helping  to build out an open ecosystem** here, which I think is something that’s  going to be important.  
On the AI tools, and we have a bunch of history here, right? So if you  if you look at what we’ve done with **PyTorch**,  for example, which has  generally become the standard in the industry  as a tool that a lot of  folks who are building AI models and different  things in that space use,  **it’s generally been very valuable** for us to provide that because now  all of the **best developers across the industry are using tools that  we’re also using internally**.  So the tool chain is the same. So when they create some innovation, we  can easily integrate it into the things that we’re doing. When we  improve something, it improves other products too. Because it’s  integrated with our technology stack, when there are opportunities to  make integrations with products, it’s much easier to  make sure that  developers and other folks are compatible with the things  that we need  in the way that our systems work.  
So there are a lot of advantages, but **I view this more as a kind of back end infrastructure advantage with potential integrations on the  product side**,  but one that should hopefully enable us to stay at the  leading edge  and integrate more broadly with the community and also make  the way we  run all this infrastructure more efficient over time. There  are a  number of models. I just gave PyTorch as an example. Open Compute  is  another model that has worked really well for us in this way, both to   incorporate both innovation and scale efficiency into our own   infrastructure.  
So I think that  there’s, our incentives I think are basically  aligned towards moving in  this direction. Now that said, there’s a lot  to figure out, right? So  when you asked if there are going to be other opportunities, I hope so. I  can’t speak to what all those things might  be now. This is all quite  early in getting developed. **The better we do at the foundational work, the more opportunities** I think that will come and present themselves. So I think that that’s all stuff that we need to  figure out. But at least **at the base level, I think we’re generally incentivized to move in this direction**. And we also need to figure out  how to go in that direction over time.  
I  mean, I mentioned LLaMA before and I also want to be clear that  while  I’m talking about helping contribute to an open ecosystem, LLaMA  is a  model that we only really made available to researchers and there’s  a  lot of really good stuff that’s happening there. But a lot of the  work  that we’re doing, I think, **we would aspire to and hope to make even more open than that. So, we’ll need to figure out a way to do that.**",425,84,noiseinvacuum,2023-05-03 23:48:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1373nhq/discussion_mark_zuckerberg_on_metas_strategy_on/,0,MachineLearning
ppy7k4,[N] Inside DeepMind's secret plot to break away from Google,"Article https://www.businessinsider.com/deepmind-secret-plot-break-away-from-google-project-watermelon-mario-2021-9

by Hugh Langley and Martin Coulter

> For a while, some DeepMind employees referred to it as ""Watermelon."" Later, executives called it ""Mario."" Both code names meant the same thing: a secret plan to break away from parent company Google.
> 
> DeepMind feared Google might one day misuse its technology, and executives worked to distance the artificial-intelligence firm from its owner for years, said nine current and former employees who were directly familiar with the plans. 
> 
> This included plans to pursue an independent legal status that would distance the group's work from Google, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.
> 
> One core tension at DeepMind was that it sold the business to people it didn't trust, said one former employee. ""Everything that happened since that point has been about them questioning that decision,"" the person added.
> 
> Efforts to separate DeepMind from Google ended in April without a deal, The Wall Street Journal reported. The yearslong negotiations, along with recent shake-ups within Google's AI division, raise questions over whether the search giant can maintain control over a technology so crucial to its future.
> 
> ""DeepMind's close partnership with Google and Alphabet since the acquisition has been extraordinarily successful — with their support, we've delivered research breakthroughs that transformed the AI field and are now unlocking some of the biggest questions in science,"" a DeepMind spokesperson said in a statement. ""Over the years, of course we've discussed and explored different structures within the Alphabet group to find the optimal way to support our long-term research mission. We could not be prouder to be delivering on this incredible mission, while continuing to have both operational autonomy and Alphabet's full support.""
> 
> When Google acquired DeepMind in 2014, the deal was seen as a win-win. Google got a leading AI research organization, and DeepMind, in London, won financial backing for its quest to build AI that can learn different tasks the way humans do, known as artificial general intelligence.
> 
> But tensions soon emerged. Some employees described a cultural conflict between researchers who saw themselves firstly as academics and the sometimes bloated bureaucracy of Google's colossal business. Others said staff were immediately apprehensive about putting DeepMind's work under the control of a tech giant. For a while, some employees were encouraged to communicate using encrypted messaging apps over the fear of Google spying on their work.
> 
> At one point, DeepMind's executives discovered that work published by Google's internal AI research group resembled some of DeepMind's codebase without citation, one person familiar with the situation said. ""That pissed off Demis,"" the person added, referring to Demis Hassabis, DeepMind's CEO. ""That was one reason DeepMind started to get more protective of their code.""
> 
> After Google restructured as Alphabet in 2015 to give riskier projects more freedom, DeepMind's leadership started to pursue a new status as a separate division under Alphabet, with its own profit and loss statement, The Information reported.
> 
> DeepMind already enjoyed a high level of operational independence inside Alphabet, but the group wanted legal autonomy too. And it worried about the misuse of its technology, particularly if DeepMind were to ever achieve AGI.
> 
> Internally, people started referring to the plan to gain more autonomy as ""Watermelon,"" two former employees said. The project was later formally named ""Mario"" among DeepMind's leadership, these people said.
> 
> ""Their perspective is that their technology would be too powerful to be held by a private company, so it needs to be housed in some other legal entity detached from shareholder interest,"" one former employee who was close to the Alphabet negotiations said. ""They framed it as 'this is better for society.'""
> 
> In 2017, at a company retreat at the Macdonald Aviemore Resort in Scotland, DeepMind's leadership disclosed to employees its plan to separate from Google, two people who were present said.
> 
> At the time, leadership said internally that the company planned to become a ""global interest company,"" three people familiar with the matter said. The title, not an official legal status, was meant to reflect the worldwide ramifications DeepMind believed its technology would have.
> 
> Later, in negotiations with Google, DeepMind pursued a status as a company limited by guarantee, a corporate structure without shareholders that is sometimes used by nonprofits. The agreement was that Alphabet would continue to bankroll the firm and would get an exclusive license to its technology, two people involved in the discussions said. There was a condition: Alphabet could not cross certain ethical redlines, such as using DeepMind technology for military weapons or surveillance. 
> 
> In 2019, DeepMind registered a new company called DeepMind Labs Limited, as well as a new holding company, filings with the UK's Companies House showed. This was done in anticipation of a separation from Google, two former employees involved in those registrations said.
> 
> Negotiations with Google went through peaks and valleys over the years but gained new momentum in 2020, one person said. A senior team inside DeepMind started to hold meetings with outside lawyers and Google to hash out details of what this theoretical new formation might mean for the two companies' relationship, including specifics such as whether they would share a codebase, internal performance metrics, and software expenses, two people said.
> 
> From the start, DeepMind was thinking about potential ethical dilemmas from its deal with Google. Before the 2014 acquisition closed, both companies signed an ""Ethics and Safety Review Agreement"" that would prevent Google from taking control of DeepMind's technology, The Economist reported in 2019. Part of the agreement included the creation of an ethics board that would supervise the research. 
> 
> Despite years of internal discussions about who should sit on this board, and vague promises to the press, this group ""never existed, never convened, and never solved any ethics issues,"" one former employee close to those discussions said. A DeepMind spokesperson declined to comment.
> 
> DeepMind did pursue a different idea: an independent review board to convene if it were to separate from Google, three people familiar with the plans said. The board would be made up of Google and DeepMind executives, as well as third parties. Former US president Barack Obama was someone DeepMind wanted to approach for this board, said one person who saw a shortlist of candidates.
> 
> DeepMind also created an ethical charter that included bans on using its technology for military weapons or surveillance, as well as a rule that its technology should be used for ways that benefit society. In 2017, DeepMind started a unit focused on AI ethics research composed of employees and external research fellows. Its stated goal was to ""pave the way for truly beneficial and responsible AI."" 
> 
> A few months later, a controversial contract between Google and the Pentagon was disclosed, causing an internal uproar in which employees accused Google of getting into ""the business of war."" 
> 
> Google's Pentagon contract, known as Project Maven, ""set alarm bells ringing"" inside DeepMind, a former employee said. Afterward, Google published a set of principles to govern its work in AI, guidelines that were similar to the ethical charter that DeepMind had already set out internally, rankling some of DeepMind's senior leadership, two former employees said.
> 
> In April, Hassabis told employees in an all-hands meeting that negotiations to separate from Google had ended. DeepMind would maintain its existing status inside Alphabet. DeepMind's future work would be overseen by Google's Advanced Technology Review Council, which includes two DeepMind executives, Google's AI chief Jeff Dean, and the legal SVP Kent Walker.
> 
> But the group's yearslong battle to achieve more independence raises questions about its future within Google.
> 
> Google's commitment to AI research has also come under question, after the company forced out two of its most senior AI ethics researchers. That led to an industry backlash and sowed doubt over whether it could allow truly independent research.
> 
> Ali Alkhatib, a fellow at the Center for Applied Data Ethics, told Insider that more public accountability was ""desperately needed"" to regulate the pursuit of AI by large tech companies. 
> 
> For Google, its investment in DeepMind may be starting to pay off. Late last year, DeepMind announced a breakthrough to help scientists better understand the behavior of microscopic proteins, which has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery.
> 
> As for DeepMind, Hassabis is holding on to the belief that AI technology should not be controlled by a single corporation. Speaking at Tortoise's Responsible AI Forum in June, he proposed a ""world institute"" of AI. Such a body might sit under the jurisdiction of the United Nations, Hassabis theorized, and could be filled with top researchers in the field. 
> 
> ""It's much stronger if you lead by example,"" he told the audience, ""and I hope DeepMind can be part of that role-modeling for the industry.""",425,137,MassivePellfish,2021-09-17 11:17:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ppy7k4/n_inside_deepminds_secret_plot_to_break_away_from/,0,MachineLearning

g9urkz,[R] Animal Crossing AI workshop -- Call for Abstracts ACAI 2020,"**Animal Crossing Artificial Intelligence Workshop**

[http://acaiworkshop.com/](http://acaiworkshop.com/)

We are announcing the first AI workshop hosted in Animal Crossing New Horizons. This is an experiment to see what it feels like to experience a workshop located in Animal Crossing. We would like to build a space for AI researchers to have meaningful interactions, and share their work. 

This workshop is partially in response to the world in quarantine for Corona Virus. All academic conferences are now remote. One of the most valuable parts of conferences are the conversations and random interactions shared with colleagues. This is missing from most remote conferences. We hope to fill that void, by hosting a workshop in the virtual space of Animal Crossing, while having Zoom rooms where attendees can network and have conversations. The talks will be presented in a workshop area on an Animal Crossing Island. The actual audio, slide shows, and the virtual conference space will be live streamed to all attendees over Zoom. 

​

**Call for Abstracts**

We welcome abstract submissions from any domain of AI, however we highly encourage presentations in the following fields:  
​

* Computational models of narrative
* Automatic speech recognition
* Image generation 
* Natural language understanding
* Conversational AI
* Computer vision
* Computational creativity
* Music information retrieval
* Automatic musical understanding
* Video game AI

We are highlighting these topics due to their relationship to Animal Crossing and interacting with virtual characters. These fields have the potential to affect the depth of the interactions between people and virtual characters in any context, be they Animal Crossing villagers, virtual companions, or even virtual teachers. 

If you are interested in submitting, please head over to the [Submit an Abstract](http://acaiworkshop.com/submit-an-abstract.html) page.

[http://acaiworkshop.com/submit-an-abstract.html](http://acaiworkshop.com/submit-an-abstract.html)

​

**Presentation Logistics**

Each presentation will be 15 minutes long, followed by 5 minutes of questions from the audience. There are two components to each presentation: 1) Your Animal Crossing character will *give* the presentation in a workshop area on our workshop island. There will be workshop attendees on the island to *listen* to your talk. 2) You will call into a Zoom room, and give your talk over video call. You can also share your screen if you wish to use slides or whatever visual materials you desire. 

**Coffee Breaks + Chance Interactions** ☕☕☕☕

Since our desire is to replicate the social interactions of a real workshop, we will schedule coffee breaks into the workshop. We will have many different Zoom rooms so that smaller conversations can happen simultaneously. We want to provide a virtual space for you (the participant) to meet other researchers, and make meaningful connections. 

**Organizers**

This workshop is being organized by me, [Josh Eisenberg](http://www.research-josh.com/) PhD. I am an NLU researcher who focuses on teaching computers to understand narrative and dialogue. I am currently the lead scientist in NLU at [Artie Inc](http://artie.com/). I am putting this workshop together to build meaningful connections with other like-minded AI researchers, who also just happen to enjoy Animal Crossing.

i9kztq,[D] Hidden Gems and Underappreciated Resources,"Hey everyone, I’ve seen a lot of resource sharing on this subreddit over the past couple of years. Threads like the [Advanced Courses Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/fdw0ax/d_advanced_courses_update/) and this [RL thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/h940xb/what_is_the_best_way_to_learn_about_reinforcement/) have been great to learn about new courses.

I'm currently working on a project to curate the currently massive number of ML resources, and I noticed that there are courses like CS231n or David Silver's that come up repeatedly (for a good reason). But there seems to be lots of other quality resources that don't receive as much widespread appreciation.

So, here are a few **hidden gems** that, imo, deserve more love:

**Causal Inference**

* [Duke Causal Inference bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/c/ModUPowerfulConceptsinSocialScience/playlists) (2015): Over 100 videos to understand ideas like counterfactuals, instrumental variables, differences-in-differences, regression discontinuity etc. Imo, the most approachable and complete videos series on Causal Inference (although it's definitely rooted in an Economics perspective rather than CS/ML, i.e. a lot closer to Gary King's work than Bernhard Schölkopf's).
* [Elements of Causal Inference](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-causal-inference) (2017): A textbook that introduces the reader to causality and some of its connections to ML. 200 pages of content on the cause-effect problem, multivariate causal models, hidden variables, time series and more. Alternatively, this [4-part lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvrcyqcN9Wo&t=1296s) by Peters goes through a lot of the same topics from the book. And for a more up-to-date survey of Causality x ML, Schölkopf's [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10500) will be your best bet.
* [MLSS Africa](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC722CmQVgcLtxt_jXr3RyWg/videos) (2019): Beyond a collection of other great talks, this Machine Learning Summer School has recorded tutorials on Causal Discovery by Bernhard Schölkopf and Causal Inference in Everyday ML by Ferenc Huszár. For an even more recent causality tutorial by Schölkopf, head to this year's virtual MLSS [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBOgpkDhQuYeVVjuzS5Wtxw/videos).
* [Online Causal Inference Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiiOj5GSES6uw21kfXnxj3A/videos) (2020-present): For a collection of talks on current research, check out this virtual seminar. Talks by researchers like Andrew Gelman, Caroline Uhler or Ya Xu will give you an overview of the frontiers of causal inference in both industry and academia.

&#x200B;

**Computer Vision**

* [UW The Ancient Secrets of CV](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjMXczUzEYcHvw5YYSU92WrY8IwhTuq7p) (2018): Created by the first author of YOLO, this is likely the most well-rounded computer vision course as it not only teaches you the deep learning side of CV but  ""older"" methods like SIFT and optical flow as well.
* [UMichigan Deep Learning for CV](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r) (2019): An evolution of the beloved CS231n, this course is taught by one of its former head instructors Justin Johnson. Similar in many ways, the UMichigan version is more up-to-date and includes lectures on Transformers, 3D and video + Colab/PyTorch homework.
* [TUM Advanced Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLog3nOPCjKBnjhuHMIXu4ISE4Z4f2jm39) (2020): This course is great for anyone who has already taken an intro CV or DL course and wants to explore ideas like neural rendering, interpretability and GANs further. Taught by Laura Leal-Taixé and Matthias Niessner.
* [MIT Vision Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLMiFkFyfcNnZs6iwYLPI9g) (2020-present): A bunch of recorded videos of vision researchers giving talks on their current projects and thoughts. Devi Parikh's talk on language, vision and applications of ML in creative pursuits as well as Matthias Niessner's talk on Yuval Bahat's talk on explorable super resolution and some of its potential applications were quite fun.

&#x200B;

**Deep Learning**

* [Stanford Analyses/Theories of Deep Learning](https://stats385.github.io/lecture_videos) (2017 & 2019): This one was mentioned in the Advanced course thread, but only linked to the 2017 videos. Whether ML from a robustness perspective, overparameterization of neural nets or deep learning through random matrix theory, Stats 385 has a myriad of fascinating talks on theoretical deep learning. It's a shame most of these fantastic lectures only have a few hundred views.
* [Princeton IAS' Workshops](https://www.math.ias.edu/sp/sycoe) (2019-2020): The Institute for Advanced Study has held a series of workshops on matters such as new directions in ML as part of its Special Year on Optimization, Statistics and Theoretical Machine Learning. Most of these wonderful talks can be found on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/videosfromIAS/videos).
* [TUM Intro to DL](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ8Y4kIIbzy_OaXv86lfbQwPHSomk2o2e) (2020): If the advanced CV course is a bit too difficult for you, this course (taught by the same professors) is the corresponding prerequisite course you can take prior to starting the advanced version.
* [MIT Embodied Intelligence Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnXGbvgu9071i3koFooncAw/videos) (2020-ongoing): Similar to MIT's Vision Seminar, but organized by MIT's embodied intelligence group. Oriol Vinyal's talk on Deep Learning toolkit was really neat as it was basically a bird's eye view of Deep Learning and its different submodules.

&#x200B;

**Graphs**

* [Stanford Machine Learning with Graphs](http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-videos-2019/?utm_campaign=OpenMLU%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2019): The course was also mentioned in the Advanced course thread, but only linked to the slides. While some of the lectures sporadically appear on YouTube, if you simply go to the above website, you can just download every lecture. It covers topics like networks, data mining and graph neural networks. Taught by Jure Leskovec and Michele Catasta.
* [CMU Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoZgVqqHOumTqxIhcdcpOAJOOimrRCGZn&utm_campaign=OpenMLU%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2020): If you want to learn more about PGMs, this course is the way to go. From the basics of graphical models to approximate inference to deep generative models, RL, causal inference and applications, it covers a lot of ground for just one course. Taught by Eric Xing.

&#x200B;

**ML Engineering**

* [Stanford Massive Computational Experiments, Painlessly](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Massive-Computational-Experiments-Painlessly?utm_campaign=OpenMLU%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2018): Did you ever feel confused about cluster computing, containers or scaling experiments in the cloud? Then this is the right place for you. As indicated by the name, you’ll come out of the course with a much better understanding of cloud computing, distributed tools and research infrastructure.
* [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/?utm_campaign=OpenMLU%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2019): This course is basically a bootcamp to learn best practices for your ML projects. From infrastructure to data management to model debugging to deployment, if there is one course you need to take to become a better ML Engineer, this is it.

&#x200B;

**Robotics**

* [QUT Robot Academy](https://robotacademy.net.au/?utm_campaign=OpenMLU%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2017): A lot of robotics material online is concerned with the software side of the field, whereas this course (taught by Peter Corke) will teach you more about the basics of body dynamics, kinematics and joint control. Complementary resources that dive deeper into these concepts are [Kevin Lynch's 6-part MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics#courses) (2017) and [corresponding book](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/images/2/25/MR-v2.pdf) (2019) on robot motion, kinematics, dynamics, planning, control and manipulation.
* [MIT Underactuated Robotics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkx8KyIQkMfVG-tWyV3CcQbon0Mh5zYaj&utm_campaign=OpenMLU%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2019): In this course Russ Tedrake will teach you about nonlinear dynamics and control of underactuated mechanical systems from a computational perspective. Throughout the lectures and readings you will apply newly acquired knowledge through problems expressed in the context of differential equations, ML, optimization, robotics and programming.
* [UC Berkeley Advanced Robotics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwRJQ4m4UJjNBPJdt8WamRAt4XKc639wF&utm_campaign=OpenMLU%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2019): With a bigger focus on ML, Pieter Abbeel guides you through the foundations of MDPs, Motion Planning, Particle Filters, Imitation Learning, Physics Simulations and many other topics. Particularly recommended to anyone with an interest in RL x Robotics.
* [Robotics Today Seminar](https://roboticstoday.github.io/) (2020-ongoing): An ongoing series of technical talks by various Robotics researchers. Particularly recommend the talks by Anca Dragan on optimizing intended reward functions and Scott Kuindersma on Boston Dynamics' recent progress on Atlas.

chc220,[Research] Neural Point-Based Graphics,"Hey all,

&#x200B;

Let me introduce our new work on *real-time photo-realistic* neural rendering. The method allows you to render complex scenes from *novel viewpoints* using *raw point clouds* as proxy geometry and require no meshes. Pipeline is following: scan object  with ordinary video camera, produce the point cloud using widely available software (e.g. Agisoft Metashape), feed the point cloud and video to the algorithm and that's it! At inference time *only* point cloud with learned descriptors is required.

&#x200B;

The core ingredient of our algorithm is 8-dimensional descriptors learned for each point in the cloud, instead of common 3-dimensional RGB colors. Rendering neural network interprets this descriptors and outputs RGB image. We train the network on large [Scannet](http://www.scan-net.org/) dataset to boost it's generalization capabilities on novel scenes.

&#x200B;

For more details please refer to the paper, as well as short description of the method on the project page and video demonstrating the results.

Source: https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition

Today, it was announced that Sam Altman will no longer be CEO or affiliated with OpenAI due to a lack of “candidness” with the board. This is extremely unexpected as Sam Altman is arguably the most recognizable face of state of the art AI (of course, wouldn’t be possible without great team at OpenAI). Lots of speculation is in the air, but there clearly must have been some good reason to make such a drastic decision.

This may or may not materially affect ML research, but it is plausible that the lack of “candidness” is related to copyright data, or usage of data sources that could land OpenAI in hot water with regulatory scrutiny. Recent lawsuits (https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/writers-suing-openai-fire-back-companys-copyright-defense-2023-09-28/) have raised questions about both the morality and legality of how OpenAI and other research groups train LLMs.

I had some time between jobs so I wanted a hobby project where I can learn some Python. The result is a Twitter bot that is watching a bird feeder in my backyard for birds. If any birds are spotted, it tries to identify the species through a classification model. Both object detection and specie classification are done through existing models on TensorFlow hub. 

Nothing novel or new about this, but wanted to share this silly thing I put together.

 The first article is published, each week 2 articles will be published, but **if you want to be alerted about the next article, follow me on Medium and/or follow the github repo below**

I wrote these articles because I wanted to have articles that begin with the big picture (understand the concept in simpler terms), then the mathematical implementation and finally a Tensorflow implementation **explained step by step** (each part of the code is commented). And too much articles missed the implementation part or just give the code without any comments.

va0p9u,[P] [R] Deep Learning Classifier for Sex Positions,"Hello! I build some sex position classifiers using state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning! The best results were achieved by combining three input streams: RGB, Skeleton, and Audio. The current top accuracy is 75%. This would certainly be improved with a larger dataset.

Basically, human action recognition (HAR) is applied to the adult content domain. It presents some technical difficulties, especially due to the enormous variation in camera position (the challenge is to classify actions based on a single video).

The main input stream is the RGB one (as opposed to the skeleton one) and this is mostly due to the relatively small dataset (\~44hrs). It is difficult to get an accurate pose estimation (which is a prerequisite for building robust skeleton-HAR models) for most of the videos due to the proximity of the human bodies in the frames. Hence there simply weren't enough data to include all the positions in the skeleton-based model.

The audio input stream on the other hand is only used for a handful of actions, where deriving some insight is possible.

Check it out on Github for a detailed description: [https://github.com/rlleshi/phar](https://github.com/rlleshi/phar)

Possible use-cases include:

1. Improving the recommender system
2. Automatic tag generator

* abandon probabilistic model
   * in favor of energy based models
* abandon contrastive methods

105v7el,[R] Greg Yang's work on a rigorous mathematical theory for neural networks," Greg Yang is a mathematician and AI researcher at Microsoft Research who for the past several years has done incredibly original theoretical work in the understanding of large artificial neural networks. His work currently spans the following five papers:

Tensor Programs I: Wide Feedforward or Recurrent Neural Networks of Any Architecture are Gaussian Processes: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12478](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12478)  
Tensor Programs II: Neural Tangent Kernel for Any Architecture: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14548](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14548)  
Tensor Programs III: Neural Matrix Laws: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10685)  
Tensor Programs IV: Feature Learning in Infinite-Width Neural Networks: [https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/yang21c.html](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/yang21c.html)  
Tensor Programs V: Tuning Large Neural Networks via Zero-Shot Hyperparameter Transfer: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03466](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03466)

In our whiteboard conversation, we get a sample of Greg's work, which goes under the name ""Tensor Programs"". The route chosen to compress Tensor Programs into the scope of a conversational video is to place its main concepts under the umbrella of one larger, central, and time-tested idea: that of taking a large N limit. This occurs most famously in the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, which then play a fundamental role in the branch of mathematics known as Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We review this foundational material and then show how Tensor Programs (TP) generalizes this classical work, offering new proofs of RMT.

We conclude with the applications of Tensor Programs to a (rare!) rigorous theory of neural networks. This includes applications to a rigorous proof for the existence of the Neural Network Gaussian Process and Neural Tangent Kernel for a general class of architectures, the existence of infinite-width feature learning limits, and the muP parameterization enabling hyperparameter transfer from smaller to larger networks.

skjjvm,Holy $#!t: Are popular toxicity models simply profanity detectors? [D],"One of the problems with real world machine learning is that engineers often treat models as pure black boxes to be optimized, ignoring the datasets behind them. I've often worked with ML engineers who can't give you any examples of false positives they want their models to fix!

Perhaps this is okay when your datasets are high-quality and representative of the real world, but they're usually not.

For example, many toxicity and hate speech datasets mistakenly flag texts like ""this is fucking awesome!"" as toxic, even though they're actually quite positive -- because NLP datasets are often labeled by non-fluent speakers who pattern match on profanity. (So is 99% accuracy or 99% precision actually a good thing? Not if your test sets are inaccurate as well!)

Many of the new, massive scale language models use the Perspective API to measure their safety. But we've noticed a number of Perspective API mistakes on texts containing positive profanity, so [I wrote a blog post](https://www.surgehq.ai/blog/are-popular-toxicity-models-simply-profanity-detectors) in an attempt to explain the problem and quantify it.

bl7abw,[R] Study shows that artificial neural networks can be used to drive brain activity.,"MIT neuroscientists have performed the most rigorous testing yet of computational models that mimic the brain’s visual cortex.

Using their current best model of the brain’s visual neural network, the researchers designed a new way to precisely control individual neurons and populations of neurons in the middle of that network. In an animal study, the team then showed that the information gained from the computational model enabled them to create images that strongly activated specific brain neurons of their choosing.

The findings suggest that the current versions of these models are similar enough to the brain that they could be used to control brain states in animals. The study also helps to establish the usefulness of these vision models, which have generated vigorous debate over whether they accurately mimic how the visual cortex works, says James DiCarlo, the head of MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, an investigator in the McGovern Institute for Brain Research and the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines, and the senior author of the study.

c2pfgb,[D] How can you do great AI research when you don't have access to google-scale compute? By being weird. — @togelius,"*Just ran into this interesting [thread](https://twitter.com/togelius/status/1088679404937625600) by [Julian Togelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Togelius), author of several papers and books in the area of A.I. in games.*

[Unrolled Summary](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1088679404937625600.html):

[How can you do great AI research when you don't have access to google-scale compute?](https://twitter.com/togelius/status/1088679404937625600) By being weird.

The big tech companies are obsessed with staying nimble despite being big, and some succeed to some extent. But they can't afford to be as weird as a lone looney professor.

A lone professor with a handful of students and a few computers can never win over DeepMind or FAIR in a straight competition. But we can afford to try methods that make absolutely no sense, or attack problems that nobody wants to solve as they don't look like problems.

To the extent I've done anything useful or worthwhile in my career, it's always been through trying to solve a problem nobody thought of, or trying a method that shouldn't work. Very often the useful/publishable end result was nothing like what I thought I was working towards.

So go on, be weird. Out-weird the giants. Even if they're both nimble and powerful, they cannot be as stupid and ridiculous as you. Because how would that look? To managers, investors, board members, the general public? You can afford to completely disregard such entities.

Now, I'm not saying that there's no value in throwing giant compute resources at some problem, and trying to break a long-standing benchmark. That's all good, I'm happy that there are people that do those things. But I'm happy that I don't have to do it. Because it's a bit boring

And of course the advantage of the big tech companies is not only in having many GPUs. It's also in having large teams of highly competent people working on the project non-stop without having to e.g. teach or go to faculty meetings. Still, you can do it.

Many of the best ideas still come from academia, even though the best results don't.

We are David Silver (/u/David_Silver) and Julian Schrittwieser (/u/JulianSchrittwieser) from [DeepMind] (https://deepmind.com/). We are representing the team that created [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/). 

We are excited to talk to you about the history of AlphaGo, our most recent research on AlphaGo, and the challenge matches against the 18-time world champion [Lee Sedol](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/alphago-korea/) in 2017 and world #1 [Ke Jie](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/alphago-china/) earlier this year. We can even talk about the [movie](https://www.alphagomovie.com/) that’s just been made about AlphaGo : )

We are opening this thread now and will be here at 1800BST/1300EST/1000PST on 19 October to answer your questions.

EDIT 1: We are excited to announce that we have just published our second Nature [paper](http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature24270) on AlphaGo. This paper describes our latest program, [AlphaGo Zero] (https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch), which learns to play Go without any human data, handcrafted features, or human intervention. Unlike other versions of AlphaGo, which trained on thousands of human amateur and professional games, Zero learns Go simply by playing games against itself, starting from completely random play - ultimately resulting in our strongest player to date. We’re excited about this result and happy to answer questions about this as well.

EDIT 2: We are [here](https://twitter.com/DeepMindAI/status/921058369829527552), ready to answer your questions!

juogvw,[R] Undergrad Thesis on Manifold Learning,"Hi all,

I finished undergrad this past spring and just got a chance to tidy up my undergraduate thesis. It's about manifold learning, which is not discussed too often here, so I thought some people might enjoy it.

g5ali0,[D] Schmidhuber: Critique of Honda Prize for Dr. Hinton,"Schmidhuber [tweeted](https://twitter.com/SchmidhuberAI/status/1252494225880596480) about his latest [blog post](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html): *“At least in science, the facts will always win in the end. As long as the facts have not yet won, it is not yet the end. No fancy award can ever change that.”*

*His post starts like this:*

**We must stop crediting the wrong people for inventions made by others. Instead let's heed the recent call in the journal _Nature_: ""Let 2020 be the year in which we value those who ensure that science is self-correcting.""** [[SV20]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#SV20)

Like those who know me can testify, finding and citing original sources of scientific and technological innovations is important to me, whether they are mine or other people's [[DL1]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#DL1) [[DL2]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#DL2) [[NASC1-9]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#NASC1). The present page is offered as a resource for members of the machine learning community who share this inclination. I am also inviting others to contribute additional relevant references. By grounding research in its true intellectual foundations, I do not mean to diminish important contributions made by others. My goal is to encourage the entire community to be more scholarly in its efforts and to recognize the foundational work that sometimes gets lost in the frenzy of modern AI and machine learning.

Here I will focus on six false and/or misleading attributions of credit to Dr. Hinton in the press release of the 2019 Honda Prize [[HON]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#HON). For each claim there is a paragraph ([I](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#I), [II](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#II), [III](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#III), [IV](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#IV), [V](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#V), [VI](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#VI)) labeled by ""**Honda**,"" followed by a critical comment labeled ""**Critique.**"" Reusing material and references from recent blog posts [[MIR]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#MIR) [[DEC]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#DEC), I'll point out that Hinton's most visible publications failed to mention essential relevant prior work - this may explain some of Honda's misattributions.

**Executive Summary.** Hinton has made significant contributions to artificial neural networks (NNs) and deep learning, but Honda credits him for fundamental inventions of others whom he did not cite. Science must not allow corporate PR to distort the academic record. **[Sec. I:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#I)** Modern [backpropagation](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/who-invented-backpropagation.html) was created by Linnainmaa (1970), not by Rumelhart & Hinton & Williams (1985). Ivakhnenko's deep feedforward nets (since 1965) learned internal representations long before Hinton's shallower ones (1980s). **[Sec. II:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#II)** Hinton's unsupervised pre-training for deep NNs in the 2000s was conceptually a rehash of [my unsupervised pre-training for deep NNs](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/firstdeeplearner.html) in 1991\. And it was irrelevant for the [deep learning revolution of the early 2010s](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html) which was mostly based on supervised learning - twice my lab [spearheaded the shift from unsupervised pre-training to pure supervised learning](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019) (1991-95 and 2006-11). **[Sec. III:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#III)** The first superior end-to-end neural speech recognition was based on two methods from my lab: [LSTM](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204) (1990s-2005) and CTC (2006). Hinton et al. (2012) still used an old hybrid approach of the 1980s and 90s, and did not compare it to the revolutionary CTC-LSTM ([which was soon on most smartphones](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html)). **[Sec. IV:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#IV)** Our group at IDSIA had [superior award-winning computer vision through deep learning (2011)](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/computer-vision-contests-won-by-gpu-cnns.html) before Hinton's (2012). **[Sec. V:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#V)** Hanson (1990) had a variant of ""dropout"" long before Hinton (2012). **[Sec. VI:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#VI)** In the [2010s](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html), most major AI-based services across the world [(speech recognition, language translation, etc.) on billions of devices](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html) were mostly based on our deep learning techniques, not on Hinton's. Repeatedly, Hinton [omitted](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#conclusion) references to fundamental prior art (Sec. [I](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#I) & [II](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#II) & [III](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#III) & [V](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#V)) [[DL1]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#DL1) [[DL2]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#DL2) [[DLC]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#DLC) [[MIR]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#MIR) [[R4-R8]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#R4).

I am proud to share with you the first version of a project on a geometric unification of deep learning that has kept us busy throughout COVID times (having started in February 2020).

We release our 150-page ""proto-book"" on geometric deep learning (with Michael Bronstein, Joan Bruna and Taco Cohen)! We have currently released the arXiv preprint and a companion blog post at:

[https://geometricdeeplearning.com/](https://geometricdeeplearning.com/)

Through the lens of symmetries, invariances and group theory, we attempt to distill ""all you need to build the neural architectures that are all you need"". All the 'usual suspects' such as CNNs, GNNs, Transformers and LSTMs are covered, while also including recent exciting developments such as Spherical CNNs, SO(3)-Transformers and Gauge Equivariant Mesh CNNs.

Hence, we believe that our work can be a useful way to navigate the increasingly challenging landscape of deep learning architectures. We hope you will find it a worthwhile perspective!

I also recently gave a virtual talk at FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg (the birthplace of Felix Klein's ""Erlangen Program"", which was one of our key guiding principles!) where I attempt to distill the key concepts of the text within a \~1 hour slot:

auvj3q,"[R] AdaBound: An optimizer that trains as fast as Adam and as good as SGD (ICLR 2019), with A PyTorch Implementation","Hi! I am an undergrad doing research in the field of ML/DL/NLP. This is my first time to write a post on Reddit. :D

We developed a new optimizer called **AdaBound**, hoping to achieve a faster training speed as well as better performance on unseen data. Our paper, *Adaptive Gradient Methods with Dynamic Bound of Learning Rate*, has been accepted by ICLR 2019 and we just updated the camera ready version on open review.

I am very excited that a PyTorch implementation of AdaBound is publicly available now, and a PyPI package has been released as well. You may install and try AdaBound easily via `pip` or directly copying & pasting. I also wrote a post to introduce this lovely new optimizer.

&#x200B;

Here're some quick links:

**Website:** [https://www.luolc.com/publications/adabound/](https://www.luolc.com/publications/adabound/)

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/Luolc/AdaBound](https://github.com/Luolc/AdaBound)

**Open Review:** [https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkg3g2R9FX](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkg3g2R9FX)

**Abstract:**

Adaptive optimization methods such as AdaGrad, RMSprop and Adam have been proposed to achieve a rapid training process with an element-wise scaling term on learning rates. Though prevailing, they are observed to generalize poorly compared with SGD or even fail to converge due to unstable and extreme learning rates. Recent work has put forward some algorithms such as AMSGrad to tackle this issue but they failed to achieve considerable improvement over existing methods. In our paper, we demonstrate that extreme learning rates can lead to poor performance. We provide new variants of Adam and AMSGrad, called AdaBound and AMSBound respectively, which employ dynamic bounds on learning rates to achieve a gradual and smooth transition from adaptive methods to SGD and give a theoretical proof of convergence. We further conduct experiments on various popular tasks and models, which is often insufficient in previous work. Experimental results show that new variants can eliminate the generalization gap between adaptive methods and SGD and maintain higher learning speed early in training at the same time. Moreover, they can bring significant improvement over their prototypes, especially on complex deep networks. The implementation of the algorithm can be found at [https://github.com/Luolc/AdaBound](https://github.com/Luolc/AdaBound).

**Some updates:**

Thanks a lot for all your comments! Here're some updates to address some of the common concerns.

About tasks, datasets, models. As suggested by many of you, as well as the reviewers, it would be great to test AdaBound on more datasets, and larger datasets, with more models. But very unfortunately I only have limited computational resources. It is almost impossible for me to conduct experiments on some large benchmarks like ImageNet. :( It would be so nice of you if you may have a try with AdaBound and tell me its shortcomings or bugs! It would be important for improvements on AdaBound as well as possible further work.

I believe there is no silver bullet in the field of CS. It doesn't mean that you will be free from tuning hyperparameters once using AdaBound. The performance of a model depends on so many things including the task, the model structure, the distribution of data, and etc. You still need to decide what hyperparameters to use based on your specific situation, but you may probably use much less time than before!

&#x200B;

It was my first time doing research on optimization methods. As this is a project by a literally freshman to this field and an undergrad, I believe AdaBound is well required further improvements. I will try my best to make it better. Thanks again for all your constructive comments! It would be of great help to me. :D",402,56,Luolc,2019-02-26 05:22:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/auvj3q/r_adabound_an_optimizer_that_trains_as_fast_as/,0,MachineLearning

c1vxoc,"[D] 17 interviews (4 phone screens, 13 onsite, 5 different companies), all but two of the interviewes asked this one basic classification question, and I still don't know the answer...","I've been trying to get back into a more ML/science based role (currently I'm more on the tech business side). Within my own specific domain, I know all of the major algorithms and have been able to shine in that particular topic (times series and regression models). When it comes to generic data science, I have been able to handle myself quite well on most fronts (probability questions, conceptual questions, what is the central mean theorem? can you explain MLE? etc...) .

One topic kept coming up though, with 15 out of the 17 interviewers, across all 5 companies (including two of the biggest names in tech) asking this exact question:

**Suppose you have a binary classifier (logistic regression, neural net, etc...), how do you handle imbalanced data sets in production?**

I don't know :-( . I know that you need to be careful with which metric you use to evaluate your model, that you should look at precision and recall or the ROC, instead of just accuracy. And that your sampling strategies should change to better reflect each class. But all of this is during training.

Once in production, I know that you face a catch-22 situation:

* If you *don't skew* your training data, then you don't have enough data from the sparse class for the classifier to learn something, and it will just learn to always predict the dense class.
* If you *do skew* your data, then now you're facing a situation where the distribution of the training data and the distribution of the production data are completely different, so your model won't predict well (at least my understanding is that different distributions in test and in prod is always a recipe for disaster).

Is my assessment of the dilemma correct? And how do you solve it?

Why is this question so popular (FWIW - none of these companies were doing medical or security applications....)

&#x200B;

Some follow up questions and/or hints that were given (but I still couldn't really answer the question in a satisfactory way):

* If this is the case, but only you noticed that your binary classifier is not performing well only after you have already deployed it in production and had been scoring it for a few weeks, what do you do? (My answer, go back to training, and either re-evaluate which features you want to use, or find more data to train on) , second follow from the same person: What if I told you that you are stuck with the same model and couldn't get any more data, what do you do then (I answered: l1 or l2 regularization? but these are applicable to any data set, they aren't specific to imbalanced data. Fiddle with the K in your K-fold CV? that wouldn't work either -- by this point I felt like I was being Kobayashi Marued...)
* Can you adjust your classifier after training, but before deploying it, so that it is adjusted to the original distribution, not the skewed (downsampled or upsampled) distribution you used during training? (Drew a blank - as far as I know, any adjustment to the model based on knowledge prior to deployment constitutes training in one form or the other....)

With regards to the second question, I did come across \[this thread and the blog that it linked to\]([https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/403244/89649](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/403244/89649)) . It applies only to logistic regression, not any other binary classifier as far as I can tell . What about other classifiers? (Or is it that logistic regression is the only applicable algorithm in the imbalanced case?)",398,108,SpockTriesToReturn,2019-06-18 01:19:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/c1vxoc/d_17_interviews_4_phone_screens_13_onsite_5/,0,MachineLearning

1bf85rj,[D] What are some well-written ML codebases to refer to get inspiration on good ML software design?,"What publicly available ml projects would you refer to as examples of good software design for ML? I’m referring to aspects like how the abstract model/data set/metric classes defined, how easy is it to add a new functionality based on that design, and about overall experience of using them.

For example, I believe scikit-learn is an example of good design. The fit/preditct paradigm is extremely easy to understand even for a newcomer. 

Most modern projects seem to be using a config-driven dynamic initialization of objects and I’d also appreciate resources on good practices around such design. Some examples for such design are huggingface and hydra-based experimentation code bases.

The links to posts where the authors explain their design philosophy would also be helpful. For example, huggingface has a “Repeat Yourself” philosophy as opposed to “Don’t Repeat Yourself”.

It will also help to list the libraries to avoid.

txqkin,"[Project] Learning to Play ""Settlers of Catan"" With Deep RL - Writeup and Code","Hi all,

I just wanted to share a project I've been working on for the past year - using deep RL to learn to play the board game Settlers of Catan.

I expect everyone is aware of the results that DeepMind/OpenAI have got recently on Go, DOTA 2, Starcraft 2 etc, but I was motivated to see how much progress could be made with existing RL techniques on a reasonably complex game - but with access to significantly less computational resources.

Whilst I didn't end up with an agent that performs at a super-human level, there was clear learning progress and the results were quite interesting. I decided to do a full write-up of the project [here](https://settlers-rl.github.io/), which I figured could be useful for anyone else who is interested in trying to apply DRL to a new, complicated environment. I also open-sourced all the code [here](https://github.com/henrycharlesworth/settlers_of_catan_RL) for anyone interested.

erx7d2,[R] Over-sampling done wrong leads to overly optimistic result.,"While preterm birth is still the leading cause of death among young children, we noticed a large number (24!) of studies reporting near-perfect results on a public dataset when estimating the risk of preterm birth for a patient. At first, we were unable to reproduce their results until we noticed that a large number of these studies had one thing in common: they used over-sampling to mitigate the imbalance in the data (more term than preterm cases). After discovering this, we were able to reproduce their results, but only when making a fundamental methodological flaw: applying over-sampling before partitioning data into training and testing set. In this work, we highlight why applying over-sampling before data partitioning results in overly optimistic results and reproduce the results of all studies we suspected of making that mistake. Moreover, we study the impact of over-sampling, when applied correctly.

abj1mc,[D] Notes on why deep neural networks are able to generalize well,"Hello,

I spent a good part of today reading on why deep neural networks are able to generalize well.  Based on my reading, I have made some notes. I'm new to this, so I'd appreciate if I can have community members' comments / discussion on the same. In particular, I'd love to know if I got something wrong or if someone is aware of a significant result that I missed.

Here are my notes:

1/ First major insight was that the minibatch of data for gradient descent actually helps in generalization on unseen data.   **Gradients of minibatch of data that are specific about that batch cancel over multiple runs and what remains is gradients that are generally applicable**.

2/ It is known that [neural networks are universal function approximators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem). That is, given a function they can approximate that function with arbitrary accuracy.  But now I think that's not an interesting result (of approximating a function). Even a database can do that. What's interesting is that they give good answers on *unseen* data.

3/ It is a mystery how that happens but probably the answer lies in not as much about neural networks but the types of datasets we have in the natural world and what problems we use neural networks for.

4/ Natural world is full of information, one 1000x1000 px photo has 1 million bits but when we see it, we either see it as a cat or a dog.  Effectively, we ""throw out"" a lot of information to do whatever we want to do. To classify a photo, our brain convert a log(2^(1) million) bits into log(2^(1)) bit and the task of a neural network is to find the mapping that ""forgets"" or ""throws"" all the information irrelevant to the task while only retaining info that's useful to us.

5/ Since this log(2^(1) million) to log(2^(1)) is a many-to-one function, neural networks might be a really good model for approximating these functions.  **Different layers might be throwing away irrelevant information while keeping only the relevant info**.

6/ This is suggested by two papers/videos I saw today.  One was on information bottleneck: [https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-theory-cracks-open-the-black-box-of-deep-learning-20170921/](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-theory-cracks-open-the-black-box-of-deep-learning-20170921/)

7/ The other one is how **errors introduced in early layers tend to vanish in higher layers**: [http://www.offconvex.org/2018/02/17/generalization2/](http://www.offconvex.org/2018/02/17/generalization2/)

8/ In effect, **neural networks are lossy compression algorithms** that compress inputs as much as they can while retaining as much info as possible about the task at hand (classification, prediction)  This helps networks generalize as data-specific noise gets ignored in deep networks.

9/ Okay, so we know what deep networks \*might\* be doing but the question is how training via gradient descent is able to find the right set of parameters that do this compression.  Given the millions of weights and biases, it seems the problem is of finding the needle in the haystack.

10/ I honestly don't know and research community also (probably) doesn't know. But there are hints.  One is related to the earlier suggestion of many-to-one mapping of input to output in real-world tasks. This means that t**here may be more than 1 set of parameters that do the job equally well**

11/ So stochastic gradient descent might not be finding the ""perfect"" set of parameters but it may not matter. **The problem we want to solve through neural networks may get solved by many sets of params** and SGD may find one of them.

12/ In fact, empirically the landscape of **loss function for neural networks on ""natural"" problems (of image classification, etc.) seems to have a ""flat"" minima.**

&#x200B;

[Image via: https://www.offconvex.org/2018/02/17/generalization2/](https://i.redd.it/91ysxtolzt721.png)

13/ So the *same* function we're seeking might be parameterized by many parameters.   On top of this, what helps is that **in a big deep network there exist many, many subnetworks. And, just by pure luck, one or more of them might be better positioned to seek that landscape via SGD.** This is explored in the lottery hypothesis: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635)

14/ I understand how the width of the network may help in exploring what information to throw (by setting weights to zero) and what information to use, but I'm not sure the role of depth.  **My hunch says the utility of depth is related to how stochastic gradient descent works. Do you agree?**

15/ Perhaps, just perhaps, different layers (depth) helps SGD reduce loss in steps by focusing on few dimensions at once v/s if it is just one very wide layer, SGD has too many dimensions to seek at once.  But I don't really know.

16/ What's fascinating to me is the how easily researchers drop neural networks as function approximators anywhere and everywhere. This just makes it more worthwhile to study the dynamics of deep networks.  If you want to dive in, here's a great tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r07Sofj\_puQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r07Sofj_puQ)

That's all! Did I miss anything? Did I go wrong somewhere? I'd appreciate any inputs that can help build us a better intuition of what might be happening under the hood.

PS: I tweeted about this as well, but I don't have many friends on Twitter who may provide a perspective on my notes or catch my errors.  That's why I started a discussion on this subreddit.

194ap95,Most things we have today in AI will be a irrelevant in 6 months [P],"This is the unfortunate situation when you build ""thin wrapper"" products on the top of foundational models.

Last year we built a custom Stable Diffusion pipeline for our client, did a lot of experimentation over 2 months, figured out custom solutions for edge cases and shipped a pipeline that could convert group photos to Christmas gift cards.

Today, Alibaba launched ReplaceAnything and I could build the same thing with maybe 10% quality drop in a minute (!) as our team spent couple of weeks on just a few months ago.

The progress in this space is insane.

Fortunately, this was just ""one of those small fun things"" that we built for our client.

I just can't imagine the stress of building one of these companies especially if you raised venture.

The clock is ticking and with every day you have less and less technical moat.

* 67 of the competitions took place on the top 5 platforms (Kaggle, AIcrowd, Tianchi, DrivenData, and Zindi), but there were 8 competitions which took place on platforms which only ran one competition last year.
* Almost all winners used Python - 1 used C++!
* 77% of Deep Learning solutions used PyTorch (up from 72% last year)
* All winning computer vision solutions we found used CNNs
* All winning NLP solutions we found used Transformers

\[Update, since people seem quite interested in this\]: there's loads more analysis I'd love to do on this data, but I'm just funding this out of my own pocket right now as I find it interesting and I'm using it to promote my (also free) website. If anyone has any suggestions for ways to fund this, I'll try to do something more in-depth next year. I'd love to see for example:

1. How big a difference was there between #1 and #2 solutions? Can we attribute the 'edge' of the winner to anything in particular in a meaningful way? (data augmentation, feature selection, model architecture, compute power, ...)
2. How representative is the public leaderboard? How much do people tend to overfit to the public subset of the test set? Are there particular techniques that work well to avoid this?
3. Who are the top teams in the industry?
4. Which competitions give the best ""return on effort""? (i.e. least competition for a given size prize pool)
5. Which particular techniques work well for particular types of competitions?

6rj9r4,[D] How do you read math-heavy machine learning papers?,"Some machine learning papers are pretty math-heavy. It takes me much more time to read a math-heavy paper than the other more common variety of deep learning papers. Also, would be nice to know what math background people have here. Which books did you find very useful to understand ML papers? Which books can I read to improve my ""stamina"" for reading math-heavy machine learning papers?

EDIT: Wow, this question seems popular. To clarify a bit, I do assume that that the reader has a decent math background, linear algebra, probability, calculus, at the basic level. Also, I know that most papers can be understood just by reading the English and ignoring the math, or just looking at the non-math sections which describe the algorithm. That works well, however, I'm interested in the math. I want to be able to understand and appreciate the math which sometimes is very relevant to the idea. This would correspond to understanding Borel hierarchies and Lebesgue measures. I can handle the case when the author is just being a showoff.

lrroom,[N] OpenAI has released the encoder and decoder for the discrete VAE used for DALL-E,"Background info: [OpenAI's DALL-E blog post](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/).

Repo: [https://github.com/openai/DALL-E](https://github.com/openai/DALL-E).

[Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/openai/DALL-E/blob/master/notebooks/usage.ipynb).

Add this line as the first line of the Colab notebook:

    !pip install git+https://github.com/openai/DALL-E.git

I'm not an expert in this area, but nonetheless I'll try to provide more context about what was released today. This is one of the components of DALL-E, but not the entirety of DALL-E. This is the DALL-E component that generates 256x256 pixel images from a [32x32 grid of numbers, each with 8192 possible values](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/kr63ot/r_new_paper_from_openai_dalle_creating_images/gi8wy8q/) (and vice-versa). What we don't have for DALL-E is the language model that takes as input text (and optionally part of an image) and returns as output the 32x32 grid of numbers.

I have 3 non-cherry-picked examples of image decoding/encoding using the Colab notebook at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MediaSynthesis/comments/lroigk/for_developers_openai_has_released_the_encoder/).

1armmng,[D] OpenAI Sora Video Gen -- How??,">Introducing Sora, our text-to-video model. Sora can generate videos up to a minute long while maintaining visual quality and adherence to the user’s prompt.




https://openai.com/sora

Research Notes
Sora is a diffusion model, which generates a video by starting off with one that looks like static noise and gradually transforms it by removing the noise over many steps.

Sora is capable of generating entire videos all at once or extending generated videos to make them longer. By giving the model foresight of many frames at a time, we’ve solved a challenging problem of making sure a subject stays the same even when it goes out of view temporarily.

Similar to GPT models, Sora uses a transformer architecture, unlocking superior scaling performance.

We represent videos and images as collections of smaller units of data called patches, each of which is akin to a token in GPT. By unifying how we represent data, we can train diffusion transformers on a wider range of visual data than was possible before, spanning different durations, resolutions and aspect ratios.

Sora builds on past research in DALL·E and GPT models. It uses the recaptioning technique from DALL·E 3, which involves generating highly descriptive captions for the visual training data. As a result, the model is able to follow the user’s text instructions in the generated video more faithfully.

In addition to being able to generate a video solely from text instructions, the model is able to take an existing still image and generate a video from it, animating the image’s contents with accuracy and attention to small detail. The model can also take an existing video and extend it or fill in missing frames. Learn more in our technical paper (coming later today).

Sora serves as a foundation for models that can understand and simulate the real world, a capability we believe will be an important milestone for achieving AGI.

pffoo8,[R] Multiplying Matrices Without Multiplying,"Hey all, thought this was an interesting paper on speeding up matrix multiplication!

>**Abstract:** Multiplying matrices is among the most fundamental and compute-intensive operations in machine learning. Consequently, there has been significant work on efficiently approximating matrix multiplies. We introduce a learning-based algorithm for this task that greatly outperforms existing methods. Experiments using hundreds of matrices from diverse domains show that it often runs 100× faster than exact matrix products and 10× faster than current approximate methods. In the common case that one matrix is known ahead of time, our method also has the interesting property that it requires zero multiply-adds. These results suggest that a mixture of hashing, averaging, and byte shuffling−the core operations of our method−could be a more promising building block for machine learning than the sparsified, factorized, and/or scalar quantized matrix products that have recently been the focus of substantial research and hardware investment.

j7aeyf,[P] I made an entirely fake resume generator. It has 10 models that generate different pieces of a resume.,"Hey guys, I'm new to ML but have been attempting to learn it during 2020 (Melbourne, Australia, we have been locked down for half a year)

I work on a project called [jsonresume.org](https://jsonresume.org), through which people write their resume in JSON, and most people also publicly host their resumes.

So we have available several thousand resumes to train on.

A standard resume.json will look like this;

    {
      ""basics"": {
        ""name"": ""John Doe"",
        ""label"": ""Programmer"",
        ""picture"": """",
        ""email"": ""john@gmail.com"",
        ""phone"": ""(912) 555-4321"",
        ""website"": ""http://johndoe.com"",
        ""summary"": ""A summary of John Doe..."",

So I began training models (they are shit) on each of those properties across the thousands of resumes. The main properties focused on can be found here -> [https://github.com/jsonresume/jsonresume-fake/tree/master/models](https://github.com/jsonresume/jsonresume-fake/tree/master/models)

Once I had those I was able to generate a fake resume.

Lo and behold -> [https://fake.jsonresume.org](https://fake.jsonresume.org)

All the models, scripts (to train, sample and generate) can be found in this repository -> [https://github.com/jsonresume/jsonresume-fake](https://github.com/jsonresume/jsonresume-fake)

gqdq2o,[D] Uber AI's Contributions,"As we learned last week, [Uber decided to wind down their AI lab](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/gm80x2/n_uber_to_cut_3000_jobs_including_rollbacks_on_ai/). Uber AI started as an acquisition of Geometric Intelligence, which was founded in October 2014 by three professors: Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist from NYU, also well-known as an author; Zoubin Ghahramani, a Cambridge professor of machine learning and Fellow of the Royal Society; Kenneth Stanley, a professor of computer science at the University of Central Florida and pioneer in evolutionary approaches to machine learning; and Douglas Bemis, a recent NYU graduate with a PhD in neurolinguistics. Other team members included Noah Goodman (Stanford), Jeff Clune (Wyoming) and Jason Yosinski (a recent graduate of Cornell).

I would like to use this post as an opportunity for redditors to mention any work done by Uber AI that they feel deserves recognition. Any work mentioned here ([https://eng.uber.com/research/?\_sft\_category=research-ai-ml](https://eng.uber.com/research/?_sft_category=research-ai-ml)) or here ([https://eng.uber.com/category/articles/ai/](https://eng.uber.com/category/articles/ai/)) is fair game.

* [The surprising creativity of digital evolution: A collection of anecdotes from the evolutionary computation and artificial life research communities](https://eng.uber.com/research/the-surprising-creativity-of-digital-evolution-a-collection-of-anecdotes-from-the-evolutionary-computation-and-artificial-life-research-communities/)

* [Kenneth Stanley's Lecture on On Creativity, Objectives, and Open-Endedness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2I4E_UINRo)
* Also, here's a summary by an outside source: [https://analyticsindiamag.com/uber-ai-labs-layoffs/](https://analyticsindiamag.com/uber-ai-labs-layoffs/) (I found it amusing that they quoted u/hardmaru quoting me).

One reason why I find this research fascinating is encapsulated in the quote below:

""Right now, the majority of the field is engaged in what I call the manual path to AI. In the first phase, which we are in now, everyone is manually creating different building blocks of intelligence. The assumption is that at some point in the future our community will finish discovering all the necessary building blocks and then will take on the Herculean task of putting all of these building blocks together into an extremely complex thinking machine. That might work, and some part of our community should pursue that path. However, I think a faster path that is more likely to be successful is to rely on learning and computation: the idea is to create an algorithm that itself designs all the building blocks and figures out how to put them together, which I call an AI-generating algorithm. Such an algorithm starts out not containing much intelligence at all and bootstraps itself up in complexity to ultimately produce extremely powerful general AI. That’s what happened on Earth.  The simple Darwinian algorithm coupled with a planet-sized computer ultimately produced the human brain. I think that it’s really interesting and exciting to think about how we can create algorithms that mimic what happened to Earth in that way. Of course, we also have to figure out how to make them work so they do not require a planet-sized computer."" - [Jeff Clune](https://eng.uber.com/jeff-clune-interview/)

MIT, like most universities, has many courses on machine learning (6.036, 6.867, and many others). Those classes teach techniques to produce effective models for a given dataset, and the classes focus heavily on the mathematical details of models rather than practical applications. However, in real-world applications of ML, the dataset is not fixed, and focusing on improving the data often gives better results than improving the model. We’ve personally seen this time and time again in our applied ML work as well as our research.

Data-Centric AI (DCAI) is an emerging science that studies techniques to improve datasets in a systematic/algorithmic way — given that this topic wasn’t covered in the standard curriculum, we (a group of PhD candidates and grads) thought that we should put together a new class! We taught this intensive 2-week course in January over MIT’s IAP term, and we’ve just published all the course material, including lecture videos, lecture notes, hands-on lab assignments, and lab solutions, in hopes that people outside the MIT community would find these resources useful.

We’d be happy to answer any questions related to the class or DCAI in general, and we’d love to hear any feedback on how we can improve the course material.

i4z7on,[N] ArXiv’s 1.7M+ Research Papers Now Available on Kaggle,"To help make world’s largest free scientific paper repository even more accessible, arXiv [announced yesterday](https://twitter.com/arxiv/status/1291007439953973249) that all of its research papers are now available on Kaggle.

168wc1o,I pretrained 16 language models from scratch with different tokenizers to benchmark the difference. Here are the results. [Research],"I'm the author of [TokenMonster](https://github.com/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster), a free open-source tokenizer and vocabulary builder. I've posted on here a few times as the project has evolved, and each time I'm asked ""have you tested it on a language model?"".

Well here it is. I spent $8,000 from my own pocket, and 2 months, pretraining from scratch, finetuning and evaluating 16 language models. 12 small sized models of 91 - 124M parameters, and 4 medium sized models of 354M parameters.

[Here is the link to the full analysis.](https://github.com/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster/blob/main/benchmark/pretrain.md)

## Summary of Findings

* Comparable (50256-strict-nocapcode) TokenMonster vocabularies perform better than both GPT-2 Tokenizer and tiktoken p50k\_base on all metrics.
* Optimal vocabulary size is 32,000.
* Simpler vocabularies converge faster but do not necessarily produce better results when converged.
* Higher compression (more chr/tok) does not negatively affect model quality alone.
* Vocabularies with multiple words per token have a 5% negative impact on SMLQA (Ground Truth) benchmark, but a 13% better chr/tok compression.
* Capcode takes longer to learn, but once the model has converged, does not appear to affect SMLQA (Ground Truth) or SQuAD (Data Extraction) benchmarks significantly in either direction.
* Validation loss and F1 score are both meaningless metrics when comparing different tokenizers.
* Flaws and complications in the tokenizer affect the model's ability to learn facts more than they affect its linguistic capability.

**Interesting Excerpts:**

\[...\] Because the pattern of linguistic fluency is more obvious to correct during backpropagation vs. linguistic facts (which are extremely nuanced and context-dependent), this means that any improvement made in the efficiency of the tokenizer, that has in itself nothing to do with truthfulness, has the knock-on effect of directly translating into improved fidelity of information, as seen in the SMLQA (Ground Truth) benchmark. To put it simply: a better tokenizer = a more truthful model, but not necessarily a more fluent model. To say that the other way around: a model with an inefficient tokenizer still learns to write eloquently but the additional cost of fluency has a downstream effect of reducing the trustfulness of the model.

\[...\] Validation Loss is not an effective metric for comparing models that utilize different tokenizers. Validation Loss is very strongly correlated (0.97 Pearson correlation) with the compression ratio (average number of characters per token) associated with a given tokenizer. To compare Loss values between tokenizers, it may be more effective to measure loss relative to characters rather than tokens, as the Loss value is directly proportionate to the average number of characters per token.

\[...\] The F1 Score is not a suitable metric for evaluating language models that are trained to generate variable-length responses (which signal completion with an end-of-text token). This is due to the F1 formula's heavy penalization of longer text sequences. F1 Score favors models that produce shorter responses.

**How Stability AI’s Founder Tanked His Billion-Dollar Startup**

*Mar 29, 2024*

Stability AI founder Emad Mostaque took the stage last week at the Terranea Resort in Palos Verdes, California to roaring applause and an introduction from an AI-generated Aristotle who announced him as “a modern Prometheus” with “the astuteness of Athena and the vision of Daedalus.”

“Under his stewardship, AI becomes the Herculean force poised to vanquish the twin serpents of illness and ailment and extend the olive branch of longevity,” the faux Aristotle proclaimed.

“I think that’s the best intro I’ve ever had,” Mostaque said.

But behind Mostaque's hagiographic introduction lay a grim and fast metastasizing truth. Stability, once one of AI’s buzziest startups, was floundering. It had been running out of money for months and Mostaque had been unable to secure enough additional funding. It had defaulted on payments to Amazon whose cloud service undergirded Stability’s core offerings. The star research team behind its flagship text-to-image generator Stable Diffusion had tendered their resignations just three days before — as Forbes would first report — and other senior leaders had issued him an ultimatum: resign, or we walk too.

Still, onstage before a massive audience of peers and acolytes, Mostaque talked a big game. “AI is jet planes for the mind,” he opined. “AI is our collective intelligence. It's the human Colossus.” He claimed a new, faster version of the Stable Diffusion image generator released earlier this month could generate “200 cats with hats per second.” But later, when he was asked about Stability’s financial model, Mostaque fumbled. “I can’t say that publicly,” he replied. “But it’s going well. We’re ahead of forecast.”

Four days later, Mostaque stepped down as CEO of Stability, as Forbes first reported. In a post to X, the service formerly known as Twitter, he claimed he’d voluntarily abdicated his role to decentralize “the concentration of power in AI.” But sources told Forbes that was hardly the case. Behind the scenes, Mostaque had fought to maintain his position and control despite mounting pressure externally and internally to step down. Company documents and interviews with 32 current and former employees, investors, collaborators and industry observers suggest his abrupt exit was the result of poor business judgment and wild overspending that undermined confidence in his vision and leadership, and ultimately kneecapped the company.

Mostaque, through his attorneys, declined to comment on record on a detailed list of questions about the reporting in this story. But in an email to Forbes earlier this week he broadly disputed the allegations. “Nobody tells you how hard it is to be a CEO and there are better CEOs than me to scale a business,” he said in a statement. “I am not sure anyone else would have been able to build and grow the research team to build the best and most widely used models out there and I’m very proud of the team there. I look forward to moving onto the next problem to handle and hopefully move the needle.”

In an emailed statement, Christian Laforte and Shan Shan Wong, the interim co-CEOs who replaced Mostaque, said, ""the company remains focused on commercializing its world leading technology” and providing it “to partners across the creative industries.""

After starting Stability in 2019, Mostaque built the company into an early AI juggernaut by seizing upon a promising research project that would become Stable Diffusion and funding it into a business reality. The ease with which the software generated detailed images from the simplest text prompts immediately captivated the public: 10 million people used it on any given day, the company told Forbes in early 2023. For some true believers, Mostaque was a crucial advocate for open-source AI development in a space dominated by the closed systems of OpenAI, Google and Anthropic.

But his startup’s rise to one of the buzziest in generative AI was in part built on a series of exaggerations and misleading claims, as Forbes first reported last year (Mostaque disputed some points at the time). And they continued after he raised $100 million at a $1 billion valuation just days after launching Stable Diffusion in 2022. His failure to deliver on an array of grand promises, like building bespoke AI models for nation states, and his decision to pour tens of millions into research without a sustainable business plan, eroded Stability’s foundations and jeopardized its future.

""He was just giving shit away,” one former employee told Forbes. “That man legitimately wanted to transform the world. He actually wanted to train AI models for kids in Malawi. Was it practical? Absolutely not.""

By October 2023, Stability would have less than $4 million left in the bank, according to an internal memo prepared for a board meeting and reviewed by Forbes. And mounting debt, including months of overdue Amazon Web Services payments, had already left it in the red. To avoid legal penalties for skipping Americans staff’s payroll, the document explained, the London-based startup was considering delaying tax payments to the U.K. government.

It was Stability’s armada of GPUs, the wildly powerful and equally expensive chips undergirding AI, that were so taxing the company’s finances. Hosted by AWS, they had long been one of Mostaque’s bragging points; he often touted them as one of the world’s 10 largest supercomputers. They were responsible for helping Stability’s researchers build and maintain one of the top AI image generators, as well as break important new ground on generative audio, video and 3D models. “Undeniably, Stability has continued to ship a lot of models,” said one former employee. “They may not have profited off of it, but the broader ecosystem benefitted in a huge, huge way.”

But the costs associated with so much compute were now threatening to sink the company. According to an internal October financial forecast seen by Forbes, Stability was on track to spend $99 million on compute in 2023. It noted as well that Stability was “underpaying AWS bills for July (by $1M)” and “not planning to pay AWS at the end of October for August usage ($7M).” Then there were the September and October bills, plus $1 million owed to Google Cloud and $600,000 to GPU cloud data center CoreWeave. (Amazon, Google and CoreWeave declined to comment.)

With an additional $54 million allocated to wages and operating expenses, Stability’s total projected costs for 2023 were $153 million. But according to its October financial report, its projected revenue for the calendar year was just $11 million. Stability was on track to lose more money per month than it made in an entire year.

The company’s dire financial position had thoroughly soured Stability’s current investors, including Coatue, which had invested tens of millions in the company during its $101 million funding round in 2022. In the middle of 2023, Mostaque agreed to an independent audit after Coatue raised a series of concerns, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. The outcome of the investigation is unclear. Coatue declined to comment.

Within a week of an early October board meeting where Mostaque shared that financial forecast, Lightspeed Venture Partners, another major investor, sent a letter to the board urging them to sell the company. The distressing numbers had “severely undermined” the firm’s confidence in Mostaque’s ability to lead the company.

“In particular, we are surprised and deeply concerned by a cash position just now disclosed to us that is inconsistent with prior discussions on this topic,” Lightspeed’s general counsel Brett Nissenberg wrote in the letter, a copy of which was viewed by Forbes. “Lightspeed believes that the company is not likely financeable on terms that would assure the company’s long term sound financial position.” (Lightspeed declined a request for comment.)

The calls for a sale led Stability to quietly begin looking for a buyer. Bloomberg reported in November that Stability approached AI startups Cohere and Jasper to gauge their interest. Stability denied this, and Jasper CEO Timothy Young did the same when reached for comment by Forbes. A Cohere representative declined to comment.

But one prominent AI company confirmed that Mostaque’s representatives had reached out to them to test the waters. Those talks did not advance because “the numbers didn’t add up,” this person, who declined to be named due to the confidential nature of the talks, told Forbes. Stability also tried to court Samsung as a buyer, going so far as to redecorate its office in advance of a planned meeting with the Korean electronics giant. (Samsung said that it invested in Stability in 2023 and that it does not comment on M&A discussions.)

Coatue had been calling for Mostaque’s resignation for months, according to a source with direct knowledge. But it and other investors were unable to oust him because he was the company’s majority shareholder. When they tried a different tact by rallying other investors to offer him a juicy equity package to resign, Mostaque refused, said two sources. By October, Coatue and Lightspeed had had enough. Coatue left the board and Lightspeed resigned its observer seat.

“Emad infuriated our initial investors so much it’s just making it impossible for us to raise more money under acceptable terms,” one current Stability executive told Forbes.

The early months of 2024 saw Stability’s already precarious position eroding further still. Employees were quietly laid off. Three people in a position to know estimated that at least 10% of staff were cut. And cash reserves continued to dwindle. Mostaque mentioned a lifeline at the October board meeting: $95 million in tentative funding from new investors, pending due diligence. But in the end, only a fraction of it was wired, two sources say, much of it from Intel, which Forbes has learned invested $20 million, a fraction of what was reported. (Intel did not return a request for comment by publication time.)

Two hours after Forbes broke the news of Mostaque’s plans to step down as CEO, Stability issued a press release confirming his resignation. Chief operating officer Wong and chief technology officer Laforte have taken over in the interim. Mostaque, who said on X that he still owns a majority of the company, also stepped down from the board, which has now initiated a search for a permanent CEO. There is a lot of work to be done to turn things around, and very little time in which to do it. Said the current Stability executive, “There’s still a possibility of a turnaround story, but the odds drop by the day.”

In July of 2023, Mostaque still thought he could pull it off. Halfway through the month, he shared a fundraising plan with his lieutenants. It was wildly optimistic, detailing the raise of $500 million in cash and another $750 million in computing facilities from marquee investors like Nvidia, Google, Intel and the World Bank (Nvidia and Google declined comment. Intel did not respond. The World Bank said it did not invest in Stability). In a Slack message reviewed by Forbes, Mostaque said Google was “willing to move fast” and the round was “likely to be oversubscribed.”

It wasn’t. Three people with direct knowledge of these fundraising efforts told Forbes that while there was some interest in Stability, talks often stalled when it came time to disclose financials. Two of them noted that earlier in the year, Mostaque had simply stopped engaging with VCs who asked for numbers. Only one firm invested around that time: actor Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures, which invested $35 million in the form of a convertible SAFE note during the second quarter, according to an internal document. (Sound Ventures did not respond to a request for comment.)

And though he’d managed to score a meeting with Nvidia and its CEO Jensen Huang, it ended in disaster, according to two sources. “Under Jensen's microscopic questions, Emad just fell apart,” a source in position to know told Forbes. Huang quickly concluded Stability wasn’t ready for an investment from Nvidia, the sources said. Mostaque told Forbes in an email that he had not met with Huang since 2022, except to say “hello and what’s up a few times after.” His July 2023 message references a plan to raise $150 million from Nvidia. (Nvidia declined to comment.)

After a June Forbes investigation citing more than 30 sources revealed Mostaque’s history of misleading claims, Mostaque struggled to raise funding, a Stability investor told Forbes. (Mostaque disputed the story at the time and called it ""coordinated lies"" in his email this week to Forbes). Increasingly, investors scrutinized his assertions and pressed for data. And Young, now the CEO of Jasper, turned down a verbal offer to be Stability’s president after reading the article, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. The collapse of the talks aggravated the board and other executives, who had hoped Young would compensate for the sales and business management skills that Mostaque lacked, according to four people in a position to know. (Young declined to comment.)

When Stability’s senior leadership convened in London for the CogX conference in September, the financing had still not closed. There, a group of executives confronted Mostaque asking questions about the company’s cash position and runway, according to three people with direct knowledge of the incident. They did not get the clarity they’d hoped for.

By October, Mostaque had reduced his fundraising target by more than 80%.

The months that followed saw a steady drumbeat of departures — general counsel Adam Avrunin, vice presidents Mike Melnicki, Ed Newton-Rex and Joe Penna, chief people officer Ozden Onder — culminating in the demoralizing March exit of Stable Diffusion’s primary developers Robin Rombach, Andreas Blattmann, Patrick Esser and Dominik Lorenz. Rombach, who led the team, had been angling to leave for months, two sources said, first threatening to resign last summer because of the fundraising failures. Others left over concerns about cash flow, as well as liabilities — including what four people described as Mostaque’s lax approach to ensuring that Stability products could not be used to produce child sexual abuse imagery.

“Stability AI is committed to preventing the misuse of AI and prohibits the use of our image models and services for unlawful activity, including attempts to edit or create CSAM,” Ella Irwin, senior vice president of integrity, said in a statement.

Newton-Rex told Forbes he resigned because he disagreed with Stability’s position that training AI on copyrighted work without consent is fair use. Melnicki and Penna declined to comment. Avrunin and Onder could not be reached for comment. None of the researchers responded to requests for comment.

The Stable Diffusion researchers’ departure as a cohort says a lot about the state of Stability AI. The company’s researchers were widely viewed as its crown jewels, their work subsidized with a firehose of pricey compute power that was even extended to people outside the company. Martino Russi, an artificial intelligence researcher, told Forbes that though he was never formally employed by Stability, the company provided him a “staggering” amount of compute between January and April 2023 to play around with developing an AI video generator that Stability might someday use. “It was Candy Land or Coney Island,” said Russi, who estimates that his experiment, which was ultimately shelved, cost the company $2.5 million.

Stable Diffusion was simultaneously Stability’s marquee product and its existential cash crisis. One current employee described it to Forbes as “a giant vacuum that absorbed everything: money, compute, people.” While the software was widely used, with Mostaque claiming downloads reaching into the hundreds of millions, Stability struggled to translate that wild success into revenue. Mostaque knew it could be done — peers at Databricks, Elastic and MongoDB had all turned a free product into a lucrative business — he just couldn’t figure out how.

His first attempt was Stability’s API, which allowed paying customers to integrate Stable Diffusion into their own products. In early 2023, a handful of small companies, like art generator app NightCafe and presentation software startup Tome, signed on, according to four people with knowledge of the deals. But Stability’s poor account management services soured many, and in a matter of months NightCafe and Tome canceled their contracts, three people said. NightCafe founder Angus Russell told Forbes that his company switched to a competitor which “offered much cheaper inference costs and a broader service.” Tome did not respond to a request for comment.

Meanwhile, Mostaque’s efforts to court larger companies like Samsung and Snapchat were failing, according to five people familiar with the effort. Canva, which was already one of the heaviest users of open-sourced Stable Diffusion, had multiple discussions with Stability, which was angling for a contract it hoped would generate several millions in annual revenue. But the deal never materialized, four sources said.

“These three companies wanted and needed us,” one former employee told Forbes. “They would have been the perfect customers.” (Samsung, Snap and Canva declined to comment.)

“It’s not that there was not an appetite to pay Stability — there were tons of companies that would have that wanted to,” the former employee said. “There was a huge opportunity and demand, but just a resistance to execution.”

Mostaque’s other big idea was to provide governments with bespoke national AI models that would invigorate their economies and citizenry. “Emad envisions a world where AI through 100 national models serves not as a tool of the few, but as a benefactor to all promising to confront great adversaries, cancer, autism, and the sands of time itself,” the AI avatar of Aristotle said in his intro at the conference.

Mostaque told several prospective customers that he could deliver such models within 60 days — an untenable timeline, according to two people in position to know. Stability attempted to develop a model for the Singaporean government over the protestation of employees who questioned its technical feasibility, three sources familiar with the effort told Forbes. But it couldn’t pull it off and Singapore never became a customer. (The government of Singapore confirmed it did not enter into a deal with Stability, but declined to answer additional questions.)

As Stability careened from one new business idea to another, resources were abruptly reallocated and researchers reassigned. The whiplash shifts in a largely siloed organization demoralized and infuriated employees. “There were ‘urgent’ things, ‘urgent urgent’ things and ‘most urgent,’” one former employee complained. “None of these things seem important if everything is important.”

Another former Stability executive was far more pointed in their assessment. “Emad is the most disorganized leader I have ever worked with in my career,” this person told Forbes. “He has no vision, and changes directions every week, often based on what he sees on Twitter.”

In a video interview posted shortly before this story was published, Mostaque explained his leadership style: “I'm particularly great at taking creatives, developers, researchers, others, and achieving their full potential in designing systems. But I should not be dealing with, you know, HR and operations and business development and other elements. There are far better people than me to do that.”

By December 2023, Stability had partially abandoned its open-source roots and announced that any commercial use of Stable Diffusion would cost customers at least $20 per month (non-commercial and research use of Stable Diffusion would remain free).

But privately, Stability was considering a potentially more lucrative source of revenue: reselling the compute it was leasing from providers like AWS, according to six people familiar with the effort. Though it was essentially GPU arbitrage, Stability framed the strategy to investors as a “managed services” offering. Its damning October financial report projected optimistically that such an offering would bring in $139 million in 2024 — 98% of its revenue. Multiple employees at the time told Forbes they feared reselling compute, even if the company called it “managed services,” would violate the terms of Stability’s contract with AWS. Amazon declined to comment. “The line internally was that we are not reselling compute,” one former employee said. “This was some of the dirtiest feeling stuff.”

Stability also discussed reselling a cluster of Nvidia A100 chips, leased via CoreWeave, to the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, three sources said. “It was under the guise of managed services, but there wasn’t any management happening,” one of these people told Forbes. Andreessen Horowitz and CoreWeave declined to comment.

Stability did not respond to questions about if it plans to continue this strategy now that Mostaque is out of the picture. Regardless, interim co-CEOs Wong and Laforte are on a tight timeline to clean up his mess. Board chairman Jim O’Shaughnessy said in a statement that he was confident the pair “will adeptly steer the company forward in developing and commercializing industry-leading generative AI products.” But burn continues to far outpace revenue. The Financial Times reported Friday that the company made $5.4 million of revenue in February, against $8 million in costs. Several sources said there are ongoing concerns about making payroll for the roughly 150 remaining employees. Leadership roles have gone vacant for months amid the disarray, leaving the company increasingly directionless.

Meanwhile, a potentially catastrophic legal threat looms over the company: A trio of copyright infringement lawsuits brought by Getty Images and a group of artists in the U.S. and U.K., who claim Stability illegally used their art and photography to train the AI models powering Stable Diffusion. A London-based court has already rejected the company’s bid to throw out one of the lawsuits on the basis that none of its researchers were based in the U.K. And Stability’s claim that Getty’s Delaware lawsuit should be blocked because it's a U.K.-based company was rejected. (Stability did not respond to questions about the litigation.)

AI-related copyright litigation “could go on for years,” according to Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University. He told Forbes that though plaintiffs suing AI firms face an uphill battle overcoming the existing legal precedent on copyright infringement, the quantity of arguments available to make are virtually inexhaustible. “Like in military theory, if there’s a gap in your lines, that’s where the enemy pours through — if any one of those arguments succeeds, it could completely change the generative AI environment,” he said. “In some sense, generative AI as an industry has to win everything.”

Stability, which had more than $100 million in the bank just a year and a half ago, is in a deep hole. Not only does it need more funding, it needs a viable business model — or a buyer with the vision and chops to make it successful in a fast-moving and highly competitive sector.

At an all hands meeting this past Monday, Stability’s new leaders detailed a path forward. One point of emphasis: a plan to better manage resources and expenses, according to one person in attendance. It’s a start, but Mostaque’s meddling has left them with little runway to execute. His resignation, though, has given some employees hope. “A few people are 100% going to reconsider leaving after today,” said one current employee. “And the weird gloomy aura of hearing Emad talking nonsense for an hour is gone.”

Shortly before Mostaque resigned, one current Stability executive told Forbes that they were optimistic his departure could make Stability appealing enough to receive a small investment or sale to a friendly party.

“There are companies that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars that have much less intrinsic value than Stability,” the person said. “A white knight may still appear.”",379,222,milaworld,2024-03-30 05:13:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1br9vxr/n_how_stability_ais_founder_tanked_his/,0,MachineLearning

iy8njt,[D] Snapchat Anime Filter,"If you don't know what I'm talking about, take a look [here](https://comicbook.com/anime/news/snapchat-anime-filter-viral-manga-2020/#10).

As soon as I saw how stable the generation of the filter was, I started experimenting with it and trying to figure out how they did it.

My current belief is as follows. They manually hooked up the features from their face detection/recognition algo into an anime face GAN.  So you can think of as those sliders that control age/hair colour/skin colour on the face generation website but hooked up to features from facial recognition.

SC definitely has singled out which algo features correspond to which facial features because they use hair colour/length in other filters.

This approach leads to the more generic anime faces seen in the filter, but is way more stable than something like https://selfie2anime.com/ that does image-to-image conversion.

Aside from that, the filter just does a simple posterisation and overlays the face in the right spot.

1aisp4m,"[P] Chess-GPT, 1000x smaller than GPT-4, plays 1500 Elo chess. We can visualize its internal board state, and it accurately estimates the Elo rating of the players in a game."," gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct's Elo rating of 1800 is chess seemed magical. But it's not! A 100-1000x smaller parameter LLM given a few million games of chess will learn to play at ELO 1500.

This model is only trained to predict the next character in PGN strings (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 …) and is never explicitly given the state of the board or the rules of chess. Despite this, in order to better predict the next character, it learns to compute the state of the board at any point of the game, and learns a diverse set of rules, including check, checkmate, castling, en passant, promotion, pinned pieces, etc. In addition, to better predict the next character it also learns to estimate latent variables such as the Elo rating of the players in the game.

We can visualize the internal board state of the model as it's predicting the next character. For example, in this heatmap, we have the ground truth white pawn location on the left, a binary probe output in the middle, and a gradient of probe confidence on the right. We can see the model is extremely confident that no white pawns are on either back rank.

114hphp,[N] Google is increasing the price of every Colab Pro tier by 10X! Pro is 95 Euro and Pro+ is 433 Euro per month! Without notifying users!,"(Edit: This is definitely an error, not a change in pricing model, so no need for alarm. This has been confirmed by the lead product owner of colab)

Without any announcement (that i could find) google has increased the pricing per month of all its Colab Pro tiers, Pro is now 95 Euro and Pro+ is 433 Euro. I paid 9.99 Euro for the Pro tier last month... and all source i can find also refer to the 9.99 pricing as late as September last year. I have also checked that this is not a ""per year"" subscription price, it is in fact per month.

I looked at the VM that Colab Pro gives me and did the calculation for a similar VM in google cloud (4 vCPUs, 15GB RAM and a T4 GPU) running 24/7 for a month (Google calculates it as 730  hours). 

It costs around 290 Euro, less than the Colab Pro+ subscription... 

The 100 credits gotten from the Colab Pro subscription would only last around 50 hours on the same machine! 

And the 500 credits from Colab Pro+ would get 250 hours on that machine, a third of the time you get from using Google Cloud, at over 100 euro more....

This is a blatant ripoff, and i will certainly cancel my subscription right now if they don't change it back. It should be said that i do not know if this is also happening in other regions, but i just wanted to warn my fellow machine learning peeps before you unknowingly burn 100 bucks on a service that used to cost 10...

og48q2,[D] AI ethics research is unethical,"I have been observing AI/ML ethics research and discussions for over a year now and I have come to the conclusion that most work conducted in this area is deeply unethical.

All entities, let it be companies, institutions, and individuals, are subject to inherent **conflict-of-interests** that render any discussion meaningless.

AI/ML ethics does not generate any profits, making funding source for research or even ethics policies scarce. As a result, there are only a handful of entities working on this domain, which in turn have full control over how the entire field is moving. For instance, the ethics PC of NeurIPS 2020 was a single person (a British man) employed by DeepMind, making him/DM the ultimate arbiter of truth on AI ethics.

AI/ML ethics discussions are centered on domestic problems of the US. For instance, computer vision is becoming dominated by Chinese researchers (just look at this year's CVPR papers), whose approach to ethical values completely differ from the first. However, their views (and those of people from many other demographic groups) are not reflected by any AI/ML ethics rulings.

Finally, the way Timnit Gebru was treated by Google before and after she was kicked out is just unbearable for me. First of all, her paper is not a big deal, her claims are valid and do not threaten Google in any way. The way Google overreacted and even [published a counter paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10350v1.pdf) reveals that the conflict-of-interest I mentioned above runs much much deeper than I previously thought.

Nowadays when we see an AI/ML ethics paper funded by a company, we have to assume it went through several layers of filtering and censoring, putting it on a trustworthiness level on par with CCP propaganda. On top of that, even for papers without any company funding, we have to assume that a paper only resembles the views of a very tiny subset of the global population, because as I wrote, most demographical groups do not have access to funding for this topic and are therefore disregarded.

**TL;DL** an AI/ML ethics paper either reflects a company's interest or the beliefs of a very tiny subset of the earth's population

We also provide a step-by-step guide to [reproduce the results](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/examples/aws/statsforecast.html).

### Results

**Amazon Forecast:**

* achieved 1.617 in error (measured in wRMSSE, the official evaluation metric used in the competition),
* took 4.1 hours to run,
* and cost 803.53 USD.

An **ensemble of statistical methods** trained on a c5d.24xlarge  EC2 instance:

* achieved 0.669 in error (wRMSSE),
* took 14.5 minutes to run,
* and cost only 1.2 USD.

For this data set, we show, therefore, that:

* Amazon Forecast is 60% less accurate and 669 times more expensive than running an open-source alternative in a simple cloud server.
* Classical methods outperform Machine Learning methods in terms of speed, accuracy, and cost.

Although using StatsForecast requires some basic knowledge of Python and cloud computing, the results are better for this dataset.

12hluz1,[R] Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior - Joon Sung Park et al Stanford University 2023,"Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442)

Twitter:  [https://twitter.com/nonmayorpete/status/1645355224029356032?s=20](https://twitter.com/nonmayorpete/status/1645355224029356032?s=20) 

Abstract:

>Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.

umq908,"[R] RWKV-v2-RNN : A parallelizable RNN with transformer-level LM performance, and without using attention","Hi guys. I am an independent researcher and you might know me (BlinkDL) if you are in the EleutherAI discord.

I have built a RNN with transformer-level performance, without using attention. Moreover it supports both sequential & parallel mode in inference and training. So it's combining the best of RNN and transformer - great performance, fast inference, saves VRAM, fast training, ""infinite"" ctx\_len, and free sentence embedding.

[https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM)

I am training a L24-D1024 RWKV-v2-RNN LM (430M params) on the Pile with very promising results:

https://preview.redd.it/xqtkadp5pf191.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fd2f98978dea01e07ded77ed6b5e57b9b7645eb

**All of the trained models will be open-source.** Inference is very fast (only matrix-vector multiplications, no matrix-matrix multiplications) even on CPUs, and **I believe you can run a 1B params RWKV-v2-RNN with reasonable speed on your phone.**

It is inspired by Apple's AFT ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14103](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14103)) with a number of my own tricks, such as:

* RNNify it (via a particular nice form of w\_{t, t\^\\prime}), and use my CUDA kernel to speedup training ([https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-CUDA](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-CUDA))
* Token-shift ([https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM#token-shift-time-shift-mixing](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM#token-shift-time-shift-mixing))
* SmallInitEmb ([https://github.com/BlinkDL/SmallInitEmb](https://github.com/BlinkDL/SmallInitEmb)) which helps the embedding quality, and stabilizes Post-LN (which is what I am using).

I also transferred some time-related parameters from a small model to a large model, to speed up the convergence. Basically the model learns to focus more on short-distance interactions in early layers, and long-distance interactions in later layers.

iap6yo,[Discussion] PyTorch favors Intel against AMD's rising?,"PyTorch packages (both pypi and conda packages) require the Intel MKL library. As you know, Intel MKL uses a slow code path on non-Intel CPUs such as AMD CPUs. There was the MKL\_DEBUG\_CPU\_TYPE=5 workaround to make Intel MKL use a faster code path on AMD CPUs, but it has been disabled since Intel MKL version 2020.1.

PyTorch relies on Intel MKL for BLAS and other features such as FFT computation. Because pypi and conda packages require Intel MKL, the only solution is to build PyTorch from source with a different BLAS library. However, it looks like this isn't really pain-free (e.g. see  [https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/32407](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/32407)).

Moreover, if you look at issues like [https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/37746](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/37746) or  [https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/38412](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/38412), it seems like they basically don't care about this problem.

Since PyTorch packages are slow by default on AMD CPUs and building PyTorch from source with a different BLAS library is also problematic, it seems like PyTorch is effectively protecting Intel CPUs from the ""ryzing"" of AMD's CPUs.

Abstract:

Despite much progress in training AI systems to imitate human language, building agents that use language to communicate intentionally with humans in interactive environments remains a major challenge. We introduce Cicero, the first AI agent to achieve human-level performance in *Diplomacy*, a strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that emphasizes natural language negotiation and tactical coordination between seven players. Cicero integrates a language model with planning and reinforcement learning algorithms by inferring players' beliefs and intentions from its conversations and generating dialogue in pursuit of its plans. Across 40 games of an anonymous online *Diplomacy* league, Cicero achieved more than double the average score of the human players and ranked in the top 10% of participants who played more than one game.

ydqmjp,"[P] Up to 12X faster GPU inference on Bert, T5 and other transformers with OpenAI Triton kernels","We are releasing [Kernl](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/) under Apache 2 license, a library to make PyTorch models inference significantly faster. With 1 line of code we applied the optimizations and made Bert up to 12X faster than Hugging Face baseline. T5 is also covered in this first release (> 6X speed up generation and we are still halfway in the optimizations!). This has been possible because we wrote custom GPU kernels with the new OpenAI programming language Triton and leveraged TorchDynamo.

**Project link**: [https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/)

**E2E demo notebooks**: [XNLI classification](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/blob/main/tutorial/bert%20e2e.ipynb), [T5 generation](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/blob/main/tutorial/t5%20e2e.ipynb)

[Benchmarks ran on a 3090 RTX GPU, 12 cores Intel CPU, more info below](https://preview.redd.it/mlo3wvn0d3w91.png?width=2738&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b9dce736ee4c0e371b54b9ef796310f9728660d)

On long sequence length inputs, [Kernl](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/) is most of the time the fastest inference engine, and close to Nvidia TensorRT on shortest ones. Keep in mind that Bert is one of the most optimized models out there and most of the tools listed above are very mature.

What is interesting is not that [Kernl](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/) is the fastest engine (or not), but that the code of the kernels is short and easy to understand and modify. We have even added a Triton debugger and a tool (based on Fx) to ease kernel replacement so there is no need to modify PyTorch model source code.

Staying in the comfort of PyTorch / Python maintains dynamic behaviors, debugging and iteration speed. Teams designing/training a transformer model (even custom) can take care of the deployment without relying on advanced GPU knowledge (eg. CUDA programming, dedicated inference engine API, etc.).

Recently released models relying on slightly modified transformer architectures are rarely accelerated in traditional inference engines, we need to wait months to years for someone (usually inference engine maintainers) to write required custom CUDA kernels. Because here custom kernels are written in OpenAI Triton language, **anyone without CUDA experience** can easily modify them: OpenAI Triton API is simple and close to Numpy one. Kernels source code is significantly shorter than equivalent implementation in CUDA (< 200 LoC per kernel). Basic knowledge of how GPU works is enough. We are also releasing a few tutorials we initially wrote for onboarding colleagues on the project. We hope you will find them useful: [https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/tree/main/tutorial](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/tree/main/tutorial). In particular, there is:

* Tiled matmul, the GPU way to perform matmul: [https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/blob/main/tutorial/1%20-%20tiled%20matmul.ipynb](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/blob/main/tutorial/1%20-%20tiled%20matmul.ipynb)
* Simple explanation of what Flash attention is and how it works, a fused attention making long sequences much faster: [https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/blob/main/tutorial/4%20-%20flash%20attention.ipynb](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/blob/main/tutorial/4%20-%20flash%20attention.ipynb)

And best of the best, because we stay in the PyTorch / Python ecosystem, we plan in our roadmap to also enable **training** with those custom kernels. In particular [Flash attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention) kernel should bring a 2-4X speed up and the support of very long sequences on single GPU (paper authors went as far as 16K tokens instead of traditional 512 or 2048 limits)! See below for more info.

**IMPORTANT**: Benchmarking is a difficult art, we tried to be as fair as possible. Please note that:

* Timings are based on wall-clock times and we show speedup over baseline as they are easier to compare between input shapes,
* When we need to choose between speed and output precision, we always choose precision
* HF baseline, CUDA graphs, Inductor and [Kernl](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/) are in mixed precision, AITemplate, ONNX Runtime, DeepSpeed and TensorRT have their weights converted to FP16.
* Accumulation is done in FP32 for AITemplate and [Kernl](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/). TensorRT is likely doing it in FP16.
* CUDA graphs is enabled for all engines except baseline, Nvfuser and ONNX Runtime which [has a limited support of it](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/12977#issuecomment-1258406358).
* For [Kernl](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/) and AITemplate, fast GELU has been manually disabled (TensorRT is likely using Fast GELU).
* AITemplate measures are to be taken with a grain of salt, it [doesn’t manage attention mask](https://github.com/facebookincubator/AITemplate/issues/46#issuecomment-1279975463) which means 1/ batch inference can’t be used in most scenarios (no padding support), 2/ it misses few operations on a kernel that can be compute-bounded (depends of sequence length), said otherwise it may make it slower to support attention mask, in particular on long sequences. AITemplate attention mask support will come in a future release.
* For TensorRT for best perf, we built 3 models, one per batch size. AITemplate will support dynamic shapes in a future release, so we made a model per input shape.
* Inductor is in prototype stage, performances may be improved when released, none of the disabled by default optimizations worked during our tests.

As you can see, CUDA graphs erase all CPU overhead (Python related for instance), sometimes there is no need to rely on C++/Rust to be fast! Fused kernels (in CUDA or Triton) are mostly important for longer input sequence lengths. We are aware that there are still some low hanging fruits to improve [Kernl](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/) performance without sacrificing output precision, it’s just the first release. More info about how it works [here](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl#how).

**Why?**

We work for Lefebvre Sarrut, a leading European legal publisher. Several of our products include transformer models in latency sensitive scenarios (search, content recommendation). So far, ONNX Runtime and TensorRT served us well, and we learned interesting patterns along the way that we shared with the community through an open-source library called [transformer-deploy](https://github.com/ELS-RD/transformer-deploy). However, recent changes in our environment made our needs evolve:

* New teams in the group are deploying transformer models in prod directly with PyTorch. ONNX Runtime poses them too many challenges (like debugging precision issues in fp16). With its inference expert-oriented API, TensorRT was not even an option;
* We are exploring applications of large generative language models in legal industry, and we need easier dynamic behavior support plus more efficient quantization, our creative approaches for that purpose we shared [here on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/uwkpmt/p_what_we_learned_by_making_t5large_2x_faster/) proved to be more fragile than we initially thought;
* New business opportunities if we were able to train models supporting large contexts (>5K tokens)

On a more personal note, I enjoyed much more writing kernels and understanding low level computation of transformers than mastering multiple complicated tools API and their environments. It really changed my intuitions and understanding about how the model works, scales, etc. It’s not just OpenAI Triton, we also did some prototyping on C++ / CUDA / Cutlass and the effect was the same, it’s all about digging to a lower level. And still the effort is IMO quite limited regarding the benefits. If you have some interest in machine learning engineering, you should probably give those tools a try.

**Future?**

Our road map includes the following elements (in no particular order):

* Faster warmup
* Ragged inference (no computation lost in padding)
* Training support (with long sequences support)
* Multi GPU (multiple parallelization schemas support)
* Quantization (PTQ)
* New batch of Cutlass kernels tests
* Improve hardware support (>= Ampere for now)
* More tuto

Regarding training, if you want to help, we have written an issue with all the required pointers, it should be very doable: [https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/issues/93](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/issues/93)

On top of speed, one of the main benefits is the support of very long sequences (16K tokens without changing attention formula) as it’s based on [Flash Attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention).

Also, note that future version of PyTorch will include [Inductor](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/torchinductor-a-pytorch-native-compiler-with-define-by-run-ir-and-symbolic-shapes/747). It means that all PyTorch users will have the option to compile to Triton to get around [1.7X faster training](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/torchinductor-update-3-e2e-model-training-with-torchdynamo-inductor-gets-1-67x-2-1x-speedup/793).

12ok5b6,[D] As a developer the current rate of ML progress doesn't make any sense to me,"As you know, at the moment we have multiple giant announcements every single week. On top of that there seem to be hundreds, if not thousands of methods popping up everywhere that significantly improve upon last week's methods. As a software developer with over 10 years of experience, I have to say - this doesn't make any sense to me. At all.

The typical development lifecycle in every company I've worked for goes like this:

* Someone has an idea or commission, meetings are scheduled to talk about feasibility
* Multiple months of planning, requirements engineering, building tools and learning to use them
* When development actually starts, it takes multiple months for a usable version

But when I take a look at the progress in ML, it seems to go like this:

* Paper gets released. A week later everyone is already an expert on the topic. They have 100% understood it, implemented the method, become proficient at using it and identified the issues
* A few days later a completely new idea that improves upon the paper has already been implemented, tested, and an entire paper has been written and released

How does this make sense to any of you? 99.99% of developers I know would need months to become good enough at using a tool in any professional capacity. And then they would need months to have any idea on how to improve the method they've learned. And then another few weeks to test it. And another few to write a documentation.

Gigantic projects are popping up after like 2 weeks of development time. But they look like something that professional teams would need literal years to implement. How in the world is everyone such a genius now that they can pump out this stuff on a weekly basis? This is not how software development has worked at any point in time.

9p9ccz,[D] ML is losing some of its luster for me. How do you like your ML career?,"Soliciting thoughts on ML careers (in industry or academia), especially in light of machine learning and deep learning hype.

I work as an applied research engineer at a large non-tech company. Over the last few years ML has lost some of its luster in my mind - the hype around deep learning and ML has added a lot of noise into the system, and for someone who cares about doing good science that's been hard for me.

I feel like the effort I put into rigorous and reasoned application of ML is wasted and makes me less competitive - management wants the ""deep learning"" solution and they are satisfied by someone reading a blog post, throwing half-baked training data and Keras model.fit() at the problem and calling it solved. I'm not sure I can do ML in an environment like that, and it's difficult to push back against the seductive hype of ""cheap and easy"" deep learning (ironically a simple random forest would be much easier and often quite effective, but that isn't sexy. I've seen pressure to use neural networks even when something else makes much more sense to use). I love ML and like seeing others learn and be excited about it, but the low barrier to entry makes it easy for people to sell bad modeling to those who don't know any better.

How are you all enjoying your ML career? I'm considering moving away from ML and going back into software engineering, but maybe I just need to switch companies. Perhaps I'm just a curmudgeon or an idealist. Does anyone else have similar thoughts?

(Background: I have a masters in CS with a focus on machine learning. Since graduating a few years ago I've been working in an applied research role doing a 50/50 mix of software engineering and machine learning. I'm not particularly exceptional, but my company doesn't have a deep bench in AI/ML so I've become recognized as a subject-matter expert and could make a career out of researching and applying ML here.)

&#x200B;

EDIT:  This discussion has been great, thanks everyone. I realize that I should have been more explicit about what I meant by 'someone reading a blog post, throwing half-baked training data and Keras model.fit() at the problem and calling it solved' - I have no problem with quick and dirty work that gets the job done, but often what I see is unprincipled and haphazard application of ML in inappropriate ways. For example: not having a train/test set (particularly egregious), no thought given to overfitting or generality of results in production, etc. Between (1) management/customers not having the skillset to evaluate the methods, and (2) the hype around ML and deep learning, it seems to easy for subpar ML to get by if there isn't a clear feedback mechanism to expose poor models. I'm in favor of simple techniques and I definitely don't want to discourage people who are just starting out in ML - if you don't need sophisticated or rigorous methods to achieve good results that's great.",369,125,mltoss,2018-10-18 13:38:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9p9ccz/d_ml_is_losing_some_of_its_luster_for_me_how_do/,0,MachineLearning

While these two groups have many papers in the symposium, there are more than 80 accepted papers in total from many different groups that could have been highlighted. The selection process for papers was double blind, but I can't help but doubt the process for picking who gets a talk. Particularly because 3 out of 6 of the symposium organizers are associated in some way with these labs.

ilvkyi,[D] Nvidia's RTX 3000 series and direct storage for Machine Learning,"At the product announcement this week Nvidia released many new features for their next line of cards.

Many of us train and develop models running on Nvidia cards, and one new feature designed for gaming stood out to me.

The new Nvidia direct storage tech allows the GPU to load texture data directly from the SSD into the VRAM of the card without using the CPU. They indicate this can have massive 100x speed ups for data loading for video game textures etc.

For training large data models, often times loading and offloading data to the VRAM of the card is the biggest bottleneck for AI workloads. Loading training data, models, etc are often the slowest part of the pipeline when switching over from CPU to GPU compute. 

What do you think about this feature? Will it have a big impact on machine learning done locally? Should we buy new 3000 series cards for this feature alone?

Excerpt:

*On 14 June 2022, a science tabloid that published this [article](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/06/24/1054817/yann-lecun-bold-new-vision-future-ai-deep-learning-meta/) (24 June) on LeCun's report “[A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf)” (27 June) sent me a draft of the report (back then still under embargo) and asked for comments. I wrote a review (see below), telling them that this is essentially a rehash of our previous work that LeCun did not mention. My comments, however, fell on deaf ears. Now I am posting my not so enthusiastic remarks here such that the history of our field does not become further corrupted. The images below link to relevant blog posts from the [AI Blog](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/blog.html).*

*I would like to start this by acknowledging that I am not without a conflict of interest here; my seeking to correct the record will naturally seem self-interested. The truth of the matter is that it is. Much of the closely related work pointed to below was done in my lab, and I naturally wish that it be acknowledged, and recognized. Setting my conflict aside, I ask the reader to study the original papers and judge for themselves the scientific content of these remarks, as I seek to set emotions aside and minimize bias so much as I am capable.*

ibrlvt,"[D] How do ML researchers make progress when iteration cost is prohibitively high? (GPT3, Image-GPT, Autopilot, RL, etc.)","Today Andrej Karpathy released code for a minimal gpt implementation ([here](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT)), but what I found most interesting was his notes on the implementations. In particular at the end of the README he noted from the GPT-3 paper:
> GPT-3: 96 layers, 96 heads, with d_model of 12,288 (175B parameters).

> GPT-1-like: 12 layers, 12 heads, d_model 768 (125M)

> We use the same model and architecture as GPT-2, including the modified initialization, pre-normalization, and reversible tokenization described therein

> we use alternating dense and locally banded sparse attention patterns in the layers of the transformer, similar to the Sparse Transformer

> we always have the feedforward layer four times the size of the bottleneck layer, dff = 4 ∗ dmodel

> all models use a context window of nctx = 2048 tokens.

> Adam with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, and eps = 10−8

> All models use weight decay of 0.1 to provide a small amount of regularization. (NOTE: GPT-1 used 0.01 I believe, see above)

> clip the global norm of the gradient at 1.0

> Linear LR warmup over the first 375 million tokens. Then use cosine decay for learning rate down to 10% of its value, over 260 billion tokens.

> gradually increase the batch size linearly from a small value (32k tokens) to the full value over the first 4-12 billion tokens of training, depending on the model size.

> full 2048-sized time context window is always used, with a special END OF DOCUMENT token delimiter

It's baffling to me how they determined this learning rate schedule, in tandem with all of the other specific choices (7 hyperparameters + architecture)

My background is in deep RL research where iteration cost is pretty high (a training run may take several days to a week). Choosing the right hyperparameters is crucial to the success of algorithms, but thankfully, the complexity isn't so high that we can still run hyperparameter searches. In fact, many researchers, me included, observe that we can keep many parameters discovered from ""exhaustive"" search from other problems frozen and reduce the complexity of a search to a few key parameters like learning rate.


On the other hand, given the huge size of GPT-3 and the training costs, it is obvious that OpenAI researchers could not have done a hyperparameter search to get their results (a single training run probably cost millions.) So in this paradigm of absurd iteration cost, how do researchers determine the set of parameters that end up working? Is there interference during the training process (resetting at checkpoints and starting again?) Do you do hyperparameter searches for increasingly larger models and guess at the trend for what works at a larger scale? 

So my question is: how do you iterate when true iteration isn't possible? My own experience as a grad student has been ""intuition"" from working with the models, but I feel increasingly with these large scale successes / fragility of RL that the deep learning community needs a more principled approach to tackling these problems.

This is by no means a serious look into self-driving vehicles, it's just for fun, and so far the latest project has been to make a motorcycle that speeds through traffic, attempting to stay on the road and evading all the other slow drivers. 

We do all of this with basic(ish...) tools and concepts. We're reading the screen by taking screenshots with pywin32, seeing about 20 FPS with the neural network, sending keys with direct input, and then doing some analysis with OpenCV, otherwise also training with a convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 

The goal of the series is more to show you how you can take just about whatever game you want, mapping the screen to inputs, training a neural network, and then letting the network play the game.

xupiia,[P] Launching Deep Lake: the data lake for deep learning applications - https://activeloop.ai/,"**tl;dr - launching Deep Lake - the data lake for deep learning applications**

Hey r/ML,

Davit here from team Activeloop. My team and I have worked for over three years on our product, and we're excited to launch the latest, most performant iteration, Deep Lake.

Deep Lake is the data lake for deep learning applications. It retains all the benefits of a vanilla data lake, with one difference. Deep Lake is optimized to store complex data, such as images, videos, annotations, embeddings, & tabular data, in the form of tensors and rapidly streams the data over the network to (1) our lightning-fast query engine: Tensor Query Language, (2) in-browser visualization engine, and (3) deep learning frameworks without sacrificing GPU utilization.

[YouTube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxsofpSIw3k)

[Detailed Launch post](https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/introducing-deep-lake-the-data-lake-for-deep-learning/)

**Key features**

* A scalable & efficient data storage system that can handle large amounts of complex data in a columnar fashion
* Querying and visualization engine fully supporting multimodal data types (see the video)
* Native integration with TensorFlow & PyTorch and efficient streaming of data to models and back
* Seamless connection with MLOps tools (e.g., [Weight & Biases](https://docs.activeloop.ai/playbooks/training-reproducibility-with-wandb), with more on the roadmap)

**Performance benchmarks - (if you use PyTorch & audio/video/image, use us)**  
In an [independent benchmark of open-source data loaders by the Yale Institute For Network Science](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.13705.pdf), Deep Lake was shown to be superior in various scenarios. For instance, there's only a 13% increase in time compared to loading from a local disk; Deep Lake outperforms all data loaders on networked loading, etc.).

**Example Workflow**

Here's a brief example of a workflow you're able to achieve with Deep Lake:

**Access Data Fast:** You start with CoCo, a fairly big dataset with 91 classes. You can load the COCO dataset in seconds by running:

    import deeplake
    ds = deeplake.load('hub://activeloop/coco-train')

**Visualize:** You can visualize the data either in-browser or within your Colab (with `ds.visualize`).

**Version Control:** Let's say you noticed that sample 30178, is a low-quality image, and you want to remove it:

    ds.pop(30178)
    ds.commit('Deleted index 30178 because the image is low quality.')

You can now revert the change any time, thanks to the git-like dataset version control.

**Query:** Suppose we want to train a model on small cars and trucks because we know our model performs poorly on small objects. In our Query UI, you can run advanced queries with built-in NumPy-like array manipulations, like:

[\(This would return up to 100 samples that contain trucks that are smaller than 50 pixels and up to 100 samples that contain cars that are smaller than 50 pixels\)](https://preview.redd.it/jkgl1vo8hmr91.png?width=1734&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e54d5c11eb7f3e1963e3104241b2dda1f39ff81)

You can then materialize the query result (Dataset View) by copying and re-chunking the data for maximum performance. You can save this query and load this subset via our Python API via

    import deeplake
    ds.load_view('Query_ID', optimize = True, num_workers = 4)

5.  **Materialize & Stream:** Finally, you can create the PyTorch data loader and stream the dataset in real-time while training the model that distinguishes cars from trucks:

    train_loader = ds_view.pytorch(num_workers = 8, shuffle = True, transform = transform_train, tensors = ['images', 'categories', 'boxes'], batch_size = 16, collate_fn = collate_fn)

You can review the rest of the code in this [data lineage playbook](https://docs.activeloop.ai/playbooks/training-with-lineage)!

Deep Lake is fresh off the ""press"", so we would really appreciate your feedback here or in our [community](https://slack.activeloop.ai), a [star on GitHub](https://github.com/activeloopai/deeplake). If you're interested to learn more, you can read the [Deep Lake academic paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10785.pdf) or the [whitepaper](https://deeplake.ai) (that talks more about our vision!).

wgvacf,[D] why is the AI research community so unreliable?,"How many papers I have read that have explicitly mentioned that their dataset and/or code is available for public use but in practice they rarely if ever actually are. Most of the time they don’t have a publicly available link and expect you to mail them, in which case too they reply maybe once for every ten papers. 

It’s one thing to not want to make it open source and it’s another to make the claim that is verifiable false. So often do I want to put a complaint against them but I relent because what if they are the reviewers for my next paper? Of course I don’t want to hurt my chances for future publication. It’s a vicious cycle that doesn’t have a fix and it causes so much irritation and pain.",366,102,fireless-phoenix,2022-08-05 13:18:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/wgvacf/d_why_is_the_ai_research_community_so_unreliable/,0,MachineLearning
ioa9za,[D] PSA: NVIDIA's Tensor-TFLOPS values for their newest GPUs include sparsity,"NVIDIA claims the 3080 has 238 ‘Tensor-TFLOPS’ of performance from their tensor cores, the 3090 has 285, and the 3070 has 163. As usual, these numbers are for 16-bit floating point. In contrast, the 2080 Ti has only 114 TFLOPS of ‘Tensor-TFLOPS’, so you would be forgiven for thinking the 30 series will be much faster at training.

Alas, the values for the 30 series are *TFLOPS-equivalent with sparsity*, not actual TFLOPS. Ampere has support for ‘2:4 structured sparsity’, which accelerates matrix multiplications where half of the values in every block of four are zeroed. This means that the actual number of TFLOPS for the 3080, 3090 and 3070 are 119, 143, and 81.

When Ampere originally launched on the A100, NVIDIA was [very clear](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/data-center/a100/#specifications) about differentiating real TFLOPS from TFLOPS-equivalent with sparsity. It is incredibly disappointing that NVIDIA have been not at all upfront about this with their new GeForce GPUs. This is made worse by the fact that the tensor cores have been cut in half in the GeForce line relative to the A100, so it is easy to get confused into thinking the doubled numbers are correct.

Although hardware sparsity support is a great feature, it obviously only provides benefits when you are training or running inference on a sparsified network. Keep this in mind before rushing to purchase these new GPUs. You might be better off with a heavily-discounted 2080 Ti.",365,72,Veedrac,2020-09-07 16:09:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ioa9za/d_psa_nvidias_tensortflops_values_for_their/,0,MachineLearning

m7tfva,"[D] Thought-detection with AI (honestly, wtf?)","I read [this](https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/13/thought-detection-ai-has-infiltrated-our-last-bastion-of-privacy/) article recently, which made me think quite a bit.

Setting aside that possibly (and hopefully) this might never work outside of laboratory conditions, I think it's important to discuss the implications.

Personally, as a researcher, I find the AI field amazing (setting aside all the hype, bullshit and drama), and I think there's a huge responsibility in our hands to tip the balance between a utopian or dystopian future. For this reason I find this kind of research is extremely disturbing.

To quite from the article:

>... first author of the study, said: “We’re now looking to investigate how  we could use low-cost existing systems, such as Wi-Fi routers, to detect  emotions of a large number of people gathered, for instance in an  office or work environment.” Among other things, this could be useful  for HR departments to assess how new policies introduced in a meeting  are being received, regardless of what the recipients might say. Outside  of an office, police could use this technology to look for emotional  changes in a crowd that might lead to violence.  
>  
>The research team plans to examine public acceptance and ethical concerns around the use of this technology.  
>  
>....

Okey, so here comes the rant:

1. Yet another example of ""let's do something and then see the ethical concerns later"".
2. If your second statement about your research (right after stating that it is possible) is not about how to prevent this from being misused on a large scale, but rather proposing possible ways to apply this to benefit corporations, anti-protest forces and alike, then seriously, just fuck off and apply to a grant in North Korea.
3. They even say that they are actively looking into how this could be used with low-cost existing systems (e.g. Wi-Fi routers, etc.). These devices are in almost every western household, which is supposed to be a safe-space for fuckin everyone. How do you justify your work and call it beneficial for society?
4. There's a new article almost every week about a company or government body violating people's privacy in some way using technology. Yet, some researchers want to find better ways to do it, which shows that their moral compass doesn't work at all or they actively want to push things in the wrong direction. Whichever it is, you should stop what you're doing all together.
5. Of course, I see potential benefits to help people with depression, etc., but there are other ways that doesn't involve dystopian mind-reading technology put in your home or office.

Let me know what you think (or just get a device that reads your mind), I might be missing something obvious here.

Edit: just to make it absolutely clear, this is not a discussion about the technical side of the research, which may or may not be garbage (it's irrelevant here). This is a discussion about the attitude of researchers who don't seem to understand that just because they can do something does not mean that they actually should.

Edit 2: I don't assume bad intentions from the authors, simply questioning how is it acceptable to work on such a sensitive topic without **prior** and **thorough** ethical considerations.",361,149,vakker00,2021-03-18 15:35:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/m7tfva/d_thoughtdetection_with_ai_honestly_wtf/,0,MachineLearning

* it's huge: about 10\^11 neurons and about 10\^14 weights
* it takes 8K Ultra HD video (60 fps) as the input, and generates text as the output (100 bytes per second on average)
* it can do some image recognition and natural language processing, among other things

I have the following experimental setup:

* the network is functioning about 16 hours per day
* I can give it specific inputs and observe the outputs
* I can record the inputs and outputs (already collected several years of it)

hrnsvu,"[D] how obsessed do you need to be to succeed in ML research (PhD, USA if relevant)?","So I was watching an interview where Ian goodfellow said that during a near death experience he had, all he thought about was how he wanted someone to try a list of research ideas he had. He said this confirmed for him that ML research was for him. https://youtu.be/pWAc9B2zJS4 (4:10)

I have nowhere near that level of obsession. I'm worried that this may be a problem, as in maybe I'm not passionate enough about research to do great work in the area.

They can crunch deep learning tasks 1,000 times faster than CPUs.

https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/15/intel-neuromorphic-pohoiki-beach-loihi-chips/

> Even though the whole 5G thing didn't work out, Intel is is still working on hard on its Loihi ""neuromorphic"" deep-learning chips, modeled after the human brain. It unveiled a new system, code-named Pohoiki Beach, made up of 64 Loihi chips and 8 million so-called neurons. It's capable of crunching AI algorithms up to 1,000 faster and 10,000 times more efficiently than regular CPUs for use with autonomous driving, electronic robot skin, prosthetic limbs and more.
> 
> The Loihi chips are installed on a ""Nahuku"" board that contains from 8 to 32 Loihi chips. The Pohoiki Beach system contains multiple Nahuku boards that can be interfaced with Intel's Arria 10 FPGA developer's kit, as shown above.
> 
> Pohoiki Beach will be very good at neural-like tasks including sparse coding, path planning and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). In layman's terms, those are all algorithms used for things like autonomous driving, indoor mapping for robots and efficient sensing systems. For instance, Intel said that the boards are being used to make certain types of prosthetic legs more adaptable, powering object tracking via new, efficient event cameras, giving tactile input to an iCub robot's electronic skin, and even automating a foosball table.
> 
> The Pohoiki system apparently performed just as well as GPU/CPU-based systems, while consuming a lot less power -- something that will be critical for self-contained autonomous vehicles, for instance. "" We benchmarked the Loihi-run network and found it to be equally accurate while consuming 100 times less energy than a widely used CPU-run SLAM method for mobile robots,"" Rutgers' professor Konstantinos Michmizos told Intel.
> 
> Intel said that the system can easily scale up to handle more complex problems and later this year, it plans to release a Pohoiki Beach system that's over ten times larger, with up to 100 million neurons.

mi0wst,[D] Statistical Significance in Deep RL Papers: What is going on?,"I'm an ICML reviewer, and I've been reading author responses.  I'm primarily an RL researcher, and so many of the papers I reviewed used deep networks + RL.  I rejected 3-4 papers because their empirical results relied on 3-5 trials (and the authors did not perform any sort of hypothesis testing/statistical analysis...not that that would have helped with so little data).  One of the author responses said something like, ""well, everyone else does the same thing, and the computational cost is very high"".  It's not an excuse, but they are not wrong on either point.

Why is this seen as acceptable?  In other fields (e.g., a medical journal), manuscripts with 3-5 data points and no statistical analysis would be immediately rejected, and rightfully so (and if the authors responded and said ""well we couldn't afford a larger study"", no one would see that as a legitimate excuse).  However, **none of the other reviewers on these papers are raising these concerns**.  Why am I the only one with these concerns?  **Why are papers like these getting accepted at top conferences, and even winning best paper awards?**  Am I missing something, or is this a deep problem with our field (in which case I should stick firmly with “reject” for these papers)?

[What the network can do in a nutshell.](https://reddit.com/link/e1k092/video/5h95d7fzfv041/player)

I created two tools with this network.

* One that changes facial poses by GUI manipulation:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMQCERkTdO0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMQCERkTdO0)

The second is  [Zhou et al.'s 2016 object rotation by appearance flow paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03557), which I use to rotate the face.

Unlike Open-AI, they have released the complete code for data processing, training, and evaluation.

Detailed writeup: [https://nv-adlr.github.io/MegatronLM](https://nv-adlr.github.io/MegatronLM)

From github:

>Megatron  is a large, powerful transformer. This repo is for ongoing  research on  training large, powerful transformer language models at  scale.  Currently, we support model-parallel, multinode training of [GPT2](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) in mixed precision.Our  codebase is capable of efficiently training a 72-layer, 8.3  Billion  Parameter GPT2 Language model with 8-way model and 64-way data   parallelism across 512 GPUs. We find that bigger language models are   able to surpass current GPT2-1.5B wikitext perplexities in as little as 5   epochs of training.For BERT  training our repository trains BERT Large on 64 V100 GPUs in  3 days. We  achieved a final language modeling perplexity of 3.15 and  SQuAD  F1-score of 90.7.

Their submission is not in the leaderboard of SQuAD, but this exceeds the previous best single model performance (RoBERTa 89.8).

For  language modelling they get zero-shot wikitext perplexity of 17.4 (8.3B  model) better than 18.3 of transformer-xl (257M). However they claim it  as SOTA when GPT-2 itself has 17.48 ppl, and another model has 16.4 ([https://paperswithcode.com/sota/language-modelling-on-wikitext-103](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/language-modelling-on-wikitext-103))

j1xlcm,[D] Factors of successful ML(Ops) after 3+ years of ML in Production,"Recently I was invited to a conference to give a workshop about ""Machine Learning in Production"". Before the hands-on part, my Co-Founder and I talked a bit about the ""success factors"" we've determined for ourselves during the last years of doing production ML. It spawned a cool discussion, and it would be great to hear more opinions from the bigger community of [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning).

The common theme throughout all projects was always the reproducibility of trainings and the transparency of what work is being done throughout the team. Back then we had to spend quite some effort to build enough supportive tech around those issues, but it was definitely worth the efforts.

I've written it out into a more detailed blogpost ([https://blog.maiot.io/12-factors-of-ml-in-production/](https://blog.maiot.io/12-factors-of-ml-in-production/)), but this subreddit is always a great place to get some opinionated discussions going :).

Our key factors for successful and reproducible ""production ML"" are:

**1.** Versioning

* TL;DR: You need to version your code, and you need to version your data.

**2.** Explicit feature dependencies

* TL;DR: Make your feature dependencies explicit in your code.

**3.** Descriptive training and preprocessing

* TL;DR: Write readable code and separate code from the configuration.

**4.** Reproducibility of trainings

* TL;DR: Use pipelines and automation.

**5.** Testing

* TL;DR: Test your code, test your models.

**6.** Drift / Continuous training

* TL;DR: If your data can change run a continuous training pipeline.

**7.** Tracking of results

* TL;DR: Track results via automation.

**8.** Experimentation vs Production models

* TL;DR: Notebooks are not production-ready, so experiment in pipelines early on.

**9.** Training-Serving-Skew

* TL;DR: Correctly embed preprocessing to serving, and make sure you understand up- and downstream of your data.

**10.** Comparability

* TL;DR: Build your pipelines so you can easily compare training results across pipelines.

**11.** Monitoring

* TL;DR: Again: you build it, you run it. Monitoring models in production is a part of data science in production.

**12.** Deployability of Models

* TL;DR: Every training pipeline needs to produce a deployable artifact, not “just” a model.

Do you have other production experience? Are you ""cutting corners"" somewhere to be faster, or have you used/built something more sophisticated?

1bnsuea,[R] Up to 17% of Recent AI Conference Peer Reviews Written by ChatGPT,"A new study has uncovered that a significant fraction of peer reviews for top AI conferences in 2023-2024 likely included substantial AI-generated content from models like ChatGPT.

Using a novel statistical technique, researchers estimated the percentage of text generated by AI in large collections of documents. Analyzing peer reviews, they found:

* 10.6% of ICLR 2024 reviews had significant AI content
* 9.1% for NeurIPS 2023
* 6.5% for CoRL 2023
* 16.9% for EMNLP 2023

In contrast, only 1-2% of pre-ChatGPT reviews from 2022 and earlier were flagged as having substantial AI contribution.

Some key findings:

1. AI-heavy reviews tended to come in close to the deadline
2. Fewer scholarly citations in AI-flavored reviews
3. Reviewers with AI-tinged reviews engaged less in author discussion
4. AI content made reviews more semantically homogeneous
5. Lower reviewer confidence correlated with higher AI estimates

The study, I think, raises some questions for proactive policy development in academia around responsible AI use in research. AI may be eroding the quality and integrity of peer review through these ""shadow"" influences. Open questions include:

* Should AI assistance in peer review be disclosed?
* How should we incentivize good practices despite AI temptations?
* Can we preserve intellectual diversity under AI homogenization?
* Should we rethink credit for hybrid human/AI knowledge work?

Overall, an interesting empirical glimpse into AI's rapidly growing tendrils in the foundations of scientific quality control! I thought the approach of measuring the frequency of certain AI wording ""ticks"" made a lot of sense (some of the adjectives GPT4 uses, for example, are clear tells).

f2pbvz,[Discussion] Workaround for MKL on AMD Ryzen/Threadripper - up to 300% Performance gains,"Hello everyone.

**UPDATE: Intel removed the debug mode starting with MKL 2020.1 or newer. Although MKL 2020.1 and following appear to have improved performance by default on AMD to some extend.**

**This means that:**

**WINDOWS USERS should consider to stay with MKL 2020.0 or older versions for now and apply the workaround described below.**

**However**, **FOR LINUX USERS a new elegant workaround is presented here:**

[https://danieldk.eu/Posts/2020-08-31-MKL-Zen.html](https://danieldk.eu/Posts/2020-08-31-MKL-Zen.html)

Original Post:

This had been floating around [mostly in the Matlab community](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/dxn38s/howto_force_matlab_to_use_a_fast_codepath_on_amd/?sort=new) but I get questions regarding this from PyTorch/NumPy/Anaconda/Tensorflow people constantly since posting it. Hence, I want to share this here as well and raise some awareness. Hope it helps many of you.

**What is it?**

So the new Ryzen 3000 or Threadripper 3000 from AMD [do pretty well](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=3990x-threadripper-linux&num=7).  However, the numerical lib that comes with many of your packages by default is the Intel MKL. The MKL runs notoriously slow on AMD CPUs for some operations. This is because the Intel MKL uses a discriminative CPU Dispatcher that does not use efficient codepath according to SIMD support by the CPU, but based on the result of a vendor string query. If the CPU is from AMD, the MKL does not use SSE3-SSE4 or AVX1/2 extensions but falls back to SSE no matter whether the AMD CPU supports more efficient SIMD extensions like AVX2 or not.

The method provided here enforces AVX2 support by the MKL, independent of the vendor string result and takes less than a minute to apply. If you have an AMD CPU that is based on the Zen/Zen+/Zen2 µArch Ryzen/Threadripper, this will boost your performance tremendously. The Workaround also works on the older Excavator µArch. ***Do not apply it on Intel Systems or AMD CPUS older than Excavator.***

Performance gains are substantial! Depending on the operation and CPU, **you can expect 30%-300%.** For Matlab there are some actual numbers [from a review comparing an i9-10980XE vs a Threadripper 3970x with and without the workaround.](https://www.legitreviews.com/codepath-change-gives-amd-ryzen-cpus-boost-in-mathworks-matlab_215641)

[Comparison AMD CPU running MKL in standard \(orange\) or enforced AVX2 mode \(blue\). Values is time to complete task in seconds. \[lower is better\]](https://preview.redd.it/rw77julfhce51.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3071fccdbf67f720d1eab9b16bc843993f395a)

In fact, reading your particular numbers in the comments would be interesting, so feel encouraged to post them.

**tl;dr:**

**WINDOWS:**

**Solution for Windows (admin rights needed):** To apply the workaround, you should enter  MKL\_DEBUG\_CPU\_TYPE=5 into the ""system environment variables"". This will apply to all instances of the MKL independent of the package using it.

https://preview.redd.it/mnqzvlgrihg41.png?width=981&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c4b4667a3fae6627d9d79407459c781a36eae7

You can do this either by editing the environmental variables as shown above, or by opening a command prompt (CMD) **with admin** **rights** and typing in:

    setx /M MKL_DEBUG_CPU_TYPE 5

Doing this will make the change permanent and available to ALL Programs using the MKL on your system until you delete the entry again from the variables.

**LINUX**:

Simply type in a terminal:

    export MKL_DEBUG_CPU_TYPE=5 

before running your script **from the same instance** of the terminal.

**Permanent solution for Linux:**

    echo 'export MKL_DEBUG_CPU_TYPE=5' >> ~/.profile

will apply the setting profile-wide. [More help on how to permanently set environmental variables under Unix/Linux here.](https://www.serverlab.ca/tutorials/linux/administration-linux/how-to-set-environment-variables-in-linux/)

\----

That's all... as simple as that.

So if you can't or don't want to use a non discriminating numerical lib (basically that is any lib but the MKL) like OpenBlas, you might want to consider setting this variable on your AMD System.

Best of luck with your work and happy training!

g1vku4,[D] Antipatterns in open sourced ML research code,"Hi All. I feel given the topic I have to put out a disclaimer first: I salute all the brave souls trying to get papers out in a PhD environment and then having the courage to open source that code. I have adapted code from a number of such repositories both for my own education/personal projects as well as in production code. You are all amazing and have my deepest respects.

Also your code has issues \*\*runs for cover\*\*

Here's my notes on 5 antipatterns that I have encountered a lot. If you have more to add to the list kindly comment below. If you disagree with any of these let's start a discussion around it.

Thanks.


When writing ML related research code (or any code for that matter) please try to avoid... 

1. Make a monolithic config object that you keep passing through all your functions. Configuration files are good, but if you load them into a dictionary and start mutating them everywhere they turn into a nightmare. (useful to mention
that doing this at the top level is usually not problematic, and can tie to your
CLI as well) 

2. Use argparse, sure, but don't use it like 1. Also let's abolish the ""from args import get_args(); cfg = get_args()"" pattern. There's more straight forward ways to parse arguments from the commandline (e.g. if you use argh it'll naturally get you to structure your code around reusable functions)


3. Please don't let your CLI interface leak into your implementation details ... make a library first, and then expose it as a CLI. This also makes everything a lot more reusable. 

4. Unless there's a good reason to do so (hint, there very rarely is), don't use
files as intra-process-communication. If you are calling a function which saves a file which you then load in the next line of code, something has gone very 
wrong. If this function is from a different repo, consider cloning it, fixing, and then PRing back and use the modified form. Side effects have side effects and at some point they are going to cause a silent bug which is very likely to delay 
your research.

5. In almost all but the most trivial situations (or when you really need to do inference in batches for some reason), making a function that operates on an list of things is worse than making a function that operates on a single item. The latter is a lot more easier to use, compose with other functions, make parallel, etc. If you really end up needing an interface that accepts a list, you can just make a new function that calls the individual function.

Edit: this point caused some confusion. There's always tradeoffs for performance. That's why batched inference/training exists. What I'm trying to point to is more when you have some function X that takes some noticeable amount of time Y to operate on a single item, and it simply runs on this list of items one by one. In these cases, having the interface accept a list rather than a single item is adding unnecessary inflexibility for no gain in performance or expressibility.",355,115,jack-of-some,2020-04-15 16:43:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/g1vku4/d_antipatterns_in_open_sourced_ml_research_code/,1,MachineLearning

c6gs1q,[D] Alan Turing's “Intelligent Machinery” (1948),"Turing wrote a paper titled “[Intelligent Machinery](https://weightagnostic.github.io/papers/turing1948.pdf)” in 1948. This is a highly original work, introducing ideas such as genetic algorithms and neural networks (what he called “[unorganized](http://compucology.net/unorganized) [machines](http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/connectionism/Turing%27s%20neural%20networks.html)”) with learning capabilities, and reinforcement learning. I believe “[Intelligent Machinery](https://weightagnostic.github.io/papers/turing1948.pdf)” is the most detailed treatment of A.I. written before 1950. It was not published during Turing’s lifetime [[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unorganized_machine)].

Rather than giving a detailed summary, I will just quote Turing’s own abstract:

**Abstract** The possible ways in which machinery might be made to show intelligent behaviour are discussed. The analogy with the human brain is used as a guiding principle. It is pointed out that the potentialities of the human intelligence can only be realised if suitable education is provided. The investigation mainly centres round an analogous teaching process applied to machines. The idea of an unorganised machine is defined, and it is suggested that the infant human cortex is of this nature. Simple examples of such machines are given, and their education by means of rewards and punishments is discussed. In one case the education process is carried through until the organisation is similar to that of an [ACE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Computing_Engine).

lsbb03,[D] How to be more productive while doing Deep Learning experiments?,"Wanted advice of expert Deep Learning practitioners on the following points.

1. How do you keep track of experiments you need to run including their priorities and deadlines?
2. Do you code multiple experiments simultaneously or sequentially? How do you remain productive if while debugging an experiment, it takes some time (say 30 min) to verify if the experiment is running fine?
3. In case you are working on multiple projects at the same time, how do you switch between their experiments?
4. Is it possible to be a good Deep Learning practitioner just working 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday? 
5. Any other tips you could share which improved your productivity greatly?

Personally, I feel my productivity is low even though I spend long hours at work. In a given day, I am able to just make one experiment work (including coding, right hyperparameters, etc), but the number of experiments I need to perform are huge.

11tmpc5,[D] PyTorch 2.0 Native Flash Attention 32k Context Window,"Hi,

I did a quick experiment with Pytorch 2.0 Native scaled\_dot\_product\_attention. I was able to a single forward pass within 9GB of memory which is astounding. I think by patching existing Pretrained GPT models and adding more positional encodings, one could easily fine-tune those models to 32k attention on a single A100 80GB. Here is the code I used:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6csxe28lv9oa1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff8b48a77f49fab7d088fd8ba220f720860249bc

I think it should be possible to replicate even GPT-4 with open source tools something like Bloom + FlashAttention & fine-tune on 32k tokens.

**Update**: I was successfully able to start the training of GPT-2 (125M) with a context size of 8k and batch size of 1 on a 16GB GPU. Since memory scaled linearly from 4k to 8k. I am expecting, 32k would require \~64GB and should train smoothly on A100 80 GB. Also, I did not do any other optimizations. Maybe 8-bit fine-tuning can further optimize it.

**Update 2**: I basically picked Karpaty's nanoGPT and patched the pretrained GPT-2 by repeating the embeddings N-times. I was unable to train the model at 8k because generation would cause the crash.  So I started the training for a context window of 4k on The Pile: 1 hour in and loss seems to be going down pretty fast. Also Karpaty's generate function is super inefficient, O(n\^4) I think so it took forever to generate even 2k tokens. So I generate 1100 tokens just to see if the model is able to go beyond 1k limit. And it seems to be working. [Here are some samples](https://0bin.net/paste/O-+eopaW#nmtzX1Re7f1Nr-Otz606jkltvKk/kUXY96/8ca+tb4f) at 3k iteration.

**Update 3**: I have started the training and I am publishing the training script if anyone is interested in replicating or building upon this work. Here is the complete training script:

[https://gist.github.com/NaxAlpha/1c36eaddd03ed102d24372493264694c](https://gist.github.com/NaxAlpha/1c36eaddd03ed102d24372493264694c)

I will post an update after the weekend once the training has progressed somewhat.

**Post-Weekend Update**: After \~50k iterations (the model has seen \~200 million tokens, I know this is just too small compared to 10s of billions trained by giga corps), loss only dropped from 4.6 to 4.2 on The Pile:

https://preview.redd.it/vi0fpskhsuoa1.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fccc5277d91a6400adc6d968b0f2f0ff0da2afc

AFAIR, the loss of GPT-2 on the Pile if trained with 1024 tokens is \~2.8. It seems like the size of the dimension for each token is kind of limiting how much loss can go down since GPT-2 (small) has an embedding dimension of 768. Maybe someone can experiment with GPT-2 medium etc. to see how much we can improve.

ie2bti,[D] Resources and topics to cover for entry level ML Software Engineering Interviews [Part 1: Stat ML],"Hi everyone,

I  had been giving a lot interviews from late 2017 to early 2019 in ML  software engineering roles. I thought I'll share a bunch of resources  and some topics to look out for.

You might be tested on a subset of the topics along with a generic leetcode coding question.

[https://github.com/Feynman687/Interviews/blob/master/StatML.md](https://github.com/Feynman687/Interviews/blob/master/StatML.md)

FYI:  I have interviewed a lot, including Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon,  Bloomberg, Quora, Walmart Labs, Allen AI, a lot of  mid sized companies  in Bay area (SoundHound, PocketGems etc) , a lot of new 10 member team  startups in Bay area (Blue Hexagon, Well said labs) and more. The list  is a combination of all the topics (statistical ML only) that I  encountered in those interviews. Of course, you may or may not be judged  on all but knowing a bit on such topics is always a plus. For example, I  never knew much on reservoir sampling until I was asked to ""derive a  proof for it"" in a Data Scientist interview for one of the above  mentioned companies. If you're thinking why reservoir sampling - it's an  effective strategy to calculate Mean/Median etc characteristic for a  fixed number of samples coming from a NRT (near real time) feed .

Anyway, I'll compile a list for other domains like Deep learning, ETL as well and post later. Thanks.

Why did I write this humorous, comprehensive blog?  Because I have been where you are now.  As a Humanities major (who once worked for “Saturday Night Live”), I suffered through two years of hell as I taught myself ML with online courses and blogs, and it was like drinking from a fire hose--too much information from too many experts with too many conflicting approaches, and my head was filled with confusion and self-doubt.  Could I really learn this stuff?

IMO, today’s AI books and online courses suffer from “Expert Blindness.”  Most of the experts have been experts for so long, and so deeply, that they forgot how a beginner sees the material.  My blog skips no steps as I use analogies, pictures, examples and humor to break the concepts down into bite-size, user-friendly pieces, with minimal expert blindness.  And every phrase has been double-checked by my mentor, who is a Stanford PhD in aerospace engineering.

It would make me happy to know I helped other folks to avoid the hell I went through.  Please pass this blog on to any ML rookies, and I welcome all constructive comments to improve this as a resource for all future ML engineers!

zstequ,[D] When chatGPT stops being free: Run SOTA LLM in cloud,"Edit: Found [LAION-AI/OPEN-ASSISTANT](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant) a very promising project opensourcing the idea of chatGPT. [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gVYC_QX1DI)

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

**TL;DR2: Trying to find likeminded people who are interested to run open source SOTA LLMs for when chatGPT will be paid or just for fun.**

>Seasonal mountain snowpack is a critical water resource  throughout the Western U.S. Snowpack acts as a natural reservoir by  storing precipitation throughout the winter months and releasing it as  snowmelt when temperatures rise during the spring and summer. This  meltwater becomes runoff and serves as a primary freshwater source for  major streams, rivers and reservoirs. As a result, snowpack accumulation  on high-elevation mountains significantly influences streamflow as well  as water storage and allocation for millions of people.  
>  
>Snow water equivalent (SWE)  is the most commonly used measurement in water forecasts because it  combines information on snow depth and density. SWE refers to the amount  of liquid water contained in a snowpack, or the depth of water that  would result if a column of snow was completely melted. Water resource  managers use measurements and estimates of SWE to support a variety of  water management decisions, including managing reservoir storage levels,  setting water allocations, and planning for extreme weather events.  
>  
>Over the past several decades, ground-based instruments including [snow course and SNOwpack TELemetry (SNOTEL) stations](https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snow/)  have been used to monitor snowpacks. While ground measures can provide  accurate SWE estimates, ground stations tend to be spatially limited and  are not easily installed at high elevations. Recently, high resolution  satellite imagery has strengthened snow monitoring systems by providing  data in otherwise inaccessible areas at frequent time intervals.  
>  
>Given the diverse landscape in the Western U.S. and shifting climate,  new and improved methods are needed to accurately measure SWE at a high  spatiotemporal resolution to inform water management decisions.  
>  
>**The goal of this challenge is to estimate snow water  equivalent (SWE) at a high spatiotemporal resolution over the Western  U.S. using near real-time data sources.**  Prizes will be awarded based on the accuracy of model predictions and write-ups explaining the solutions as described below.

>Getting better SWE estimates for mountain watersheds and headwater  catchments will help to improve runoff and water supply forecasts, which  in turn will help reservoir operators manage limited water supplies.  Improved SWE information will also help water managers respond to  extreme weather events such as floods and droughts.Seasonal mountain snowpack is a [critical water resource](https://www.watercalculator.org/footprint/importance-mountain-snowpack-water/)  throughout the Western U.S. Snowpack acts as a natural reservoir by  storing precipitation throughout the winter months and releasing it as  snowmelt when temperatures rise during the spring and summer. This  meltwater becomes runoff and serves as a primary freshwater source for  major streams, rivers and reservoirs. As a result, snowpack accumulation  on high-elevation mountains significantly influences streamflow as well  as water storage and allocation for millions of people.",350,17,EducationalCicada,2021-12-08 15:59:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/rbue4h/n_us_gov_launches_ml_competition_to_predict_snow/,0,MachineLearning
kqm5pn,[P] Which Machine Learning Classifiers are best for small datasets? An empirical study,"Although ""big data"" and ""deep learning"" are dominant, my own work at the Gates Foundation involves a lot of small (but expensive) datasets, where the number of rows (subjects, samples) is between 100 and 1000. For example, detailed measurements throughout a pregnancy and subsequent neonatal outcomes from pregnant women. A lot of my collaborative investigations involve fitting machine learning models to small datasets like these, and it's not clear what best practices are in this case.

Along with my own experience, there is some informal wisdom floating around the ML community. Folk wisdom makes me wary and I wanted to do something more systematic. I took the following approach:

* Get a lot of small classification benchmark datasets. I used a subset of this prepackaged repo. The final total was 108 datasets. (To do: also run regression benchmarks using this nice dataset library.)
* Select some reasonably representative ML classifiers: linear SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM (ensemble of gradient boosted decision trees), AugoGluon (fancy automl mega-ensemble).
* Set up sensible hyperparameter spaces.
* Run every classifier on every dataset via nested cross-validation.
* Plot results.

All the code and results are here: https://github.com/sergeyf/SmallDataBenchmarks

Let's look at the results. The metric of interest is weighted one-vs-all area under the ROC curve, averaged over the outer folds. The [plot](https://user-images.strikinglycdn.com/res/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,fl_lossy,h_9000,w_1200,f_auto,q_auto/174108/405478_658788.png)

Some observations:

* AutoGluon is best overall, but it has some catastrophic failures (AUROC < 0.5) that Logistic Regression does not and LightGBM has fewer of.
* You can't tell from this particular plot, but AutoGluon needs ""enough"" time. It has a budget parameter which tells it how much time to spend improving the fancy ensemble. Five minutes per fold was the minimum that worked well - this adds up to 108 datasets * 4 outer folds * 300s = 1.5 days for the entire benchmark.
* Linear SVC is better than Logistic Regression on average. There are also two datasets where SVC is 0.3 and 0.1 AUROC better than every other model. It's worth keeping in the toolbox.
* Logistic Regression needs the ""elasticnet"" regularizer to ensure it doesn't have the kind of awful generalization failures that you see with AutoGluon and Random Forest.
* LightGBM is second best. I used hyperopt to find good hyperparameters. I also tried scikit-optimize and Optuna, but they didn't work as well. User error is possible.
* Random Forest is pretty good, and much easier/faster to optimize than LightGBM and AutoGluon. I only cross-validated a single parameter for it (depth).

Here are counts of datasets where each algorithm wins or is within 0.5% of winning AUROC (out of 108):

* AutoGluon (sec=300): 71
* LightGBM (n_hyperparams=50): 43
* LightGBM (n_hyperparams=25): 41
* Random Forest: 32
* Logistic Regression: 28
* SVC: 23

And average AUROC across all datasets:

* AutoGluon (sec=300) - 0.885
* LightGBM (n_hyperparams=50) - 0.876
* LightGBM (n_hyperparams=25) - 0.873
* Random Forest - 0.870
* SVC - 0.841
* Logistic Regression - 0.835

And counts where each algorithm does the worst or is within 0.5% of the worst AUROC:

* Logistic Regression: 54
* SVC: 48
* Random Forest: 25
* LightGBM (n_hyperparams=25): 19
* LightGBM (n_hyperparams=50): 18
* AutoGluon (sec=300): 14

Which shows that even the smart ensemble can still fail 10% of the time. Not a single free lunch to be eaten anywhere.

[Here](https://user-images.strikinglycdn.com/res/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,fl_lossy,h_9000,w_1200,f_auto,q_auto/174108/900727_648400.png) is a plot of average (over folds) AUROC vs number of samples.

I was surprised when I saw this for the first time. The collective wisdom that I've ingested is something like: ""don't bother using complex models for tiny data."" But this doesn't seem true for these 108 datasets. Even at the low end, AutoGluon works very well, and LightGBM/Random Forest handily beat out the two linear models. There's an odd peak in the model where the linear models suddenly do better - I don't think it's meaningful.

The last [plot](https://user-images.strikinglycdn.com/res/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,fl_lossy,h_9000,w_1200,f_auto,q_auto/174108/378656_205907.png): standard deviation of AUROC across outer folds.

Linear models don't just generalize worse regardless of dataset size - they also have higher generalization variance. Note the one strange SVC outlier. Another SVC mystery...

**IID Thoughts**

How applicable are these experiments? Both levels of the nested cross-validation used class-stratified random splits. So the splits were IID: independent and identically distributed. The test data looked like the validation data which looked like the training data. This is both unrealistic and precisely how most peer-reviewed publications evaluate when they try out machine learning. (At least the good ones.) In some cases, there is actual covariate-shifted ""test"" data available. It's possible that LightGBM is better than linear models for IID data regardless of its size, but this is no longer true if the test set is from some related but different distribution than the training set. I can't experiment very easily in this scenario: ""standard"" benchmark datasets are readily available, but realistic pairs of training and covariate-shifted test sets are not.

**Conclusions & Caveats**

So what can we conclude?

* If you only care about the IID setting or only have access to a single dataset, non-linear models are likely to be superior even if you only have 50 samples.
* AutoGluon is a great way to get an upper bound on performance, but it's much harder to understand the final complex ensemble than, say, LightGBM where you can plot the SHAP values.
* hyperopt is old and has some warts but works better than the alternatives that I've tried. I'm going to stick with it.
* SVC can in rare cases completely dominate all other algorithms.

Caveats:

* LightGBM has a lot of excellent bells and whistles that were not at all used here: native missing value handling (we had none), smarter encoding of categorical variables (I used one-hot encoding for the sake of uniformity/fairness), per-feature monotonic constraints (need to have prior knowledge).
* AutoGluon includes a tabular neural network in its ensemble, but I haven't run benchmarks on it in isolation. It would be interesting to find out if modern tabular neural network architectures can work out-of-the-box for small datasets.
* This is just classification. Regression might have different outcomes.

Again, check out the code and feel free to add new scripts with other algorithms. It shouldn't be too hard. https://github.com/sergeyf/SmallDataBenchmarks

pyfjz7,[R] Deepmind's weather forecasting model 'Nowcasting' provides high-accuracy short-term weather prediction and better than traditional models for both accuracy and usefulness.,"In a trial by more than 50 expert forecasters, the Met Office tested ‘Nowcasting’ model for high-accuracy short-term weather prediction and found it better than traditional models for both accuracy and usefulness.

Accurate real-time weather predictions will become an increasingly important part of managing the effect of extreme weather. This research shows the potential of AI to help us tackle some of these challenges.

opj8g0,[D] Ghost town conferences,"I am hearing more and more stories of online conference paper/poster presentations without anybody other then the presenters themselves showing up. I have heard of situations like that already last year but what's special now (e.g. at ICML) is that it seems to become the standard (except for Google and Standford papers obviously). 

This trend pretty much aligns with how I attend, or more accurately stopped attending, such virtual conferences. For instance, at ICLR 2020 (the first virtual conference) I joined at least half of the keynotes and a handful of paper presentations. The time I spend at the virtual ICML 2020 was already significant less, even though I presented a paper there. This continued to the point where I only present my own papers and that's it. No keynote, no other paper presentation.

I think we have reached a point where virtual ""**live**"" conferences do not make sense anymore. We should ***stop pretending*** that important social interactions happen there, and just put the papers and 3-minute videos online. 

In this regard we should also think about how to move forward. With the new Covid variants and some of the vaccines (e.g. Sinopharm) not working well on them, I think having a ""normal"" physical conference anytime before 2023 is unrealistic. 

What are your thoughts about **virtual conferences becoming ghost towns**?",348,79,yusuf-bengio,2021-07-22 17:56:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/opj8g0/d_ghost_town_conferences/,0,MachineLearning
mgzvt2,"[D] What’s the simplest, most lightweight but complete and 100% open source MLOps toolkit? -> MY OWN CONCLUSIONS","Although I have posted this summary in the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/mfca0p/d_whats_the_simplest_most_lightweight_but/), most people won't find it, so to make it more visible I post it as another thread.

First of all, I have to thank the reddit ML community in general and each of you in particular for the detailed, insightful and interesting answers I have received in the past few days. I have learnt a lot and the picture in my head is now clearer. Now, I am posting a summary with the things that, for me, make more sense (it's my opinion and will serve as our guideline for making the decision, so it's not just a bare summary).

**General advice**

We should start with a reduced set of tools, the most useful ones, in order to have the flexibility to change or adapt our projects to a new infrastructure a provider could offer us. This is something that could happen.

**End-to-end solutions**

There are mainly two solutions that are 100% open source and free to install and use, and that may solve most of the requirements of ML practitioners: [Hopsworks](https://hopsworks.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [ClearML](https://allegro.ai/clearml/docs/). Among this two, if I had to chose one right now, it will be ClearML. Hopsworks might be much more complete, but ClearML seems to have a bigger community behind it and to be easier to install and use. So ClearML will be something to take a look at in case we go for an all-in-one package. I also like the idea of having a platform with an UI with all our projects.

**Python Programming**

[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) (including flake8-docstrings), [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/) and [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) are hugely recommended. [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) is something to take a look at too.

This morning I have found this [guide](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/) that might be worth it, as it covers many good practices. Also this [article](https://martinheinz.dev/blog/14).

Regarding the IDE, VSCode is not the same as Visual Studio, the most recommended one is VSCode.

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is also something to consider. But also one should be careful with it: its current development state is not very promising and maybe pip is more secure, as it is the official way.

**CI and Deployment**

Jenkins is a good tool, although maybe not the easiest one (Gitlab, Drone, and Circle are all easier to use). Docker might not be totally needed, but is hugely recommended as it is becoming a standard, and even many of the libraries rely on it (for example, ClearML does). In addition, it works very well with Jenkins.

We should switch from SVN to git (strongly recommended). [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is a good option.

**Project Scaffolding**

[CookieCutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/) or [Kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) are the winners. I still think we will stick to Kedro template, because it offers extra functionality, and I like to think of each project as a set of pipelines to be run. Anyway, some cookiecutter templates are very good, like this [one](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template). In case we use both Kedro and ClearML, we'll have to figure out how to integrate its pipelines with ClearML tasks. But in the slack channel of ClearML there are other teams doing the same, so at least it's possible.

**Documentation**

[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) for the documentation is totally recommended (Google style docstrings). [Napoleon](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html) can be very useful for helping with that. This covers documentation of the actual code. For documenting the business objective and other project related stuff, we could use jupyter notebooks in order to have everything inside the repo.

**Project registry**

ClearML if we finally chose it. Otherwise, we migth use an internal wiki or just the repository with a clear documentation.

**Data Exploration and Preparation**

We should use PySpark when things go ""big"", and Pandas when things fit in memory.

**Tests**

I expected Great Expectations library to be recommended, but nobody told anything. Instead, unit testing and/or smoke tests using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). And checking them with Jenkins. Anyway, if Kedro ends up being our project template, I'll keep an eye on the [plugin](https://github.com/tamsanh/kedro-great) with [Great Expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations).

**Feature Store, Data Versioning**

Maybe not so important in the beginning. [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc) looks good, but it's not easy to use.

**Workflow engine or orchestrator**

In our case, we have one, but otherwise it is an important piece. Prefect is maybe the option I like the most for its simplicity, but Luigi is also a tool that I like.

Kedro, also related with this, because it is a tool for defining pipelines, does not care about how to run the pipelines and you can deploy them in several engines like Luigi, Prefect, Airflow or Kubeflow.

**Model registry**

Its importance depends on several considerations:

* If you have too many models in production.
* If models are frecuently retrained.
* If lots of models are trained and or tested in parallel.
* If some models make real-time predictions, and their performance is critical.

If any of the previous point happens to be true, a model registry can be a very important piece of the MLOps solution. Otherwise, you can consider it not essential.

**Experimenting**

It's an important piece. If we use ClearML, this will be solved. Otherwise, we might try [MLFlow](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html) using Kedro-MLFlow or [PipelineX](https://pipelinex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

[Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) can be an interesting addition to define configurations, although Kedro does have a nice way too.

**Training**

Apart from the ""classical"" libraries, in case of DL for simplicity [PyTorch Lighting](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) will be our first option. Anyway, hardware limitations could be an issue (when models don't fit into memory, when training must be distributed... so that problems should be at least foreseen... both TensorFlow and PyTorch have ways of dealing with it).

**Model serving**

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). Or even simpler: [DL4J](https://deeplearning4j.org/), to be used in Java when we need to communicate with the rest of the applications in real time.

Other interesting solutions are [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML) and [Cortex](https://www.cortex.dev/), we should take a look at it too.

When high availability is important, we should take into account having redundant nodes and a resilient infraestructure (Kubernetes could be a solution).

**Visualization**

We should take a look at [voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html) and [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

**Model monitoring**

We could use Jenkins pipelines or ad-hoc scheduled processed. We don't need a tool for that.",349,76,fripperML,2021-03-31 06:32:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/mgzvt2/d_whats_the_simplest_most_lightweight_but/,0,MachineLearning
i49jf8,"[D] Biggest roadblock in making ""GPT-4"", a ~20 trillion parameter transformer","So I found this paper, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054) which pretty much describes how the GPT-3 over GPT-2 gain was achieved, 1.5B -> 175 billion parameters

# Memory

>Basic data parallelism (DP) does not reduce memory per device, and runs out of memory for models with more than 1.4B parameters on current generation of GPUs with 32 GB memory

The paper also talks about memory optimizations by clever partitioning of Optimizer State, Gradient between GPUs to reduce need for communication between nodes. Even without using Model Parallelism (MP), so still running 1 copy of the model on 1 GPU.

>ZeRO-100B can train models with up to 13B parameters without MP on 128 GPUs, achieving throughput over 40 TFlops per GPU on average. In comparison, without ZeRO, the largest trainable model with DP alone has 1.4B parameters with throughput less than 20 TFlops per GPU.

Add 16-way Model Parallelism in a DGX-2 cluster of Nvidia V100s and 128 nodes and you got capacity for around 200 billion parameters. From MP = 16 they could run a 15.4x bigger model without any real loss in performance, 30% less than peak performance when running 16-way model parallelism and 64-way data parallelism (1024 GPUs).

This was all from Gradient and Optimizer state Partitioning, they then start talking about parameter partitioning and say it should offer a linear reduction in memory proportional to number of GPUs used, so 64 GPUs could run a 64x bigger model, at a 50% communication bandwidth increase. But they don't actually do any implementation or testing of this.

# Compute

Instead they start complaining about a compute power gap, their calculation of this is pretty rudimentary. But if you redo it with the method cited by GPT-3 and using the empirically derived values by GPT-3 and the cited paper,   [https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361) 

Loss (L) as a function of model parameters (N) should scale,

L = (N/8.8 \* 10\^13)\^-0.076

Provided compute (C) in petaFLOP/s-days is,

L = (C/2.3\*10\^8)\^-0.05  ⇔ L = 2.62 \* C\^-0.05

GPT-3 was able to fit this function as 2.57 \* C\^-0.048

So if you just solve C from that,

[C = 2.89407×10\^-14 N\^(19/12)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28N%2F8.8*10%5E13%29%5E-0.076+%3D+2.57*C%5E-0.048+solve+C)

If you do that for the same increase in parameters as GPT-2 to GPT-3, then you get

C≈3.43×10\^7 for [20 trillion](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=C+%3D+2.89407%C3%9710%5E-14+N%5E%2819%2F12%29+and+N+%3D+175+billion+%2F+1.5+billion+*+175+billion) parameters, vs 18,300 for 175 billion. 10\^4.25 PetaFLOP/s-days looks around what they used for GPT-3, they say several thousands, not twenty thousand, but it was also slightly off the trend line in the graph and probably would have improved for training on more compute.

You should also need around 16 trillion tokens, GPT-3 trained on 300 billion tokens (function says 370 billion ideally). English Wikipedia was 3 billion. 570GB of webcrawl was 400 billion tokens, so 23TB of tokens seems relatively easy in comparison with compute.

With GPT-3 costing around [$4.6 million](https://lambdalabs.com/blog/demystifying-gpt-3/) in compute, than would put a price of [$8.6 billion](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3.43%C3%9710%5E7%2F18%2C300+*+%244.6M+) for the compute to train ""GPT-4"".

If making bigger models was so easy with parameter partitioning from a memory point of view then this seems like the hardest challenge, but you do need to solve the memory issue to actually get it to load at all.

However, if you're lucky you can get 3-6x compute increase from Nvidia A100s over V100s,  [https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/)

But even a 6x compute gain would still put the cost at $1.4 billion.

Nvidia only reported $1.15 billion in revenue from ""Data Center"" in 2020 Q1, so just to train ""GPT-4"" you would pretty much need the entire world's supply of graphic cards for 1 quarter (3 months), at least on that order of magnitude.

The Department of Energy is paying AMD $600 million to build the 2 Exaflop El Capitan supercomputer. That supercomputer could crank it out in [47 years](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3.43%C3%9710%5E7+petaFLOPS*+days++%2F+%282+EXAFLOPS%29).

To vastly improve Google search, and everything else it could potentially do, $1.4 billion or even $10 billion doesn't really seem impossibly bad within the next 1-3 years though.",354,138,AxeLond,2020-08-05 17:21:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/i49jf8/d_biggest_roadblock_in_making_gpt4_a_20_trillion/,0,MachineLearning
